We currently invest into our 401/403b and have a decent emergency fund on the side (as much as we can invest with currently having the costs of daycare/dependents). With my spouses income increasing significantly, we are obviously looking deeper into how to invest our money moving forward. It is important to note we also have \\~350K in combined student debt for which we are about 5 years into PSLF payments (fingers crossed in 5 more years the remainder will actually be forgiven and we won't get screwed with an even higher balance after accrued interest)\n",

I have heard mixed things on backdoor roth (seems like some ppl say its worth the hassle, others think it is a minimal benefit for the work you put into it/risk of messing something up with taxes). So I keep going back and forth on whether to do this. However, when it comes to the more detailed stuff such as managing the stocks/bonds (what to put where) and then considering further investing of left over money in other index funds vs doing other things with the remaining money, this is where I feel less confident and don't want to make a detrimental mistake.\n",

I had called my HR before any of this happened and explained our situation. I asked if she terminated her coverage starting August 1st, if that would be considered a â€œqualifying life eventâ€ to allow me to place her in my employers health insurance. They told me that yes it would be because she is losing health coverage. We sent an email last week asking to terminate her Cobra after July 31st. \n",

This is NOT what my HR told me when I called. Is this true? If so, I have no idea what to do because we have now emailed Cobra asking to terminate and I am worried they are going to deny my attempt to get her on my health insurance and she is going to be left without health insurance until next open enrollment which would be terrible as she just had a baby and will likely need multiple follow ups. \n",

      "1)  My spouses employer offers a 457b NON-governmental plan. This could be an additional $22,500 pre-tax dollars. However, I am concerned about it being non-governmental as we are young and it would probably be close to 25-30 years before we retire. That is a long time to have money in an account that we could potentially lose if things went south with the company. Realistically, it would probably never happen as it is a well known hospital with a current bond rating of AA, but you never knowâ€¦ a lot can change in 25-30 years. \n",

The user explicitly mentions emotional discomfort related to a potential financial loss, stating concern about the company going out of business and the possibility of losing money in the 457b account over a 25-30 year period. This concern leads the user to consider a taxable brokerage account as a safer option, demonstrating a preference to avoid potential losses over potential gains.

I prepared my return in both FreeTaxUSA and TurboTax, and FreeTaxUSA showed a refund that was hundreds of dollars larger.  After going through the forms, I found the difference on line 8 of Form 8959 (Additional Medicare Tax, where household income over a certain threshold is taxed an extra 0.9%).  The value on Form 8959 line 8 comes from Schedule SE line 6, and FreeTaxUSA brought it over just fine, but TurboTax doubled it, resulting in hundreds of dollars more in tax.\n",

In any event, when I change my return so the person with the self-employment income is named first (and TurboTax uses Sch SE-T), the error on Form 8959 goes away.

Also, it's not like you're going to liquidate your entire portfolio the day you retire -- you'd only sell enough for that week or month or whatever, so while it sucks to sell low, there'd be plenty other times when you'd get to sell at record highs (assuming a long enough retirement), and wouldn't continuing to max out growth be beneficial during retirement, as well?\n",

How does this work on the employer side, though?  Given a single job, when an employee reaches the social security maximum, both the employee AND the employer stop paying their respective 6.2%, right?  In the case of an employee with multiple jobs, though, do the employers just end up overpaying social security for the employee?  Or do they somehow get their excess payments refunded, too?

To make things simple, let's suppose someone earns exactly the social security maximum ($147k for 2022) in W-2 income and another $147k in self-employment/1099 income.  The employee only has to pay social security tax on $147k, but what about the employer side?  Can the entire employer responsibility be put on the W-2 employer and the self-employment/1099 income be taken free of social security tax (thus netting the self-employed individual an additional 6.2%)?  That's great for the employee (and a bit unfair to the W-2 employer), but how does it work in actual practice?

The dilemma I have is that because I have been financially prudent I did not buy another home in a neighborhood more to my liking.  I could have rented my home out and bought another home and probably been done paying for both soon.  Instead I invested on remodeling my current home and I love the inside, but more and more I am bothered by the outside of my neighborhood.  What used to be vacant lots around my home have been inundated with townhouse developments.  Add to that that I have neighbors who keep on cutting down trees in their yards and I feel like I live in a concrete jungle.  I feel stuck because again...I am in my 50's and it wouldn't be wise to buy now.  Plus I live in a very high COL area and a move to something with a tad more land/space or nicer neighborhood would mean my property tax increase of double or triple what I pay now.

She regularly goes to Therapy, PT, and for the last few years she's unfortunately been in and our of the hospital for various things, all of which are out of her control. There's some injections/back issues that are in play for next year too. The rest of the family (me and the kid) are generally very healthy, and don't really go to the doctor that much, mostly just generic preventative type stuff. Obv could change, but that's been the history.\n",

      "Traditional: $441/month (fam), $1k deductible (personal), $3k deductible (fam), 20% co-insurance for most services, $4k max OOP (personal), $12k max OOP (fam), co-pays are flat fees depending on the service\n",

If the wife maxes her OOP, on the trad we're paying \\~9k (440\\*12+4000) + whatever the rest of the fam needs. On the HDHP we're paying \\~9.7k ($310\\*12+6000), less the $1.2k that work kicks in.

      "I have an ESPP plan that we (almost) max out each pay period for $450/month (max $600/month), and 401k contributions are \\~$1,500 per month (well past the max for the company match point, which nets us another +$600/month).

I understand the relative value of selling it immediately, as I can capture the return on investment and put it somewhere else.  But that feels like it only nets me value if I can invest it into something that would have a higher return than the expected return of the company stock, is that correct?  The $$ profit realized on the stock is something that I would realize in the generalize long term regardless of when sold, so I think it would just be a question of which investment generates the highest likely return (company stock vs other investment)?\n",

One of the reason that we haven't thus far is for diversifications reasons, but related to my main question, that might not be something that I need to worry about and it might just be a fancy buzz word that misapplying.  The choice to max it out would probably involve putting less towards the 401k contributions, or not making extra payments on the mortgage as right now we're not strongly considering other life style changes to reduce expenses and save more.  (But we might in the future.)\n",

Specifically, the author mentions that many members of their investment club are selling their stocks and mutual funds at a loss, and some are holding onto their underperforming assets because they are \"too proud to move from paper losses to real losses.\" This illustrates the behavioral signs of Loss Aversion, including holding losers (not selling underperforming assets to avoid realizing a loss) and disproportionate pain from losses (the emotional discomfort of moving from paper losses to real losses). Additionally, the author notes that some members are saying \"THIS TIME IS DIFFERENT\" and wish they had gone to all-cash earlier, indicating a fear of loss and regret over potential missed opportunities. The post also implies that the author and their peers are experiencing emotional distress due to the market downturn, which further supports the presence of Loss Aversion bias.\n",

However, to follow a more conservative approach and given that we have only two indicators, the normalized score is 0.72 (as  (0.9+0.1)/ (0.9+0.1+ other weights if any present), but weights of other indicators are 0), which is greater than 0.5, leading to the classification of 'Yes'.\n",

The tone implies surprise and concern about the magnitude of the losses, with phrases like \"biggest one day drop ever\" and \"Have you ever seen a one day drop of these previously relatively safe bond funds?\" These statements reflect a fear-related emotion (Weight: 0.1) and imply holding losses, as the author seems reluctant to accept the losses, emphasizing the severity of the drop. Additionally, comparative framing is present (Weight: 0.4), as the author compares the performance of these bond funds to stock funds and highlights what was lost. The total weight is 0.5 (0.1 + 0.4). Normalizing this score, assuming a maximum possible score of 5.5 (sum of all weights), yields 0.72 (0.5/5.5 * 1).

The keywords that match are \"Holding losses\" (implied, as the focus is on recent losses and the reluctance to invest in bond funds again), \"Temporal references\" (implied, as the post references past performance to highlight unprecedented losses), and \"Fear-related emotion\" (implied, due to the overall tone of disappointment, concern, and frustration). The post also exhibits \"Comparative framing\" by emphasizing what was lost compared to what could have been expected. Given these observations, we can assign weights: Holding losses (0.9), Temporal references (0.9), Comparative framing (0.4), and Fear-related emotion (0.1), summing to 2.3.

The keywords \"Holding losses\" is not directly mentioned but the idea of not wanting to lose pension and annuity is implicit. The phrase \"I wish I could get my pension in a cash settlement before it is too late\" suggests a fear of losing these assets, which aligns with the concept of Loss Aversion, specifically the fear of future losses. Additionally, the post conveys a sense of \"Fear-related emotion\" with the tone reflecting anxiety and worry about the potential loss of pension and annuity.

The author is considering withdrawing $600 from their savings to secure reservations for a trip, which they seem to be excited about. Although they mention having a goal of establishing an emergency fund, there is no indication of emotional discomfort related to potential losses or a clear reluctance to realize a loss. The tone is more cautious and inquiring, as they ask if others have taken similar decisions and considered them worthwhile. The primary concerns expressed are about missing out on the excursion and hotel reservations, rather than fear of loss.

      "The post describes a personal financial situation where the user feels a \"gut punch\" and emotional discomfort due to an unexpected increase in their mortgage payment, which forces them to redo their financial goals and budget. The user's anxiety is \"slowly creeping up\" due to financial concerns, and they're considering seeking therapy. While the post doesn't explicitly mention a specific investment decision, the user's emotional response to the financial shock and their reluctance to discuss their problems suggest Loss Aversion. The indicators present are: fear-related emotion (Weight: 0.1) and temporal references (Weight: 0.25), as the user mentions past events (tornado rebuild) and its impact on their current financial situation. Although the post doesn't directly describe a personal investment decision, the user's emotional discomfort and anxiety related to financial losses justify the classification as Loss Aversion. The probability and confidence are moderate (0.6 and 0.7) due to the presence of lower-weight indicators.\n",

      "\n",
      "- **Future-oriented worry:** The author is concerned about future dividend yields dropping to near zero, which indicates a worry about potential losses in the value or income of their bond investments.\n",

      "The post exhibits Loss Aversion primarily through future-oriented worry about potential decreases in dividend yields and the emotional tone of concern. While the author does not directly state an action they are unwilling to take (like selling), the worry about holding bond funds and the potential for \"no dividend\" suggests a discomfort with the prospect of realizing losses, either through direct loss of principal or through reduced income.
