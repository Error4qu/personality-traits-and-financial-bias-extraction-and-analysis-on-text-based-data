We're submitting an offer on our first home which is a townhouse/condo.  Property is in Southern California if you're wondering why the price is so ridiculous.  Anyways, I've only reached out to one two lenders and received this quote from one of them.  This is one of our realtors preferred finance people to work with.  I have $105,000 in downpayment/closing cost funds to play with.  I'm trying to get as much of that to go towards the principal/offset the loan amount as possible.

t3qkj7,CenterKnurl,"Father Had Stroke, No Health Insurance, Nevada

**Summary**: Father is a self-employed in a skilled trade.  Had a stroke out of the blue (in his mid-50's) and does not currently have health insurance.  I've been called in (his daughter) to pick up the pieces.  He residents in Nevada and that's also where the stroke happened.  Stroke occurred during sleep.  Moderate stroke, led to a 4-day hospital stay at a County-run hospital where an MRI and numerous echos were conducted.  My dad is doing pretty well and is slowly getting back into work, but I can tell there's some residual confusion/disorientation.  He's probably 90-95% functional (based on me hanging out with him for a day or two).

**Insurance Going Forward**

My first goal here is to get him insured.  The hospital gave him two different paperwork packets.  The first is a Medicaid application.  The second is a charity care application.  According to the hospital, individuals must make $1483 or less per month to qualify for Medicaid.  My father is a sole proprietor, so he purposely keeps tabs on everything to ensure his reportable income remains as low as possible.  However, his income can fluctuate wildly though.  One month, he may make $10,000, the next month, $500.  How does this work with Medicaid?  Does some one have continuously apply and verify throughout the year?

**Paying Bills Soon to Accumulate**

Bills have not yet arrived, but we're preparing for some whoppers.  Hospital already offering a ""30% discount"" because he is considered ""cash pay.""  If he is approved for Medicaid, will Medicaid help pay for the hospital stay that already occurred retroactively?  What about if I get him signed up through the ACA exchange within the week? 

Next step will be to negotiate the bills down.  My dad owns his house and vehicles outright, but I'm concerned the bills (even under a payment plan) will be huge.  What can I do to minimize the impact this will have to his credit?

**Outside the Box Ideas**

Since my dad had a stroke, does that open any possibility of me becoming his legal caretaker or something whereby he'd qualify to be covered under my family insurance?  I have very good health insurance through my employer in California.",Yes,Yes,No,Yes,No
t82r3p,CenterKnurl,"Negotiating Hospital Bill - Are these charges unusual?

So this does not have to do with insurance, but does have to do with a hospital bill.  My father was hospitalized a few weeks ago for a stroke and he was uninsured at that time.  So far, the bill is $84,840.27.  Since he is ""cash pay,"" the hospital has offered a 30% discount right off the bat, so this bill is $59,338.18.  I'm not sure if this 30% discount is only available if you pay off the whole bill at once.  I hope that is not the case.  I received an itemized copy of the bill, which I've posted here: [https://imgur.com/a/JGQIRMo](https://imgur.com/a/JGQIRMo)

From what I've read, I should be combing through this bill to dispute any charges that seem excessive or incorrect.  All I know is that he was in the hospital for four days and basically waiting around the whole time.  According to the nurse, he should have been in and out in two days, but the hospital was busy, so he was there for four.  Not sure if this helps from a negotiation standpoint.  

Do any of these charges look unusual or look like something that can be negotiated down?

I'm in a position where I unexpectedly cannot get life insurance.  I am 32 and have a pre-existing health condition (heart related) and have been denied from basically every carrier.  Admittedly, I was clueless about life insurance up until a few weeks ago, but I am where I am and I totally get why I look more risky on paper then someone else.  That said, I am the primary breadwinner for my family.  Mortgage debt is $595,000 (literally just bought a house) on a 30-yr mortgage.  Combined income is a about $200k.  HCOL area.  One step child (my wife's child who has a 50/50 custody arrangement with the father).  I'd like to protect my wife financially when I die in general, but more specifcally, the house, as she cannot make the mortgage payment on her own over a long period of time.

What are my options?  If I can't get an insurance product, what's the most tax efficient way for me to set aside savings that will transfer to her when I die?  I already max out my Roth IRA yearly (

current value $30,000) and I have a public pension.  I also have a Rollover IRA from my previous employer with about $80,000 in it.  My work offers life insurance standard at one-year's salary.  I tried increasing that voluntarily, but was denied.  I am currently researching how the death benefit of my pension plan works, but it will take some time.

w260j2,CenterKnurl,"Medical Review for Life Mortgage Protection Insurance

33 year old male, healthy, working a full-time office job.  I have a congenital heart condition that definitely makes me a risk for life insurance providers. My prognosis is good, but I'm definitely in a high risk group relative to the general population. Iâ€™m trying to find a policy that will cover me so that my wife will not lose our mortgaged home if I die. I am the primary breadwinner and weâ€™re in a high cost of living area.  Iâ€™ve tried to find typical life insurance through two different brokers and even tried on my own online with no luck. I now have a broker that says we should submit an application and just try to get through underwriting to get a mortgage-only life insurance policy. The policy will just cover the remainder of the mortgage balance if I pass away. Part of the application process will be a medical records review.

I currently receive basic life insurance through my work, which is one-years salary payable on death. Last year, I tried to add coverage onto that policy, but was denied. I had to fill out a form that required me to check the box for heart conditions and thatâ€™s why I think I was denied. I could not find out any more information from my workâ€™s HR department.

Question: is there any reason why I shouldnâ€™t go for the life insurance that just covers the mortgage balance and submit to a medical records review?

I'm planning to retire at around age 45. I am currently 33 years old and have about $900,000 saved.

Regardless I'm thinking rental property would be a good way to carry me further along without touching my nest egg.however every time I've looked at a multi-family property the commercial loan terms seem unfavorable or they are not leaving enough room for paying down the mortgage aggressively because the cash flow is so tight. plus I know right now is probably not the best time to buy property with the market being so hot.

I've had one day job and a side hustle for the past couple years and I've gotten decent tax returns over the past couple years. 

In 2020, my sister moved into my condo and started paying me rent (in August so 5 months). I moved out as an FYI so she pays a significant amount. That said, I was doing my taxes this year and saw that I actually will be owing Federal and State (less than $100 total so no big deal), but does that make sense as to why?

We enter a recession and his growth mutual fund has crashed 50% and now is valued at $25.00 a share. Doug is retired and needs to pay his bills and takes 4% out of his investment portfolio every year. He sells 4% of his mutual fund that dropped 50% and is now selling at $25.00 a share.  After his withdrawal, he has lost 54% of his investment portfolio.

Mark owns a high yield stock mutual fund that also dropped 50% during the bear market. His high yield mutual fund has a 4% yield. The dividend is paid once a year every December. Mark pays his retirement bills with the 4% annual distribution from the dividend of his mutual fund.  Mark feels like a genius because he lives on dividends and does not touch the principal.  After spending the 4% dividend he still has the same number of shares he had before. I told him he is no better off than Doug because on the ex-dividend day the value of his stock dropped an equal amount of the dividend.

After three days and evenings at the Blackjack table, I am up about 30% of my original bankroll. Instead of cashing in my chips every day I brought them up to my hotel room and admired them and counted them again and again. I dreamed about what I could do with my winnings.

On the 4th day, my luck at the Blackjack table took a turn for the worse and I started to lose money.  I stopped gambling and cashed in my chips.

Jerry retired at age 62 but does not need his Social Security checks.  (He has a nice pension and investments.)   But he still decides to start collecting benefits starting at age 62 and invests the money.  in a 60-40 mutual fund. His first Social Security check is about $1500 a month which increases each year by the rate of inflation (1-3% a year)

On his 70th Birthday, he has about $220K in his investment account from deposits and capital gains from his invested Social Security Checks.

His twin brother Ben also decided to retire at age 62 but won't collect SS until he is 70. Ben was proud to say his SS checks will be almost twice the amount of his twin brother Jerry because he waited to 70 to collect. (Even though they had about the same lifetime income.)

Jerry- who collected SS at age 62-  decided to challenge Ben to a contest. Starting at age 70 he would withdraw from his $220K nest egg the difference between their Social Security checks so they both were given the same amount of money per month. AGAIN, Jerry would withdraw about $1500 a month out of his $220K nest egg he got from investing his smaller SS checks for 8 years so he would have the same income as Ben. (Social Security check + $1500 a month will match Ben's larger SS payment.)  The ending date of the contest is age 90.

Jerry insists because he started the contest with $220K, he can live into his 90s and still come out ahead because he will still be earning investment returns from his initial nest egg.

There is some truth to it but I believe the statement at face value is false.

In other words, history repeats itself over and over so we can be 90% sure in the future it will keep happening:

**Here are some examples of investing rules of thumb that have been true historically and with 90% certainty will continue to be true:**

Short Term Bond funds are less volatile than Long Term Bond Funds

A Bear Market in short term and intermediate bond funds is not as harsh as a bear market in stocks

Growth Small Company stocks are more volatile than large blue chips

Consumer Staple Stocks are less volatile than NASDAQ Technology Stocks in a bear market

If Stocks crash in a bear market they go back up within a few years (Every bear market has had a recovery.)

If the economy continues to grow the stock market long term trend will be up.

Stocks with very high dividend yields are more likely to be volatile than a stock with a smaller dividend yield

I want to show you the math behind the advantages of having separate total stock and total bond funds vs using balanced mutual funds.

Jim retired on October 1st, 2007 and had 2 Million Dollars in his 401K retirement account and is using the 4% rule and is planning on withdrawing a starting figure of $6666 a month which will be adjusted for inflation. He has two accounts 60% of his money is in a total stock market fund and 40% in a total bond market fund. Just when he retires the stock market starts to crash so he pulls his $6666 a month withdrawal out of his bond fund so he does not sell his stocks when they are down. On March 1, 2009, just before the stock market hits bottom he has $955,736 in his total Bond Fund and $519,680 in his total stock market fund. ($1,475,416 combined) Starting in March 2009 he took his monthly withdrawals equally from both funds. On February 2020 he has $2,598,449 left.

Peter also retired on October 2007 and had $2 Million in retirement and put it all in a 60-40 Mutual Fund. On March 1st he had $1,164,377 in his Balanced 60-40 Mutual Fund (FBALX) He took an inflation-adjusted starting amount of $6666.00 a month out of that fund from October 2007 to February 2020. So, in the end, on February 2020 he had $2,489,195 left.

Why the difference? Because Peter used a balanced mutual fund that was selling stocks during the Great Recession (due to the investment having 60% in stocks). While Jim only withdrew from his bond funds during the 2007-2009 stock market crash.

So I am having some upcoming life changes, and was hoping I could get some advice on filling out the 2023 W4. My end goal would be to get as close to not owing, but also not having too much of a refund at the end of the years as possible. Although, it doesn't need to be perfect. I just do not want it weighed heavily one way or the other. 

I am currently married and file jointly. I am making \~130,000/year and my spouse makes \~75,000/year. We have 1 dependent. We have some changes coming up, and I plan to redo both of our W4s. 

Starting next week, my spouse will be starting a new job making \~230,000-250,000/year. My spouse is pregnant and will only be working at the new job for about 3-6 weeks before needed to take a 3 month leave. After 3 months, my spouse will return to work full time at the job with the above salary. Obviously this will also increase our dependents to ""2"" come 3-6 weeks from now. 

My question is, what would be the best way to fill out our W4s to get as close to my original goal as possible? I am pretty new to the new W4s and am a bit confused. I am also not sure how my spouse taking a 3 month leave should be taken into consideration when adjusting our W4s. Will this change the timing of when to submit new W4s, etc.?

However, my spouse will need to fill out a W4 prior to employment within the next week.

14tp2yh,CHB12312,"Recommendations on personal finance podcasts/videos/books vs financial advisor

I was looking for some advise/recommendations regarding personal financing with some major changes that are happening in my life. I currently average 130k a year. I have two dependents (young children in daycare-AKA second mortgage) and my spouse is currently making \~70k a year but starting in a week will be making \~230-250k a year. We currently invest into our 401/403b and have a decent emergency fund on the side (as much as we can invest with currently having the costs of daycare/dependents). With my spouses income increasing significantly, we are obviously looking deeper into how to invest our money moving forward. It is important to note we also have \~350K in combined student debt for which we are about 5 years into PSLF payments (fingers crossed in 5 more years the remainder will actually be forgiven and we won't get screwed with an even higher balance after accrued interest)

I was considering a financial advisor, but I have heard a lot of mixed opinions on whether it is worth it and I don't want to lose out on a lot of money long term. I also considered maybe seeing if a financial advisor could help screen over our situation and start a portfolio and then we take it from there for a flat fee (if this is a thing?). 

However, I am also interested in learning more about personal financing myself. I feel like I have a decent understanding of the basics. I know to max out pre-tax accounts like 401k/403b first. Also maxing out the HSA (especially since I have dependents) which can also be used as a mini retirement account later in life. I have heard mixed things on backdoor roth (seems like some ppl say its worth the hassle, others think it is a minimal benefit for the work you put into it/risk of messing something up with taxes). So I keep going back and forth on whether to do this. However, when it comes to the more detailed stuff such as managing the stocks/bonds (what to put where) and then considering further investing of left over money in other index funds vs doing other things with the remaining money, this is where I feel less confident and don't want to make a detrimental mistake.

I guess my question is... is is worth working with a financial advisor with our current situation/incomes? Or should I be doing more research and trying to manage it myself? If the consensus is to manage it myself, does anyone have any advice on the better books/podcasts/videos that can get me started in starting to research this stuff?

Current situation: I make \~130k/year and my spouse was making \~80k/year. I believe we filled out the W4 by checking the 2(c) option on both of our W4s. We have both worked full time this year up until now. 

Upcoming situation: I will continue to make \~130k/year. However, my spouse started new employment earlier this week and will now be making \~220-250k/year (170k base and the rest with call pay, productivity bonuses, etc.). The caveat is that my spouse will likely work 4-6 weeks and then be taking a 3 month leave for the birth of a child. After that, my spouse will return to work full time. 

I am trying to decide the best way to fill out our W4s with this new change. I know to list the dependents on my spouses W4 (higher income W4). I hear the online calculator is the most accurate, however, my spouse won't get a pay check for \~ 3 weeks and even then it may not be the most accurate as it will be smaller than some other paychecks that will have call pay. 

What would be the best way to go about filling out our W4s to achieve my original goal? Here are the options I was thinking:

1: Using option 2(B) the multiple jobs worksheet as that uses both of our projected incomes. If I go this route, I believe we only fill this out on my spouses (higher income) W4, correct? And leave it blank on mine? 

2: Using the 2C option. However, I have heard mixed opinions on this. Is our income difference too much for this option? If so, what would it result in? Withholding too much from our paychecks?

So my spouse just started a new job and the salary is going from 80k to ~230k. The yearly contribution to the 403b is currently around 7k from her previous job. Obviously we will have a pretty significant income jump. She will also have to take off 3 months. So she will essentially work a total of 3 months by the end of year. She is getting a pretty nice sign on bonus and I still work so money shouldnâ€™t be an issue.

Two questions..

1) Is there a max per paycheck that you are aloud to contribute to your 403b?

2) If the above answer is â€œnoâ€â€¦ then does it make sense to start off with a large contribution towards her 403b (like 40%) for those 3 months to try and max out the rest of her 403b limit before the end of the year to try and take advantage of the pre-tax dollars and then switch back to a normal contribution in 2024?

We bought our house a few years back in early 2019. It was around 325k at the time with 4.375%. We didnâ€™t put down a down payment as we didnâ€™t have a lot of money saved (first home) and my wife was in residency (fixed income). We wanted a bigger house (we were renting) because we were having a baby at the time. We were able to get this house using a â€œdoctors loanâ€ knowing when my wife became an attending, income would significant change.

Itâ€™s now 2023 and we still owe 295k. I was just reviewing our personal finances as she just became an attending physician and our financial situation has obviously changed. However I am shocked after almost 5 years of ~$2,200 payments that we still owe 295k. 

I was looking at a mortgage statement form last month and it shows $500 towards principal, $1000 interest, ~$800 escrow. Seems crazy (although I understand without a down payment it will be higher). It just feels kind of defeating. 

So I guess I have a few questions with with our upcoming lifestyle changes taking place. 

1) From my research on this thread, I hear that typically you shouldnâ€™t focus on paying down mortgage as itâ€™s considered a low interest investment and money would be better focused elsewhere (such as maxing out 401ks, HSA, back door roths, etc). 

But with us having never put down a down payment, should we save up and try and put down 15-20% to lower the total loan some so we are not paying so much in interest? Or just focus our extra money elsewhere?

2) is this normal for only 1/4 of your total mortgage payment to actually go towards the principal? If soâ€¦ thatâ€™s lame. If not, what could I be doing wrong?",,,,,

This is my current plan, please let me know if there is any adjustments I could make/add to further optimize our portfolio.

For the year of 2024, this is my plan....

Me: Max out my 401k, set up a ""backdoor roth"" and max this

Spouse: Max out her 403b. Also set up and max out a backdoor roth for her. Her company also offers an additional 457 plan. ***Should we max out both her 403b AND 457 plan???***

We also are going to be on a high deductible plan so we plan to Max out HSA contributions each year as well

1) Should I max out both my spouses 403b AND 457? Is this overkill?

2) Is there any changes you would make to this plan?

My job offers a 401k. My spouses job offers a 403b and also has the option for a 457 (due to my spouses higher income). We also have an HSA account. We are also considering back door Roth accounts for the both of us. 

Ideally, I would like to max out my 401k ($22,500), my spouses 403b ($22,500), my spouses 457 (an additional $22,500), the HSA ($7500) and both of our back door roths (an additional $13,000).

So my spouse and I were covered under her health insurance through her employer. She left her job 7/10/23 and I switched over to my employers health insurance plan. She elected to stay on her plan via Cobra for the month of July because she was pregnant and due to deliver in July. She stayed on Cobra because she was close to her out of pocket max and if she switched to my health insurance, it wouldnâ€™t have covered her delivering at the hospital she was planning to deliver. 

She ended up delivering at the end of July. From my understanding you can terminate Cobra coverage at any time (pay on a monthly basis). I had called my HR before any of this happened and explained our situation. I asked if she terminated her coverage starting August 1st, if that would be considered a â€œqualifying life eventâ€ to allow me to place her in my employers health insurance. They told me that yes it would be because she is losing health coverage. We sent an email last week asking to terminate her Cobra after July 31st. 

However, now I am doing further research, and many websites are saying that you can terminate cobra at any time, but this is NOT considered a â€œqualifying life eventâ€ and that you would not be able to be added to a spouses insurance plan unless it was during open enrollment or you had another qualifying event. This is NOT what my HR told me when I called. Is this true? If so, I have no idea what to do because we have now emailed Cobra asking to terminate and I am worried they are going to deny my attempt to get her on my health insurance and she is going to be left without health insurance until next open enrollment which would be terrible as she just had a baby and will likely need multiple follow ups. 

What do I do? Is it true that this will not qualify as a life event and that I am not going to be able to get her on my insurance? If so, what options do I have. Do we try and call Cobra back on Monday and ask them not to cancel the coverage and just get screwed with $600 monthly payments until my next enrollment period?

1)  My spouses employer offers a 457b NON-governmental plan. This could be an additional $22,500 pre-tax dollars.

We have a 401k with ~$90,000 and a 403b with ~$100,000

Obviously we plan on continuing this for another 5 years at which point we hope to have the remaining balance forgiven. The issue is..... as we all know.. the PSLF journey is dreadful and thus I have a lot of anxiety around whether it will truly get forgiven in the end or if something will happen. I would like to have a backup plan, but I also don't want to make the wrong choice if it were to work out.

  
So my question is what should I do with the remaining 5k each month?  
1. Place it into my HYSA so it makes some money and keep it as a PSLF backup plan to pay off our student loan debt in 5 years if PSLF doesn't work out  
2. Invest it in something like a taxable brokerage account and hope the PSLF works and likely not have much disposable income besides emergency fund available in 5 years in case PSLF doesn't work. This would obviously be a better option if PSLF DOES work out as it would likely generate more money than a HYSA  
3. Morgage was around 330k. Interest rate around 4.85% Current remaining is about 290k (we didn't have much money at the time of buying the house to put a big down payment). Use a lot of this money to help pay down some of the mortgage

17zz326,CHB12312,"Seeking Help on Path to Financial Independence

Here are the current numbers....

Married filing jointly with 2 children. We are in our mid 30s. Combined annual income of about 360-380k/year (recently increased to this amount, previously around 190k)

Auto loan \~$30,000 at 4%. Second car is paid off and worth about 16k 

Mortgage: 290k (original 325k) at 4%. House is now worth 500k in current market

Student Loans: I have about 120k and my spouse has about 225k. We are currently pursuing PSLF. Both 5 years into it. Currently low monthly payments (<$10) because still using pre-covid income. This will change obviously. Our plan is to make the minimum payment on SAVE plan for another 5 years and hopefully have this forgiven

401k- $95,000 and a 403b with $100,000

HYSA $15,000; checking $12,000

Sadly with 2 children have to pay around $3200/month in daycare costs (hoping when the one starts going to kindergarten that the before/after day care will be cheaper?

Leftover pay after all our expenses each month: About $5,000-$6,000/month

**Our current plan:** Max the 401k, 403b, max backdoor roth for both of us, max HSA. My spouse also qualifies for a 457b which we are considering maxing as well. The largest stressors for me is the student loans. Obviously if PSLF works out, this will make a huge impact on our financial situation. However, I am a pessimistic, so I would like to be prepared in case for some reason it doesn't work out in 5 years. So my thought was taking the extra 5-6k we make each month and just dumping it into a HYSA so that way if at 5 years the PSLF doesn't work, I can use that amount to pay off the majority of student loans. If PSLF does work out, great I will invest/use that money to pay off any other debts at that time

This above plan may change some once we have to recertify incomes in the next 1-2 years as we will then likely have a decent sized student loan monthly payment (not sure how much this will be with out debt to income ratio).

How does our path to FI look so far? I often stress with the large amount of student debt and can't help but feel like FI is far off for us. It feels even harder with the cost of everything going up with inflation and childcare costs being so expensive. We are in medicine, so we are getting a bit of a late start. Is there any other adjustments to our plan that you would recommend? I appreciate any advice/feedback.

10cp4dg,ChiSouthSider43,"Financial Picture - ready to buy a new car?

I am trying to evaluate whether or not I'm ready to buy a new car. I know a car isn't a ""smart"" financial move; that's not what I'm trying to figure out here. More like do I need to have anything else in order before I make this purchase. 

My financial picture:

* 36 years old
* 6-month emergency fund
* $34k invested in 403b
* $20k saved for new car
* $10k in additional savings (outside of EF)
* Gross annual pay: $75,000
* Debt includes $82k mortgage balance and $129k in student loans (I know this number is astronomical. Mistakes were made in my early 20's. Interest has killed me because the original amount of these loans was only about half of this. Good news is I'm a teacher and this balance is about to be forgiven through PSLF. Just waiting on MOHELA to process my last form).
* No other debt
* I feel I'm a little behind in retirement savings, but I'm a single parent and for years I was trying to get on solid financial ground. It's just the last 2-3 years I've gotten on solid ground and been able to contribute a nice chunk to retirement. I'm also a teacher and in addition to the 403b, I will be eligible for a pretty good pension upon retirement.
* Take home pay after taxes, insurance, and 15% to 403b: $1900/paycheck
* I save an additional $400/paycheck to various sinking funds, so net after additional savings is $1,500/paycheck or $3,000/month
* Total monthly bills: $2,200. That's everything - mortgage, food, utilities, gas, car insurance, student loan payment, medication, subscriptions.

Car information:

* I want to buy a new SUV that costs $38k. I plan on doing a $20k down payment (I have been saving for about 5 years). I've been driving my current car for 10 years. It's not necessarily on its last leg, but repairs are starting to get more expensive (just dropped $1900 on it a few months ago).

I've been working on my 2022 tax return (largely to decide if I need to make a Q4 estimated tax payment or if I already paid enough in the first three quarters), and I discovered a funny bug in TurboTax.  I prepared my return in both FreeTaxUSA and TurboTax, and FreeTaxUSA showed a refund that was hundreds of dollars larger.  After going through the forms, I found the difference on line 8 of Form 8959 (Additional Medicare Tax, where household income over a certain threshold is taxed an extra 0.9%).  The value on Form 8959 line 8 comes from Schedule SE line 6, and FreeTaxUSA brought it over just fine, but TurboTax doubled it, resulting in hundreds of dollars more in tax.

As I messed around trying to fix the problem, I eventually figured out that TurboTax has two versions of Schedule SE, which show up as ""Sch SE-T"" and ""Sch SE-S.""  I also figured out that TurboTax uses Sch SE-T for self-employment income that's attributed to the first-named person on a joint return and Sch SE-S for self-employment income attributed to the second-named person (I suspect the ""T"" stands for ""taxpayer"" and the ""S"" stands for ""spouse"").  In any event, when I change my return so the person with the self-employment income is named first (and TurboTax uses Sch SE-T), the error on Form 8959 goes away.  When I change it back, so the person with the self-employment income is named second (and TurboTax uses Sch SE-S), the error reappears.",,,,,

hy976w,cloister-fuck,"What if you stuck to an all-stock retirement portfolio and never held bonds?

Let me preface this by saying I assume I'm wrong / missing something, because everyone seems to know that bonds are an important part of one's portfolio (specifically, they help reduce volatility, and the closer you get to retirement, the more of your portfolio they should make up).  I keep wondering, though, don't bonds reduce volatility at the expense of returns?  Assuming that's right, what if you simply didn't care about volatility (you have nerves of steel or whatever) and had a flexible enough time-horizon that you could wait out any downturn or otherwise minimize sale of stocks that are down?  Bottom-line: Would an all-stock portfolio outperform a portfolio with bonds across the long term?

Even if we imagine a worst-case scenario in which a major downturn coincides with your retirement, wouldn't decades of maxed-out growth help your overall position (again, assuming that's what you'd get by being all in stocks)?  Sure, your portfolio would be down -- maybe way down -- but it'd be down from a higher high, right?  Also, it's not like you're going to liquidate your entire portfolio the day you retire -- you'd only sell enough for that week or month or whatever, so while it sucks to sell low, there'd be plenty other times when you'd get to sell at record highs (assuming a long enough retirement), and wouldn't continuing to max out growth be beneficial during retirement, as well?

I assume people have run simulations on this and concluded that we're better off with bonds (and an increasing amount of bonds as we approach retirement), but it's just never made sense to me.

snrdxc,cloister-fuck,"Employer social security contributions when total income from multiple jobs exceeds the maximum

When total income from multiple jobs exceeds the social security maximum and excess social security tax is withheld, an employee can get the excess refunded at tax time ([https://www.irs.gov/taxtopics/tc608](https://www.irs.gov/taxtopics/tc608)).  How does this work on the employer side, though?  Given a single job, when an employee reaches the social security maximum, both the employee AND the employer stop paying their respective 6.2%, right?  In the case of an employee with multiple jobs, though, do the employers just end up overpaying social security for the employee?  Or do they somehow get their excess payments refunded, too?  Are refunds to employers (if there are any) pro-rated based on how much the employee earned from each employer?

My reason for asking actually has to do with self-employment income in addition to W-2 income.  To make things simple, let's suppose someone earns exactly the social security maximum ($147k for 2022) in W-2 income and another $147k in self-employment/1099 income.  The employee only has to pay social security tax on $147k, but what about the employer side?  Can the entire employer responsibility be put on the W-2 employer and the self-employment/1099 income be taken free of social security tax (thus netting the self-employed individual an additional 6.2%)?

However, would it be wiser to be content with my home because in so close to being mortgage free and just put that money in another place to create another income stream?
Is there anywhere I can put the money to grow but still withdraw it without penalty in say 8-10 years?

Here is my rational as to why I don't buy used and keep it until it scrapes the floor:

1.  I am a female and the thought of getting stranded on the highway or anywhere is terrifying.
2. My husband is the last thing from handy.  So figuring out even the smallest mechanical problem or any kind of maintenance would take a visit to the mechanic.
3. I never lease expensive cars with all the extras.  Just a regular ford that I find comfortable and reliable.
4. We use my car for when we drive on family vacations, so again...like to have something on the newer side for reliability.
5. We live in a city where a car is an absolute must, so it is not a luxury item, but just a part of life.

During this time we also became good friends. (Kids hung out, came to our wedding, we go out to dinner with them, whatever).

Now I'm in the position of considering their offer against my current company.

17ud2hk,code-baby,"Picking Insurance For Next Year

I'm having a bit of a tough time picking what insurance we should get for next year. Some context: My wife will almost certainly max out any limit that she has. She regularly goes to Therapy, PT, and for the last few years she's unfortunately been in and our of the hospital for various things, all of which are out of her control. There's some injections/back issues that are in play for next year too. The rest of the family (me and the kid) are generally very healthy, and don't really go to the doctor that much, mostly just generic preventative type stuff. Obv could change, but that's been the history.

My options are:  
Traditional: $441/month (fam), $1k deductible (personal), $3k deductible (fam), 20% co-insurance for most services, $4k max OOP (personal), $12k max OOP (fam), co-pays are flat fees depending on the service

HDP: $310/month (fam), $2k deductible (personal), $4k deductible (fam), 20% co-insurance for more services, $6k max OOP (personal), $9.1k max OOP (fam), co-pays are 20% for all services, company kicks in $1,200 as a side benefit to the HPHD

The way that I'm thinking about this:

The wife will max out the OOP most likely regardless of the limit. The fam will likely not, but could obv. If the wife maxes her OOP, on the trad we're paying \~9k (440\*12+4000) + whatever the rest of the fam needs. On the HDHP we're paying \~9.7k ($310\*12+6000), less the $1.2k that work kicks in. Also less the tax benefit of the HSA which will max out (or approx $7k \* 25%) so -1.7k in taxes.

Also, if it happens that worst case the whole get super sick, the Traditional plan has 8k in extra OOP that we'd have to cover over the wife's limit, where as with the HDP there's only a max of 3k in extra costs we'd have to cover.

17z8flm,code-baby,"Actual Taxes Paid on Personal Business

How would I figure out how much tax I actually paid on my business income when it's rolled into the total family income on my 1040 tax return?

My wife runs a consulting company and makes \[some amount of money\], and each month we set aside 30% of the pre-tax profits and remit quarterly like good little peons. Then at the end the of the year we file and do all of our normal stuff, inclusive of a Schedule C. But during the year, I'm also making money via my company and we pay taxes on that too. At the end of the year, we either get money back or owe them more money, some portion of that would apply to the business income/taxes part of the family.

But that 30% that I estimated would just be just that. An estimate. What is the real tax paid on my business income?

Assuming it's at the marginal tax rate on top of my pay seems bad because that's assuming that it's all 'after' other money we make. Which isn't really accurate.

Assuming that it's at the effective tax rate that we paid on total income seems plausible, but means that credits/deductions the family got for the year would affect the estimated tax rate. This does however seem like the better of the two methods.

jfhijs,code-baby,"How much should I have invested in my ESPP as a % of my total retirement savings?

Hello everyone,

I've been reading a number of the threads here, and some really good advice, so thanks in advance!

&amp;#x200B;

My wife and I are blessed that we have a (relatively) decent amount of income we are able to put towards retirement savings each month given recent life/job changes, but now we are stuck trying to figure out where to invest the money.

I have an ESPP plan that we (almost) max out each pay period for $450/month (max $600/month), and 401k contributions are \~$1,500 per month (well past the max for the company match point, which nets us another +$600/month).  Thus far we have not sold any of the stock as we feel that the company is on a solid upward trajectory, we were trying to avoid short term capital gains taxes, and because the raw amount was not enough to spend much time thinking about.

Right now, we have \~$5k in company stock (mix of long term and short term at this point), and \~$75k in 401 savings (mostly large cap targeted retirement date funds through Fidelity if it matters).  The primary question is, when does the stock % become too high that I'm too tied to strongly to my companies results?  And/or should I sell some of it an invest it in something else?

Side question that I have (after reading this article [ESPP Contributions)](https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/8oso8o/how_much_should_i_contribute_to_my_employee_stock/), is should I be selling the stock right way and trying to reinvest it in something else?  I understand the relative value of selling it immediately, as I can capture the return on investment and put it somewhere else.  But that feels like it only nets me value if I can invest it into something that would have a higher return than the expected return of the company stock, is that correct?  The $$ profit realized on the stock is something that I would realize in the generalize long term regardless of when sold, so I think it would just be a question of which investment generates the highest likely return (company stock vs other investment)?

Final question, should I be maxxing out the ESPP for the remainder of the $150 per month?  One of the reason that we haven't thus far is for diversifications reasons, but related to my main question, that might not be something that I need to worry about and it might just be a fancy buzz word that misapplying.  The choice to max it out would probably involve putting less towards the 401k contributions, or not making extra payments on the mortgage as right now we're not strongly considering other life style changes to reduce expenses and save more.  (But we might in the future.)

And after typing this and re-reading, I guess one other thought is that we should consider selling the long term options and using those proceeds to max out the new stock purchases and capture a second round of discount/return.  Is that the right way to think about it?

&amp;#x200B;

Edited since I didn't say it specifically before:  I get a 15% discount on the ESPP purchases, and it's discounted from the 'lower of the purchase date or start of period'.

Evening,

I see much advice about having an emergency fund, and it being 3m to 6m worth of expenses, which makes sense for a single person, but how should I adjust that for a 2 income family?

The lady and I operate on the idea that it's very unlikely that both of us will lose our job at the same time (very different industries) and so we are taking the lower of our incomes, assuming that's 'fixed' and then calculating how much we'd need to survive with just that income for 6 months.  Is that reasonable method?

Numbers based example: 1 person makes 70k/year, another makes something higher.  So monthly income if 1 person loses their job is at least 70k\*.70 (taxes) or \~4k/month.  Our semi-committed expenses are \~$5,500 per month.  So our emergency fund is \~$10k.

pg7xsy,code-baby,"I feel like I'm making the right moves, but it's hard to see the long term and how I'll end up in retirement

See above for the cliffs.

(Much) Long version (sorry):

I'm 37, married, with 1 kid.  My wife (34) and I both went back to school later in life, and didn't really have any material income until we were \~34 and 31 respectively, so we were mostly starting at 0 till a few years ago (combined retirement savings of \~25k, combined student loan debt of \~80k, mortgage of 240k, CC debt of \~25k, and family debt of \~10k).

Now we're clearly in a much better place

* Combined income of \~200k per year
* 150k in various retirement accounts
   * 74k in my current company 401k
   * 22k in my previous company 401k
   * 12k in wife's Roth IRA from forever ago (Edward Jones, we're working to close and roll into the new vanguard account)
   * 12k in two new Roth accounts we just opened with Vanguard this year
   * 32k in my current company stock (partially RSUs vesting over 3 years), I max out my ESPP each period, which gives a 15% discount on cheaper of start or end of period price.  I'm willing to hear input on selling the non-RSUs, but honestly, I likely won't, I'm *very* bullish on the company, despite the 'too many eggs in 1 basket' risk
   * 5k in HSA funds
* Emergency fund of \~35k

We contribute 17% of my paycheck to my company's 401k (company kicks in another 6%) so that I max out the 19k yearly limit, plan to contribute 6k/year to each of our Roth IRAs in perpetuity, she is just now eligible for her company 401k, so we'll start contributing \~6% of her income to that (which maxes out the company match), and increase to the 20k limit over the next two or three years as incomes hopefully go up.

We also contribute \~5k total per year to HSAs at both of our companies.

The CC debt is gone (except revolving monthly spending for cash back rewards), the family debt is gone, student loans are down to 55k (and holding while interest is free) mortgage is down to 210k and we're paying it off on a 13 year timeline.

&amp;#x200B;

All of this 'feels' like I'm on the right track, but I find it really hard to get a sense of if we'll be ok in retirement at this rate or not.  Things that throw me for a loop:

* We're 'making' 200k right now, but in no way do we live like we do.
   * Given how much we put towards retirement (which we obviously wouldn't do in retirement)
   * We max out the DCFSA for our kid (thanks gubbament for the free money!) which we won't have in retirement
   * We're aggressively paying off the mortgage which we won't have in retirement
   * We have half baked plans to have another kid in another year or so, and then move into a new house \~2 years after that but rent our current house, and I've no idea how to think about how that will affect the long term plans

&amp;#x200B;

So it's really hard to know are we on track for a similar quality of life, something worse, something better?  If I just ignore the retirement savings, DCFSA, and mortgage, that's almost 50k a year in extra income that we don't 'need' to have the same quality of life.  So is it correct to assume that if we have retirement income of 150k, we'd be in \~the same boat?

Also I have no idea how to think about inflation.  A quick calculation on this site:

[https://smartasset.com/retirement/retirement-calculator](https://smartasset.com/retirement/retirement-calculator)

Suggests that 125k/year in income now may need to be \~225k/year to 'feel' the same.

And maybe as a more important question, what high level things would you recommend that we look into in order to better our situation?

I'm aware of the concept of not trading unsecured debt for secure debt (no one wants to lose their house due to not paying their student loans), but the opportunity to reduce our interest rate is tempting.

We have also considered using a private company to refi the loans into something with a lower interest but most of what I can find is either 4.00%+ or includes fees to refi which feels like throwing away money.  If it matters at all, on our current time table, the student loans will be paid off in \~5.5 or 6 years.

vuko5s,code-baby,"Investing my HSA into Retirement Accounts

I've started to accumulate a non-trivial amount of money into my HSA and we have no need of it basically ever (fingers crossed of course) so we're using it as a retirement savings vehicle.

There's a range of investment options, some seem useless (Us Fixed Income options) but other seem like they are good/bad depending on my investment strategies (International Equity funds, Mid-Cap/Small Cap funds, Large Cap funds), and then a range of target retirement date funds.

Given the size of it (7k, less than 5% of my total retirement investments) I'm thinking about throwing the entire thing into Large Cap specifically VFIAX which appears to be a fund that matches the S&amp;P to the best of it's ability and has a crazy low expense ratio (0.04%).  Thoughts?

w7yva0,code-baby,"Credit cards being closed for inactivity

The wife and I started using 1 joint card 3 or 4 years ago because it's easier and we like the rewards.

Recently a number of our cards have sent us letters saying they will close them due to inactivity. How much should we care about this?
We have no need of the actual credit limits as our primary card limit is vastly (10x) more than any normal monthly spend, but what sort of dent could this in theory put into my/our credit scores?
In my case, the joint card we use is also my longest existing (15+ years) so my length of credit likely isn't impacted.
In her case, some of them might be her longest cards but she's a registered (authorized) user on my card so that same history should show for her history.

Another recent post here got me thinking:

Should I be using iBonds as a part of my emergency fund?

Pros:

Interest rate is vastly superior to what I'm getting in any sort of savings/HYSA

Cons:

Can't sell it for the first year

Will lose 3 months of interest if you sell before 5 years

Clearly it's just a question of risk management and trading liquidity for returns, but what % of your emergency fund would you consider 'reasonable' or 'safe' to have invested in iBonds?

xf7ad9,code-baby,"Selling Company ESPP Stock, Sell Recent Stock or Older Stock

As the title implies, I don't know what the best bet is from a long term standpoint.

My newer stock (in the last year or two) has an average appreciation of \~30%, and would be taxed as short term capital gains on the profits. But my net cash in hand would be higher since gains are notable less (higher basis) and thus less taxes.

The older stock (older than 2 years) has an average appreciation of \~200%, but would be taxed at more favorable rates.

So it mostly comes down to a question of should I recognize the gain now and pay the taxes now or wait till later? One factor that I'm considering is that in future years we will likely go over the Roth ITA contribution limit, so we might better off selling now and recognizing the income so that if we sell in future years we don't price our self out of that option.

The goal here is to re-invest, so it's not specifically a cash flow question (i.e. not trying to go buy a car or house or anything).

xp454v,code-baby,"Parsing Store Receipts Easily to Subdivide Spend at Mega Stores

The wife and I are setting some new goals to travel more and do more fun stuff, while still living inside our means. One area that we think that we have a ton of opportunity is our 'grocery' spending. This generally includes anything that we'd buy at a grocery store including places like Wally World.

So from a practical standpoint, this would include actual groceries, beer, special foods (fancy cheeses, meats) health and beauty stuff (makeup, vitamins), baby stuff (food mostly) and household stuff (cleaners, bug spray, small kitchen stuff). Ideally we'd subdivide that into some other groups to have a better sense of where the money is going and where we have room to cut back.

Purchasing it in 2, 3, 4+ different transactions when we're there seems tedious as best, and painful/useless at worse. Reading back through the receipts seems terrible.

I have to answer some questions online before I'm approved. Some of the questions are : 

**Do you currently** have any disorder, condition, or disease or are you currently taking prescription medication for any disorder, condition, or disease (other than: allergies; cold; or cough)? 

(i'm prescribed adderall- not for adhd but for an off-label purpose). 

 **In the last five years** have you been diagnosed with, treated for, had any symptoms of, or been in a hospital or other facility for any of the following?

* Chest pain, heart disease or disorder, high blood pressure;
* Cancer, tumors;
* Respiratory disease or disorder of the lungs;
* Multiple sclerosis, epilepsy, seizure, stroke;
* Kidney, liver or pancreas disease or disorder;
* Diabetes;
* Mental or nervous disorder;
* Alcoholism, drug addiction;
* Chronic pain, rheumatoid arthritis, lupus; or
* Colitis, Crohn's disease, gastric bypass.  


(I went to a cardiologist over a year ago for mild intermittent chest pain I was getting. We did a stress test and an echocardiogram and both came back negative. My blood pressure also gets elevated while I'm working- probably from stress and drinking too much coffee since I work nights and also the adderall. It's normal when at rest and not stressed but I asked for a blood pressure medication anyway since most of the time I am stressed and running around. 

 **In the last five years,** have you been diagnosed with or treated by a medical or other practitioner for neurological disease or disorder or musculoskeletal disease or disorder or **are you currently pregnant?**

I'm not sure how I should answer here. Will they look into my records if I ever happen to file a claim? If they find out I lied, will I get denied based on that?

Nationwide protests have cast a spotlight on racism and inequality in the United States. Now a major bank has put a price tag on how much the economy has lost as a result of discrimination against African Americans: $16 trillion.

Since 2000, U.S. gross domestic product lost that much as a result of discriminatory practices in a range of areas, including in education and access to business loans, according to [a new study](https://ir.citi.com/NvIUklHPilz14Hwd3oxqZBLMn1_XPqo5FrxsZD0x6hhil84ZxaxEuJUWmak51UHvYk75VKeHCMI%3D) by Citigroup. It's not an insignificant number: By comparison, [U.S. GDP](https://www.bea.gov/news/2020/gross-domestic-product-2nd-quarter-2020-second-estimate-corporate-profits-2nd-quarter) totaled $19.5 trillion last year.

And not acting to reverse discriminatory practices will continue to exact a cost. Citigroup estimates the economy would see a $5 trillion boost over the next five years if the U.S. were to tackle key areas of discrimination against African Americans.

""We believe we have a responsibility to address current events and to frame them with an economic lens in order to highlight the real costs of longstanding discrimination against minority groups, especially against Black people and particularly in the U.S.,"" wrote Raymond J. McGuire, a vice chairman at the bank and the chairman of its banking, capital markets and advisory team.

Wall Street itself has also faced accusations for years of discriminatory practices against African Americans, such as limiting approval for mortgages or not providing enough banking options in minority neighborhoods, which are among the damaging actions identified by Citigroup researchers.

Specifically, the study came up with $16 trillion in lost GDP by noting four key racial gaps between African Americans and whites:

* $13 trillion lost in potential business revenue because of discriminatory lending to African American entrepreneurs, with an estimated 6.1 million jobs not generated as a result
* $2.7 trillion in income lost because of disparities in wages suffered by African Americans
* $218 billion lost over the past two decades because of discrimination in providing housing credit
* And $90 billion to $113 billion in lifetime income lost from discrimination in accessing higher education

As a result, Citigroup urges a slew of actions to reverse discriminatory practices and boost GDP over the next five years, including addressing the wage gap suffered by African Americans and promoting diversity at the top within banks and companies.

Citigroup's recommendations aren't new: Various studies have shown similar findings, and experts have called for similar action for years, though so far progress has been slow.",,,,,

The ER doc asked me if I wanted plastics to stitch up my nose. I'm 28 years old so of course I said yes as I didn't want horrible scarring. As soon as the plastic surgeon walked up to my stretcher, the first thing I said was ""are you in-network?"" ""I work here at the hospital and have the employee insurance"". He assured me he was and not to worry.

6 months later I get the $30,000 bill. Insurance cut me an out-of-network benefit check for \~$3,000 which I gave to the provider. Provider still wants the other \~$27,000. Someone showed me a link to this thing where you can sign and send copies to your insurance and provider and apparently, I guess it absolves you of responsibility? I already tried appealing insurance for more money, it was denied.

shto38,CoffeeQID,"Backdoor Roth- would it complicate things if I DCA'd throughout the year and have multiple conversions?

I can either do a lump sum $6000 contribution but it technically wouldn't be lump sum as I would have to save up a bit and hold cash for a few months before I had enough money to do this. Or I could have say 6 contributions of $1000 each throughout the year but that would mean I would be doing 6 conversions instead of one. This is my first year doing the backdoor so I don't know if that would complicate things come tax time or does it not change anything? Thanks.

Basically is it easier, paperwork wise, to hold cash until I have $6000 ready to deploy or should I just DCA in as much as I can afford throughout the year and get that money into the market immediately until I eventually max it out?",,,,,
staf4w,CoffeeQID,"Insurance is giving me a check for ~$5000 to give to out of network doctor. Question?

Couple years ago I broke my nose, got some stitches in the ER from the plastic surgeon. Got a bill for like $30,000 6 months later because he ended up being out of network. My insurance cut me a check for $3000 which I gave him. After 2 years of staving off payment, going through the IDR process through NY state, I've gotten the bill lowered to $5000. I've taken the new lowered bill to my insurance and they've agreed to cut me another check for the full remaining amount. The billing office mentioned I could pay it off via monthly installment. Wondering if I could hide the fact that my insurance is cutting me a new check and instead, offer to pay it off in say $100 monthly installments. While I then take the $5000 check and buy some I-bonds with it so I can get some kind of return on it.",,,,,
t5obue,CoffeeQID,"Super confused on backdoor Roth conversion I performed in 2022 for year 2021.

I contributed $6000 to a Roth IRA for 2021. I ended up making too much money by the end of the year. In January 2022, I contacted Schwab and they performed the backdoor conversion over the phone with me. They had me create a traditional IRA. They transferred funds from the Roth to the traditional, and then performed the conversion back to the Roth. They said I would owe only a couple hundred dollars in taxes and would need to fill out a tax form (8606 I think?). I am checking my tax forms in my Schwab account and I have a 1099 for my brokerage, and a ""year end gain loss reporting 2021"" for my Roth IRA. I don't see any 8606 form. I'm just really confused on what forms I need to give to my accountant.

Since this conversion was technically done in 2022 (but for the year 2021) does that mean I don't have to worry about this until tax season next year? In other words, are the taxes owed for 2022 or 2021?",,,,,

u7crs8,Compositeman1313,"Should you budget to die with money?

Pretty much what the title says and I guess this is more philosophical than a financial question but when we do eventually retire and itch closer and closer to death (think being around 70-80 something), should we keep money in our investments and the bank still at that point? I mean we retire because working becomes more annoying than the money is worth, otherwise we'd keep working all our lives. So my question is at what point in your life is the money still worthwhile to you and at what point does that turn and it's value depreciates in your mind. Now, I understand hoarding some in your old age if you have a family and needs to be tended to after death but I don't have any kids and the only person I plan on having to be cared for after my death would be pets (whom I would leave to my younger brother). Henceforth, wouldn't it make sense to at some point just cash out your remaining investments and have some fun with them? I know of course, this might sound dumb because you don't know when you'll actually die but assuming you keep easily enough to keep your housing, food, and medical bills in order for the rest of your life, then wouldn't throwing out the last remaining bits on people and experiences you enjoy make sense? I wouldn't necessarily spend it on materialistic items seeing as those will simply be gone when you die but the rest could leave a lasting impact or even help others. I just keep thinking about this because in Sweden, they do ""death cleaning"" when they're approaching their elderly age in which they throw away or give away materialistic items so their inheritors don't have to go through it all and determine what to do with it all. So, shouldn't or couldn't the same be applied to money?

At my previous job, I was given a suped up M1 Macbook Pro since my job was very coding heavy, and was allowed to use it for personal use. I fell in love with the MacBook and its OS and haven't looked back.

I am starting in M.S. program in data science soon, run a side business online, and am also planning on doing various coding projects as well for my portfolio, as well as day to day personal use.

I would use the laptop until the day it dies, and all of my accessories are meant for apple products (keyboard, mouse, docking station). I'm also that guy and have an iphone, airpods, and apple watch, which are all synced to the Mac. Also size is very important to me since I don't have great eyes so I would shell out for a 16 inch.

I have it down to two plans, and I want peoples thoughts on what is the better option for me.

I'm only using my base pay for my budget since my bonuses are one time payments that I'll use to save for one time things like a house, grad school, wedding, honeymoon, etc. but that'll be roughly $57k pre tax

**Plan 1:**

Take home pay from work is $5000 but I contribute 10% to my 401K

10upbic,CoookieHo,"What should my net monthly savings be to feel comfortable?

I will be starting a new job, where I will be making considerably more than my new job but the take home will be less because I will investing my money a whole lot more and my COL is also going up.

Currently I make $60k from work and about $25K from my side hustle. I only invest 8% into my 401K and nothing else. I have no money invested into a Roth IRA or HSA or stocks. On a normal month, after monthly expenses including rent, my take home is roughly $3k.

With my new job, I will be making $92.7K base, $18K annual bonus, and $39K performance bonus. I also make about $22k from a side hustle. My work is also giving me $625 per month pre tax for a car allowance if I buy a car 5 years or newer so I'm going to take advantage of that plan. I'm only using my base pay for my budget since my bonuses are one time payments. 

After heavily studying the flowchart on this subreddit, here's the best monthly budget plan I came up with:

**Take home pay (including car allowance) after contributing 15% to my 401K: $5240**

**Total take home including side hustle is \~$7090**

Rent &amp; Utilities: $1650

Car payment, insurance, parking and gas: $975

Eating out and Groceries: $600

Gym and medicine: $90

Fun money and subscriptions(only $50): $350

Roth IRA or stocks (I'm having trouble picking which one): $500

Sending Money to Parents: $200

**In all, my total monthly expenditure: \~$4360**

**Net savings: $2730**

I'll use my bonus money to max out my HSA at the end of every year, and I'll make around $40k post tax from all my bonuses.

Regardless, considering how much I'm making, I feel like I'm not putting enough into my savings every month to feel comfortable. I have $40k in my checking right now as my emergency fund, and to save for a house, wedding, etc.

I know the general rule of thumb is to invest 30-35% of your pre tax income, but taking into account only my W-2, I'm only investing 21%. I would not feel comfortable at all with my monthly net savings if I invested 30%.

This all being said, I was wondering if my net monthly savings is enough for me to feel secure or if I should be saving more monthly, and any other advice?

For the next year or two, I need to be very cash fluid since I will be getting engaged and married and starting an expensive grad program.

I (23) am a recent college graduate who wants to maximize my savings in long and short term, but am not very financially literate so I was hoping for some advice.

Background:

I recently started a job with a salary of 60K, and i am assuming that I will get raises and promotions in the future, along with a supplemental income. i put in 8% into my 401K and my company matches 3%. The max my company will match is 37.5% up to 8% of my compensation. How that works is if I were to contribute 8% of my compensation, my company will match 37.5% of that amount. Any additional contribution will not be matched. 37.5% of 8% is a 3% match. I know i should be putting in more than 8% but I am currently cash poor right now due to some personal emergencies. After taxes, 401K, health, etc. i bring home around $4500, including supplemental income. My expenses are roughly $1700/month. I will have a savings of about $14500 (after paying for all my emergencies) at the end of this month and have about $2000 in my 401k which I have not invested into anything (I would like to invest it but have no idea where to start). I have school debt of $21k of which i will start paying $200/month starting next month (unless you guys have a better suggestion. I am moving across the country in July and my moving expenses will be about $1500.

I have major financial anxiety and want to do what I can to maximize how much money i make in the short term and long term. I know it's a vague question but any advice will be appreciated!",,,,,
ul57pi,CoookieHo,"When to buy a car (new or used)

Hi, hope yâ€™all are well! I am 23 with a 2007 Toyota Tundra with 190k miles. I bought the car two years ago and paid for it at once because I was saving up for it. Due to some bad luck and a stolen catalytic converter, Iâ€™ve had to pay an extra 7.5k. I have no payments on the car at all, but I am moving to a very busy city soon and was thinking about eventually getting a new or used electric car. The thing is, so many articles Iâ€™ve read on here say to never buy a new or used car if you have a car paid offâ€¦so that begs the question, when would be a could time for me to actually get a newer car?",,,,,
w3t3p0,CoookieHo,"When should I contribute 15% to my 401k?

I (23 years old) currently work as an engineer for a software company making 60k. After taxes, healthcare and 401k, I make $1723 in Chicago. I am currently contributing 8% to my 401k. From side hustles and my paychecks, I make between $4.5k-5k a month net. I recently moved from Texas to Chicago so these state income taxes are a pain, and moving was costly, albeit a one time thing. My monthly expenses, including rent and utilities, are between $1.5k-2k. I am up for a promotion at the end of the year, and if I go at the pace I am going, I should be making at least $100k within 2-4 years. I know the rule of thumb is to contribute 15% of your paycheck to your 401k, but with the economic climate and chance for emergencies, I just feel like 8% contribution to my 401k at my current salary is enough. My company matches 37.5% up to 8% of my compensation. I'm considering possibly contributing 10% once I get promoted. I was wondering if this current contribution amount and then finally contributing 15% once I hit 100k seems like a good game plan? I do plan on contributing 6k to a Roth IRA sometime before the tax year ends, and then contributing the max to it annually.",,,,,

Currently, the company doesn't offer stock options, bonuses or education assistance but i've heard the new regime is working towards possibly trying to implement that for its employees. I enjoy being an engineer, but specifically in a company in the tech industry. Should I wait to see if the changes I mentioned are implemented within the next year or so? Or should I look into other opportunities.

wm3u1z,CoookieHo,"How much spending is too much?

Edit: Included my investment budget

I (23) grew up very poor and was broke for the entirety of college. I graduated last year and have a job where I make 60k and I make 15k yearly in side hustles. After taxes and contributions, etc. I bring home about $5k. I currently have $25k in my bank account. 
My monthly expenses are:
Rent, Utilities, Phone, internet - $900

Groceries and eating out - $300
Car Insurance - $100
Entertainment/Subscription - $100

I have student loans and plan to pay $500/month but Iâ€™m waiting to see what the ruling on student loans is.

My investing budget is as shown:
Currently I invest 10% into my 401k and my company matches 3% up to 8%. I'm due for a raise and promotion at the end of the year, so I plan on contributing 15% when that happens. In addition, I'm planning on starting and maxing out a Roth IRA before the tax year ends.

Including student loans, my monthly expenses come out to be about $2k, leaving $3k in savings every month. However, Iâ€™m very frugal and always too scared to spend additional money. Iâ€™m always afraid of going broke since thatâ€™s how I grew up most of my life, and Iâ€™m still not used to having money. That being said, Iâ€™d like to not live with the idea of being scared of going broke over my head and Iâ€™d like to be able to spend money on things that arenâ€™t just necessities, but I have no idea what would be a responsible amount of money to set aside as â€œenjoyment moneyâ€.

UPDATE 2: I was very honest with my boss and he was very honest with me that my new salary is life changing and unfortunately there was no way he would be allowed to come close to my new salary. It was very amicable and understanding. That being said, I took the new job. I plan on keeping up my software skills and who knows, maybe I'll end up being back in software somehow. That being said, I'm super excited for the new job and all the new experiences it'll bring.

Update: Thank you all for your input! This blew up so much more than i thought it would. I haven't made a decision but I definitely have a lot more factors to keep in mind. One thing I forgot to mention is that this new job wouldn't start until Feb 2023 .

Update 2: I want to also clarify that this is a Technical Sales Engineering role, so while it does involve sales, it is sales-adjacent.

I (23 almost 24, one year out of college) work as a level 1 data engineer at a software company (1000+ employees) making $60k. I realized that I am underpaid for my position. Normally I'd leave immediately but I have a kickass manager who I would follow to the ends of the earth. I have also applied for other data engineering positions, but all interviewers said they were looking for experienced coders.

My boss has promised me that I will be promoted to level 2 in January, he was actually going to submit the paperwork this month but HR told him it was too late in the year to submit promotional paperwork...The issue is that he also doesn't know how much of a raise I will receive when I am promoted because HR is keeping finances hidden from him as well. Every attempt I have made to get HR to give me an inkling of financial expectations has lead nowhere. This frustration led me to apply for a Technical Sales Engineering job, which I surprisingly got. Money wise, I would be paid 2.5 times my current engineering salary (new salary would be 150k). The issue is that the job would take me out of the software game since it's an electronics company. I want to give my current company a fair shot solely because of my boss and I also want to stay in software, so any advice on how to get HR to tell me what my salary expectations will be? That way I can counter and see what I can get from my promotion before I have to give the job offer an answer by its deadline.

Not sure whether theyâ€™ll perform a â€œtrueupâ€ as one commenter mentioned later on, guess Iâ€™ll see.

Original post:

My employer matches 25% of the first 6% and I make ~120k a year. I was eligible to start contributing to the 401k starting in July, but I did not actually start putting money in until October because of clerical errors on my HRâ€™s end (the HR department is one person, and it has been really difficult to get any clear information or help from them in general). I set my contributions super high to try to offset this (like 40% of my income) and get a decent amount contributed for 2021. I have contributed 12k at this point, well over 6% of my yearly salary.

Shouldnâ€™t my employer match be ~$1800 now? Because currently it says only $418.

edit - should probably have said â€œtaxable accountâ€ not brokerage^

For about a year I did not have access to a 401k through my job - I already maxed my IRA and HSA, so I saved about 10k in a brokerage account.

At the time I didnâ€™t know much about taxes, so I put it in Vanguardâ€™s target date fund (2060). However Iâ€™ve now heard that those specific funds are terrible for taxed accounts.

esfpn0,CraigM120,"Should I hold off on investing for the next 5 months to pay off my SL?

Here's some quick info: 29 year old single male, make about $80000 in a union trade., currently in my second year of apprenticeship. I currently have an Emergency fund of $11,000 (which covers 6 months of expenses, something I really don't want to touch). I'm currently paying $500/month (min. payment is $259) towards my student loans, which has an interest rate of 7.14% and a balance of $9784. I'm also contributing 15% of my paycheck (about $240/week) towards a 401k. Through my employer i also have an annuity (balance of $25,000, this is based on the hours I work) and a pension (balance of $34,000). 

&amp;#x200B;

If i continue to pay $500 a month it would take me about 21 months to pay off my SL entirely. I am thinking of stopping my 401k contribution for the next few months and throwing everything towards my SL. This would make it about a $1400/month payment and I would be able to pay it off in about 7 months. I also sporadically throw a few hundred at my SL when i save more during the month which could make it about 5 or 6 months. Once these are paid off I would immediately start contribution 20% of my paycheck (about $315) back into my 401k to kick start that again.

&amp;#x200B;

My question is whether this would hurt me a little in the long term? Obviously we're only taking half a year but that could be about $4000 that i lose in contributing to my 401k. However since my SL would be paid off id get an immediate 7.14% return on my money. Any feedback would be greatly appreciated!",,,,,

30 year old male, single, no kids, making about $75,000 in a good union trade. Unfortunately right now I am furloughed from work however I should be back by at least June, but you never know. I currently have an E. Fund of $15,000 (which is about 6-7 months of expenses), which I really like especially since i'm furloughed right now (i am collecting unemployment right now).  I currently have a balance of about $8000 with a rate of 7.14% (yes i know that's high). Currently I'm paying $400/month. I'm thinking of two options:

Option A - Keep the $15,000 in my E. Fund, throw all excess money after bills throughout the next few months and have my loan paid off by September/October (would be paying about 1700-2000/month).

Option B - Pay off the Student Loans now and have that done with. My E-fund would be down to $7,000 but I could save the money I'd use towards the loan and get that E-fund back to $15,000. Obvisouly the big draw to this is I'd be done with my student loans and my only other debt would be my car.

if2nw7,CuriousernCurioser,"How to choose a financial advisor/planner.

If you want to do it yourself thatâ€™s fine. If youâ€™d prefer to hire a professional these are the 3 questions to ask. 

1) Are you a CFP? 

CFPs are the cream of the crop in the industry. They go through more extensive education and training and have experience requirements that donâ€™t exist for your average advisor. 

2) Do you charge fees or commissions?

You want to eliminate the conflicts of interest between you and your planner as best as possible. Commissions for trades are the worst compensation structure because they are getting paid regardless of the advice they give. Flat monthly fees are best because the advisor is now being compensated for the advice they give and not just the investments. Fee based and and Fee for assets model are the most common and fine as long as the advisor is worth the advice they are giving. Many of the best planners charge a fee for assets under management because itâ€™s the most lucrative business model and they have no trouble keeping and acquiring happy clients. 

3) What if I wanted to buy a stock?

You donâ€™t want an old school stock picking broker who hasnâ€™t kept up with the times. The evidence is clear that index funds are better than most mutual funds and picking stocks. The advisor should reply with some form of, â€œyou can do whatever youâ€™d like with your money, but if we are going to work together I do whatâ€™s been proven to maximize your chances of success in the long term, and that means I donâ€™t pick stocks and I donâ€™t try and time the marketsâ€. This may seem harsh but if they are willing to let you do it then they have one foot in the old school and a good sign theyâ€™re not truly objective. 

* if you find yourself in some niche like government employee, doctor, dentist, retiree, employee stock options, and can find yourself a specialist who only works with these people and wonâ€™t take on others, this is ideal. Specialists are more valuable in finance for the same reason you want someone who does hips all day to replace yours as opposed to a general orthopedist.

Hello,

I may have screwed myself over and may need your help. I work in healthcare and have a main job but I also have a lot of per diem jobs I pick up on the side. (I know I'm going to regret this because I will be waiting for 5 W2's this upcoming January).

My main job will be well over six figures with the appropriate federal and state tax withholding. However, my other pay stubs, because they're small, doesn't reflect the correct amount of federal or state tax withholding (they're sometimes a couple of dollars).

What can I do now that I'm close to the end of the year to ensure that I don't owe money? Should I just quit my side jobs in total? I've made a bout an extra $6-$7,000 throughout the year which was probably only taxed max $1,000 now that I'm looking at old pay stubs. My partner mentioned I put some money into a Traditional IRA.

Other than that, why are life insurance policies like Mutual of Omaha not really worth it? By my math she can just put aside $50 a month and have that money saved up in 16 years. Hoping she lives til/past 81.

I think I'm just going to lay it on her that she needs the money and that this is dumb but any additional support in the actual policy would be helpful too.

I am not the guarantor but the poorer person looking for assistance securing an apartment. I am 33 and disabled living with my mom but work 10 hours a week and make roughly $2,100 a month total half of that is not taxed because it's ssdi. 1/3 of that is $700. I live in Cook County so everything anywhere near here is above that even if just barely. My credit is fine.

My best friend makes like 150k a year but is looking to purchase a home in the nearish future as he lives in an apartment himself with his girlfriend.

I haven't asked him yet but I know he doesn't want to do anything that will hurt his chances of securing a mortgage or getting a house. From what I gather from googling, would it only be a credit check for him in which he may lose a few points from his score?

I didn't want to just trust Google before proposing to him so I came here.

I know they have websites that will be the guarantor for you but they would likely require a month's rent extra.

Thanks for the advice! And before suggesting not to do it over the friendship, I would never screw him over. Even though things are tight I would probably even make sure I always have the money available in case something happens and be sure he always has a live check so he can access it.",,,,,

I know little about life insurance and I doubt it can be beneficial in my mom's situation but I would like to explore any options.

My dad just turned 66 and is in a nursing home since Jan and my mom is 66 as well. His health has really deteriorated as of late. I know these policies have a 2-3 year wait period, that much I know. I don't 'think' he's going to die that soon.

She gets both of their social securities as they make under $2,7xx combined and it's enough for her to live on. If he dies she's screwed. Now I don't know that life insurance is a solution. Maybe it can keep her afloat a little bit, I don't know. You tell me. I know she would get his higher $1,8xx if he passes but that's still not enough by itself.

He is diagnosed with dementia and a lack of motivation to move and a fall that broke his hip has him permanently in a wheelchair. He went into septic shock and because of that is permanently on a catheter. He gave up smoking after 50 years maybe 1.5 years ago due to a lack of motivation to go outside but I know that's probably too recently. He's still very alert and oriented as he was just moved from the ""dementia floor"" to a ""regular"" floor. Sorry if that's not politically correct but that's how it was explained to me.

Is there any merit looking into this anymore? Or does anyone have any other suggestions? She wants to keep the house at all costs.

My wife 38F) and I (33M) have been saving up for a down payment in SoCal (LA county). We currently have about 95K saved, and my original goal was to save 140K. I am planning on putting down 10% (assuming no more than a 600k home), having between 10-15k for immediate repairs, and another 15K for closing costs. Then with the remaining 50k make a principal payment to reduce the size of the loan. 

Question: With the extra 50k saved, should I apply a principle payment, or put it in my brokerage account (fskax) and let it grow, thus giving me options with the money in about 20 years or so (I.e pay off home sooner, FIRE, etc)

Extra details:
We gross 132K right now, will go up to 135 starting July 1. We have no debt, 8 months of EF savings, investing 24% of gross income towards retirement between 2 pensions, 2 Roth IRAs and my 403B.

Hey everyone, happy Friday. Iâ€™ve been thinking about this for a couple of weeks now and hoping to get a discussion going about this idea I have,  partially inspired by The Money Guy show. Iâ€™m not risk adverse, but more along the lines of covering my bases â€œjust in caseâ€. 

First tier is the emergency fund (9 months) which is strictly an â€œincome replacement fundâ€ if either my wife or I lost our jobs. 2 months is in a separate bank, the rest in a HYSA. 

Second tier is having our deductibles saved up (renters, car, and earthquake, total is about 6K), currently in I Bonds but can be redeemed at any time (bought in November 2021). 

Third tier is having our max out of pocket medical expenses saved (3K for both) in the same HYSA, but different bucket. 

The emergency fund is 9 months bc weâ€™re hoping to buy a home in 2025 or 2026 and have been trying to start a family, so I know instead of being 9 months it will probably go down to 3-4 months depending on how much our expenses rise. 

What are your thoughts about this 3 part emergency fund? Not sure if Iâ€™m being too cautious or if others have a similar thought process about this. Curious to get your thoughts about it.",,,,,

I'd like some more information before I decide to change to an HSA. I'd like to use an HSA for any potential needed care when I'm a senior citizen if needed.

Background info:

32, Third-year Teacher in CA. No health issues. I Will be married next year. Due to being in CA, I know I will get taxed by the state. I have several questions. Currently, have PPO through Anthem, and this year have gotten a cleaning at the dentist and an annual physical. Scheduled for wisdom teeth removal in late December, after the enrollment period ends.

Questions:

\-I have a Roth IRA through Fidelity, and they offer an HSA. Would I be able to open one through Fidelity even though my work offers one? If so, how would that work? Any tax implications for doing so?

\-If I can open an HSA through Fidelity, would I invest the money as I do with the Roth (i.e. Target Date Funds)?

\-Did having to pay state taxes for contributions and earnings (and potential capital gains) cause you to not choose an HSA if offered?

\-As far as the wisdom teeth removal surgery, I assume I would be responsible for paying the entire cost of that until the deductible is met; I can then reimburse myself at some point in the future for that surgery?

\-Anything else I should be aware of?

However, I have been reading more about sinking funds, and I'm a little confused by a couple of things. 

Firstly, I understand that sinking funds are for things like car repairs, annual car fees, Xmas gifts, etc. How many sinking funds should someone have? What are some of your sinking funds?  I think I get overwhelmed by seeing many different categories, and so I get anxious about funding them all. How long does it take you to get to your goal for each one?

For any homeowners, I also know you should have 1% of home value for repair or maintenance each year; if you know you will need a new roof for example, do you make that part of the yearly repair fund or a whole separate fund? How far in advance do you contribute to a sinking fund if you think you will need a new roof in a few years? I'm hoping to buy a home within 2 years and looking to be prepared for any surprises. 

Another question is if you have all of these sinking funds, at what point does an emergency fund actually get used for an emergency?

I really like Vanguard and they manage a lot of my money.  Their advisors are great but their recommendations are limited to what products Vanguard offers.  Likewise, I've gone to supposedly independent CFP's and that typically ends with a really annoying, and usually unhelpful sales pitch for the life insurance they happen to sell.

The old guys in this business are usually opposed to crypto.  

Less common investments are usually discouraged because they don't know much about them.

Come retirement, do retired people regret having too much in Traditional 401K/IRA's?

There's just so much we can't predict about retirement, particularly our health and life expectancy.  Skilled nursing/assisted living when I'm old enough to retire will likely cost well over $100K per year.  My house will be much older and needing substantial repairs and upgrades.

We have an appointment with an estate planning attorney tomorrow.  I'm curious what the rest of you think about this...

One of the questions for us is whether we want to stagger the distribution of assets to our children when they turn 25, 30, 35.  

I'm almost 40 years old with a 1-year old kid.  The successors we'd like to use at this point are all in my age bracket or much older.  If my wife and I dropped dead tomorrow, 2 of the 4 people on the list will, for sure, die from old age by the time our kid turns 35.  In other words, they won't be alive to carry out the distribution to our kid.  The younger successors on our list would be in their 70's and could be deceased as well.  Or not of sound mind.

I understand what this provision is trying to accomplish, but it seems like a nightmare for the kids inheriting the money because it stretches the successor responsibilities so far into the future, and potentially puts the assets at risk.

I'm looking to max out my HSA for 2023. There are quite a few factors at play. I had two different HSAs with different companies. 

First, I had a HDHP from 5/31/2023 to 9/1/2023. My total contributions during this time was $1,282.40. I was on the individual plan. 

Then, now I have a HDHP starting 10/1/2023. This time on the family plan so my max contribution goes up to $7,750. There are 4 remaining pay periods for 2023 (I get paid on the 7th and the 22nd). Is this how it works or can I contribute up until tax day of 2024? 

I believe the IRS considers you eligible for the entire month as long as you were covered on the first day of the month. Prorated max contribution considered... So I had 4 months of eligibility on the first HDHP and 3 months remaining of eligibility for the second HDHP. My total max contribution for this year is $4,520.83 minus what I already contributed $1,282.40 = $3,238.43 divided by number of paychecks left (4).

Iâ€™m going through the Bank of America first-time homebuyer program that pays $7,500 in closing costs and 3% of the down payment ($15,000 covered by them if my home was $300,000, nothing additional is required).

*All the calculations are based on a $2,000 mortgage.*

Income:

Gross: $67,800 yearly $5,688 monthly $2,844 bi-weekly

Net: $52,338 yearly $4,362 monthly $2,180 bi-weekly

Projected rental income (found tenant, ready to sign lease): $10,800 yearly $900 monthly

Current debt-to-income ratio (w/ mortgage included): 41%

Current debt-to-income ratio (w/ mortgage &amp; rental income included): 36%

Emergency fund (cash reserves only, not including payment for closing costs &amp; down payment): \~$12,000

% of net income spent on housing: 46

% of gross spent on housing: 35

% of net spent on housingÂ (w/ rental income): 40

% of gross spent on housingÂ (w/rental income): 31

**Rules of Thumb**

*No more than 30% of your gross monthly income should be spent on housing:*

A $2,000 mortgage puts me at 35%, but with the rental income itâ€™s 31%.

*Your mortgage payment shouldn't put you more than 36% DTI:*

A $2,000 mortgage puts me at 41% DTI, but with rental income itâ€™s 36%.

*The 4x rule (if you spend less than 20% of your current take-home income on debt):*

I currently spend less than 5% of my income on existing debts, so the 4x rule gives me a purchase price of \~$270,000 with no HOA dues. This is currently the price target Iâ€™m aiming for. So although these calculations are based on a $2,000 mortgage from a \~$300,000 purchase price, it will more likely be a $1,800-$1,900 mortgage.

*Emergency fund for household expenses to last at least 6 months:*

Stashing away $2,500 for 6 months puts me at $15,000, but by the time I officially close and have to start paying the loan I should be around there.

**Factors to consider:**

* My girlfriend will live with me, and her income was left out of the loan approval process purposefully to ensure we do not overextend ourselves. My current thoughts are that weâ€™ll just split the mortgage from whatâ€™s left over from the other tenant. Weâ€™ll be paying around $550 each with the current calculations.
* I would need to lose my job and BOTH of my roommates in order for me to be truly swamped. In this case, I could sell my \~$20,000 car and live off my current cash reserves to give me time to find another job or sell the house.
* I shouldn't rely on this but my quoted \~5% interest rate leaves room for improvement, so I could refinance down the line and save money.
* The tenant is only signing a lease for a year, so the rental income is not guaranteed for the life of the loan but hopefully my income will increase in 2 or 3 years to a point where I can cover their portion eventually or find another tenant. 

Are there any flaws in this way of thinking? Any other rules of thumb I should use?Â

Here's the rundown.

My current job is with a very solid company. I am fully remote. They offer a retirement benefit of 10% (no match required, fully vested instantly), we work 7.5 hour workdays, admin staff is talking about adding amazing flexibilities like random 'wellness' days, I love my team, and I am very independent which I like, very flexible work schedules, 30 total days of leave (sick, vacation, and bereavement). My salary is currently around $68,000, but we do market research every year to make sure we are keeping up with inflation. Last year it was an 18% increase. That was for being within the top 60% of our industry. This year we are doing top 70% of the industry, but I do not expect it to be as high as 18%. I expect the 5-10% range starting Jan. 1st. I also recently got promoted, so I wouldn't be eligible for another raise for at least another two years.

The new job just offered me $80,000. They have a Cash Balance Retirement account where the company contributes 4 percent of your annual pay and bonus but this doesn't vest until 3 years of service. For the 401k, they match â€œdollar for dollarâ€ up to the first 3 percent you contribute. They then match 50 cents on the dollar for the next 2 percent. You are immediately vested and are free to take the company match with you if you decide to leave the company (no waiting period). Four and a half weeks of leave plus 5 days of bereavement. It would be a hybrid model (I could probably negotiate a remote role) coming into the office once in awhile on Mondays. I live 5 mins from the office. They give a $50 stipend every month for Internet, gym membership, or anything that I could use. There's probably more benefits but those are the most important ones to me.

I was in a rehab facility January and February last year after surgery.  I would say every other person in the facility was medicaid/medicare.  More on that in a second.

Thanksgiving week I received a bill that the facility hand wrote my forward to address on from a pharmacy out of state.  It was literally an invoice with my name on it, a due date back in August, and a bottom line amount due for a few hundred dollars.  Not a single indication of what the bill was for, when, etc.  I called the 800 number and they told me they would reprint the bill and send it to me.  I gave them my correct address.  The week after Christmas, I got another hand written forward of the exact same bill.  No changes, no updates, except the bill now said 'past due'.

The Monday after New Years, I received another letter, to the correct address from a collection agency saying I had a bill that was being collected on because I failed to pay it in August.  The only associated number was the same one I called before.  They tell you to press '6', then '1', etc, and you get a prompt that indicates you want to pay a on a collection notice.  Since it's the same number, and they have a menu prompt, this can't be an uncommon thing for them.

I got through to a representative, and explained they had been sending bills to the wrong place, I wasn't getting those bills, and when I did, there is no information in the bill as to what it was for.  The rep said they saw I had called to get a reprint, but that I refused to pay the bill.  I asked them if they could send me the actual invoice that i was supposedly missing, and they told me it looked like it was for 2 bills, one back in December of '21 for a partial Medicare copay.  I explained to them I am not on medicare (I still work and have private insurance), and I wasn't in the facility in December.

I asked them to send me an updated invoice to my email, that I think they have some mistakes on the bill, and to ask the collection agency to back down.  I also asked for a reference number for the call so when I called back i would have a case already opened.  She said I just needed to use my 'account id'.

I know exactly how much my dad gets deposited each month.  I know my mother gets much less Soc Sec deposited in her 'grocery account', as she doesn't take care of any of the day to day finances.  I keep hearing people tell me different things, and different websites seem to muddy the issue.

Will my father's monthly deposits continue as-is amounts to my mother once he is gone?  
Will my mother need to discontinue her benefits in order to take over his greater ones or get both?  
Knowing the amount, is there some sort of a percentage calculation of what they are receiving today?

I am trying to work with them both on asset management.  I have as much of the information as I can get so far (property, loans, accounts, etc), but my dad doesn't want to deal with it, and my mother is having daily panic attacks that she will be destitute on the streets when he is gone.",,,,,

My father has gone into hospice, and has a limited time left. We are trying to figure out his vehicle situation as it pertains to my mom.  Weâ€™re in NY. 

Mom and dad have 2 vehicles, both with my father on the titles. A 2022 car with about $18k left on the loan, and a 2012 pickup that is free of debt.  My mom wants to keep the car, and my sisters family is willing to buy the truck for the cost of my moms car loan.

While my father can still sign the titles over, my sister is considering paying off the car loan to the bank to clear that debt, then having dad sign that title over to my mom, and then â€˜giftingâ€™ the truck to my sister (NY has no gift tax).  Will that avoid us having to pay sales tax on the money we pay for the loan?  Will the bank or the government raise any red flags if we pull money out of my sisters savings account, and then pay the bank loan off under my fathers name?  Is there anything we need to worry about with potential probate court and his other debt (only a credit card and a loan for the house)?

Weâ€™re also trying to avoid my mom or my sister taking out another car loan at a higher rate, just to transfer the title and reregister the car. The bank has made it clear that once my father is no longer with us, the loan has to be closed and a new loan under the new title owner.",,,,,

ELI5.  I have about 7-9 months in an emergency fund.  Around $20k.  Right now the 'savings' account I have it in is basically nothing, like .05%.  I want to get it into something that is not super easy to just move money out of (a few days is fine), but doesn't lock my money up for years at a time.

Recently been given a medical diagnosis that might leave me unemployed and disabled in 2-3 years. I wont need intensive care, bur without getting into details I wonâ€™t be able to do many job functions (so still could find a job of some kindâ€¦ but not counting on it).

Wife and I (both age 31) a combined income of 200k (120k for me 80k for her) my wife will be at 100k in a few years, so that could be the sole income.  But if I am unable to work at age 32-33 I need to have a good system set up of security.

We have been very financially smart,  but worried about me not being able to bring money in here soon. Here is our set up.


* to start our full net worth is around 730 which is in:
* 25k Savings (was for new house and emergency fund)
* 22K I bonds (was for newhouse and emergency fund)
* 6K HSA
* 100K non retirement brokerage
* 106k roth (with 66K I could technically pull of contributions)
* 50K in 401K
*We have a house that is valued at 400k and we have 3 years to pay it off 
(at 3k a month. we are going 1k over our mortgage but once I got my medical issues I wanted this as a peace of mindâ€¦ sort of so we wouldnâ€™t have to worry about our largest expense. I know this is against popular logic but this is important to meâ€¦ to be able to feel like I took care of the biggest expense while I had my job and health)


**So my real question isâ€¦ where should I be putting any extra money? Through out the next few years ill have 1-1.5K a month potentially I could put in places like Roth, HSA, and non tax brokerage account.**

 I am confident in my wifeâ€™s role so we will have income coming in (100k) and we will have our house paid off right around the time I wonâ€™t be able to workâ€¦. But if I am maxing out my roth (6k), HAS (3.5k) and 401K (30.5k after company match a year) for another 2 years, that still puts us in a great position. 

I realize while not idealâ€¦I have near 160ishK of accessible money for some horrible double loss of employment or something. That includes roth and some avenues not ideal for early use. 

But outside of keep on keeping on this pathâ€¦ what should I be doing with extra money I want to be accessible once I get out of work, the non-retirement brokerage? Bonds? High yield savings account? Any advice welcomed.

**Alsoâ€¦. The last year with my medical diagnosis has left me depressed and suicidalâ€¦ seeing a therapist has literally saved my life and gave me a positive outlook. I encourage anyone to do so if struggling.**

**I fully realize that outside of my health I am blessed with an amazing wife who is gonna help me out as well as a very strong financial start to everything. So i hope the numbers dont come off as a humble brag**

EDIT:I also wanted to add.... my biggest regret is not doing disability insurance. My company has 6 month STD and 2 year LTD at 60% so that does provide an even further buffer of 2.5 years of semi pay... but the same concept applies. how can i best put extra money for my future that can be ACCESSIBLE",,,,,
ohmrj0,dipcupdipcup,"Plan to aggressively pay off condo (2.3 years), save for downpayment on house (need 50K more), and modestly invest (6K a year Roth)

Recently married in the US, and we have a net worth of $292k (see break down). We are both 29 years old. We have a small combined monthly income (7.2k) and make a combined 80k after taxes. Both of our jobs don't really offer any retirement account or benefits, so we just fund a roth yearly ourselves.

Due to a generous gift as well as a unique family situation, we are planning to pay off the condo we live in, in 2.3 years. This needs to be done time wise for a family situation far too complicated to explain. To do this, we are paying 4K a month (for the next 2.3 years). The idea is to pay it off in the 2.3 years, any leftover money save up for a down payment for a new house (try to get about 100k, so we are halfway there with 50k savings), and then because of that aggressive strategy, just barely fund our roths (6K each). If we aren't able to save another 50K, after we pay off the condo, we will aggressively save for another year or two since we will own the condo and no mortgage payments. 

The grand idea... is rent out the condo (for 1.5-2k a month) and then use that to pay most of the monthly mortgage on a large house (20-30 year mortgage). Thus, since that is paying off most of the mortgage, our salaries will feel much larger than they are (used for investments, savings, set). 

The downside of this plan, is that we are neglecting our retirement accounts a bit for the next few years, as we might have to dip into savings/the down payment fund to get that 6k a year each. We kinda decide paying off the house and viewing that as our investment for the next few years is our goal.

I wanted to run this plan by here to see peoples thoughts. We have to pay the condo this way. Is focusing on this and the downpayment better then investing for a few years? Should we hold off on the downpayment and make the Roth a priority for the 2-3 years? Funding the roth for 2-3 years is 24-36K that could be for the downpayment. Or is it best to save and do roth and once the condo is payed then aggressively save.

Does your answer change if weâ€™re talking Roth IRA not employee 401(k)? I have about $15K/year available to save.

I really like the idea of Roth since I know exactly how much I have and donâ€™t need to worry about tax rates come withdrawal time, but I donâ€™t want to let personal preference get in the way of the better financial decision, especially since my marginal tax rate is so high. I (22M) live in CA and am making ~70k/yr which puts me at a 31.3% marginal tax rate: 22% federal + 9.3% CA (though only a ~21% effective tax rate).

kczrha,disgruntIed_giraffe,"Basic Investing Advice to get you started.

I wrote this out for a friend, thought it might be helpful to share here too. The goal is to provide some context for beginners and show how to get started. Iâ€™m open to questions from anyone trying to learn, or critiques from the veterans.

First off the rule of thumb is to only have your emergency fund and expected upcoming expenses in cash, everything else should be invested. Think about how much cash you need, and in the meantime you can start small by investing a little bit each month and increasing your contributions as you get more comfortable. For how you should be investing, Iâ€™m going to recommend putting everything into a Total Stock Market Index Fund.
 
A Total Market Index Fund tracks the performance of the entire US stock market. The way it works is it has almost 3,700 different stocks in it, each weighted based on their total value in the stock market. For example Apple is the biggest company in the US by market value, worth 6.5% of the entire stock market. Microsoft is the next biggest at 5%. So if you have $100,000 invested in a Total Market Index Fund, itâ€™s like you actually have $6,500 invested in Apple, $5,000 in Microsoft, and so on based on each of the 3,700 stocks weighted values.
 
The S&amp;P 500 is another popular index fund. It is comprised of the 500 biggest companies in the US and makes up over 2/3 of the total stock market, so it has a lot of overlap with the Total Stock Market Index Fund, but it has a little less exposure since it excludes the smaller companies. Historically the performances of these two indexes have been nearly identical.
 
The S&amp;P 500 and Total Stock Market have had over 13% annual growth over the last 10 years, so in that timeframe $100,000 invested wouldâ€™ve grown to ~$370,000, which is a great example of how powerful investing is over sitting on cash, but itâ€™s also important to note that past performance does not guarantee future performance. These last 10 years have had particularly strong growth, and Iâ€™d be surprised if it keeps that pace.
 
The Total Stock Market fund and S&amp;P 500 fund are both synonymous with â€œthe Market,â€ and are two examples of low-cost, passively invested index funds. Index funds seek market average returns, but there are thousands of actively managed mutual funds to choose from which are more expensive and exist on the belief that theyâ€™ll â€œbeat the Market.â€ Some do, but in reality most end up underperforming, which is why Iâ€™m recommending a cheap and easy index fund.
 
You can find these funds at any of the big investment firms: choose from either Fidelity, Vanguard, or Charles Schwab. To use Fidelityâ€™s Total Stock Market Index Fund, FSKAX, thereâ€™s no minimum investment, and the fee is only 0.015%, so every $1,000 you have invested will cost you 15 cents each year. Good practice for investing is to consistently contribute every month, as much as you can afford. You can do things like set up direct deposit to have a portion of your paycheck go straight to your investments, or automatically transfer some amount from your bank like $500 every month, or just contribute each month based on how much you have available. They have good customer service that will help you get setup.  
 
Note on the power of compounding interest: Historically the market has averaged 10% annual returns. At that rate of growth, if you were to invest $1,000/mo for 40 years, you would end up with over 5 million dollars, having contributed a total of $480,000. $500/mo would get you over 2.5 million dollars from $240,000 in total contributions.

Afterthought: Investing is much easier than most think, you just need to find the right fund(s) and contribute monthly, can even set that up automatically. It does get slightly more complex as you get older and as you accumulate more wealth. Once you cross a certain threshold of wealth, and Iâ€™m talking $200,000+ invested, itâ€™d be a good idea to get more diversified. And as you get closer to retirement, youâ€™ll want to invest more conservatively. But both of those are just a matter of adding a couple more funds to your portfolio and choosing how much you want in each one.

kt7mt4,disgruntIed_giraffe,"22M living in California, should I go with Roth or Traditional 401(k)?

There are a few factors to consider and I could use some perspective or opinions on sorting it out. Note that regardless of my 401(k) decision, I plan on opening a Roth IRA and maxing that out annually until retirement.

1. Income: My income is ~$70k and I expect to have a lot more in retirement after 40 years of steady contributions. However because of CA taxes, $70k means Iâ€™m already in the 31.3% tax bracket (22% federal + 9.3% CA). Based on todayâ€™s tax rates, my income would have to be a whole lot higher for my future effective tax rate to be more than 31.3%, especially since Iâ€™ll likely be married. [Higher income in retirement is a pro for Roth, though itâ€™s hard to swallow paying 31.3% today thinking itâ€™d be even more in the future]

2. Location: Living in CA puts me in a very high income tax state, and who knows if Iâ€™ll end up here, or somewhere with lower taxes. It would be nice to stay in CA but anything can happen over these next 40 years. [pro for Traditional since I could only end up in an equal or a lower income tax state]

3. Future tax rates: With relatively low tax rates today and the current state of debt, itâ€™s hard to imagine taxes wonâ€™t be significantly higher 40 years from now. I feel a little risk averse on the fear of doing traditional then getting slammed by taxes in retirement. [pro for Roth because expecting future rates to be higher]

4. Pension: I have a small pension plan at my company. Nothing major but it would definitely serve to raise my retirement income. But unless I stay at this company this point is not applicable. [pro for Roth because higher retirement income if I stay with company]

5. Roth reliability: I think itâ€™s less likely but worth noting the possibility of the government finding ways to tax Roth in the future, whether itâ€™s wealth tax, sales tax, or just diminished Roth benefits. [pro for Traditional]",,,,,
mm42vv,disgruntIed_giraffe,"Looking to buy an apartment for my twenties, then eventually upgrade to a house. Rather than selling the apartment for cash for the next down payment, would it be ideal if feasible to keep apartment as a rental property?

I know a lot goes into that question in terms of the investment value of the specific property, but Iâ€™m just looking for insight on this strategy as a way to broaden my portfolio. If I can save up for the second down payment without needing to sell the apartment, and if I can find renters that will cover the apartmentâ€™s mortgage after moving out, then Iâ€™ll eventually come out owning the apartment and can earn rental income or cash out if needed. My primary and only source of investing right now is saving 15-20% of my income via IRA and 401k, and Iâ€™ll continue to do that until I retire. Iâ€™m thinking anything above that 15-20% could go toward maintaining this property, rather than toward increasing retirement contributions. 

I know I need to be prepared to handle both my apartment mortgage and home mortgage in times when renters fall out, plus plenty of maintenance costs to consider. But assuming Iâ€™m in a good enough financial position to handle those (steady income, big emergency fund), should I make it a goal to pursue this option? If so then when I do buy the apartment that Iâ€™ll live in, Iâ€™ll also have to consider its investment potential rather than just is it a good/affordable place to live.

I like this option because it would increase my portfolio beyond just my 401k and IRA, and I see this as the only way Iâ€™d be able to get into real estate investing, as I donâ€™t want to outright buy a rental property, but soon Iâ€™ll have to buy a place to live, so after a few years I will have some equity in it and be able to make a more informed decision on keeping that property as an investment.",,,,,
nadmbs,disgruntIed_giraffe,"To pay off or not to pay off debt...

Looking for some friendly â€œWhat Would You Doâ€™sâ€ in my situation. 

I (23M) have close to $30k in student loan debt and am otherwise debt free. The average interest rate is 4.5% with loans ranging from 4 to 5.5%. I have a full emergency fund, save approximately 15-20% of my paycheck in retirement accounts, and save about ~$2k a month in cash that I have not yet determined how to use. The excess cash could go toward: 
* Paying off debt quickly
* Saving for a downpayment on a home (not urgent but I want to be ready to do this in the next few years)
* Increasing retirement contributions

Thinking my main two options are as follows:
1. Put that $2k/mo entirely toward student loans, have them paid off by summer of 2022, then start saving for a house while seeing if thereâ€™s extra room in the budget to increase retirement contributions
2. Make the minimum monthly payments over the life of the loan while prioritizing increasing retirement contributions and start saving for a down payment when necessary. 

The emotional component is in favor of option #1 as I think it would feel great to not have to worry about debt anymore, but I know the loan interest isnâ€™t that high especially since Iâ€™m young, so looking strictly at the math Iâ€™m likely better off investing (though I do think this might be slightly offset by the seemingly increased risk of market uncertainty at this time).

qkpf0y,disgruntIed_giraffe,"Downsides to using my Roth 401k instead of standard Brokerage Account for a 5-10 year investment life?

Background - Iâ€™m 24 with an 80K income in a HCOL area. Iâ€™m contributing 20% of my income toward retirement between a Roth IRA and Roth 401K (might switch to traditional 401K in the coming years but doing Roth for now), which equates to 6K to the IRA and 10K to the 401K, so I still have 9.5K of unused Roth 401K contributions. I donâ€™t want to increase retirement contributions beyond 20% because I feel thatâ€™s a good baseline and that I should prioritize saving for the likelihood of needing a downpayment on a home in the next 5-10 years.

Question - Since my timeline for a downpayment is 5-10 years, I figure I should be investing that money rather than holding it all in cash. Rather than using a taxable brokerage account, would it make sense to save for a down payment via increasing my Roth 401k contributions, with the intention of withdrawing that money in 5-10 years, since thereâ€™s a penalty free early withdrawal exception for first-time homebuyers? If that exception includes the non taxable Roth growth (correct me if it doesnâ€™t), then essentially I can invest without capital gains tax up until reaching my Roth 401K limit, and the downside of not being able to withdraw until age 59.5 is eliminated since this falls under one of the early withdraw exceptions.

rfk1yb,disgruntIed_giraffe,"Does high inflation incentivize holding onto debt?

I have 30K student loan debt with 4.5% interest, and Iâ€™ve always used that 4.5% number as the basis for my internal pay off debt v invest argument, i.e. pay off debt for the security of being debt free and receive a guaranteed 4.5% rate of return, or invest hoping for better returns. 

Now with inflation on the rise, it devalues the amount of debt I have and offsets the interest I owe. Iâ€™m salaried and receive annual inflation-based raises, so letâ€™s assume next year I get a 4.5% inflation raise applied to my salary, that would loosely translate to my loan being interest free in terms of real dollars right?

So now the debate becomes pay off debt for the security of being debt free or invest hoping for better returns, except now the returns just have to beat inflation or it to be net positive. Does my logic here make sense?

Edit: after reading comments I think I can more accurately summarize my viewpoints
* Inflation offsets interest on debt in terms of real dollars
* Assuming 4.5% inflation, the real value of my debt remains the same, but the nominal dollars increases which still affects me, but THIS is offset if I get the 4.5% inflation raise
* Due to the above two points, in the debate of Debt v Investing: interest rate on my debt is no longer a factor in the equation, and if I choose investing, I just need to outpace inflation for a net positive.",,,,,
wpfapm,disgruntIed_giraffe,"How to calculate personal savings rate when saving before and after tax dollars?

I know Iâ€™m splitting hairs here, but it helps me with tracking and goal setting.

Hypothetical $100k gross salary and 75k net salary. Annual savings is 10k pre-tax to 401k and 6k after-tax to Roth IRA. So what is my savings rate? Seems incorrect to combine pre-tax/after-tax and say Iâ€™m saving 16k per year, which could equate to a 16% savings rate or 21% depending on whether Iâ€™m dividing by gross or net income.

I figure the simplest and most accurate formula is to do pre-tax savings/gross income + after-tax savings/net income as follows:
* 10k pre-tax / 100k gross income = 10% savings rate
* 6k Roth / 75k net income = 8% savings rate 
* Total savings rate = 10% + 8% = 18%

Simultaneously, I had an out - my landlord had not signed the lease (there were some other issues, not the point), so I got out and started looking for cheaper places. I found one for $500/mo cheaper. 

But I forfeited my $1000 security deposit. It's in the contract that if you apply for a lease but don't end up signing, they keep the deposit. Moving was already so expensive for me. That's 3% of my current income, vanished into thin air.

I quite stupidly took out a student loan at 8.5% 12 years ago from my credit union, and now that I have graduated (PhD) my payments are resuming in 6 months. I'd like to be able to plan for this recurring monthly expense. Unfortunately, I have no idea where the loan paperwork is - my mom has passed away, I live 1000 miles from my parents' home, and haven't been able to find the paperwork when I visit.

So call I did. They said sorry, I'm unable to see that information. I asked to escalate the call to ""loan services"".

My field (physics) has plenty of good jobs without going to graduate school, but for the positions I'd like, a PhD is required.

In &lt;6 months, I will graduate with my PhD (physics, from an Ivy) and will make approximately 100k. I do not yet have an offer, but I have enough connections in industry that for all intents and purposes, this is guaranteed.

However, my rent just went up by $500/month. When I moved in seven years ago, I paid $1000/month, it went up to $1500/month over the past seven years, and is now $2000. 

My plan was to graduate this May, in which case I would not have had to sign a new lease. However, as my mom passed away and I had to take time off to play home hospice nurse for a few months, I am now graduating in the fall.

As a result, I am chewing through my savings. I will also need to move after I graduate, as I live in the middle of nowhere and my PhD focus is very niche. I am planning on taking out an unsecured personal loan out for first+last+security when I move, as most jobs are in the Boston area where first+last+security will run 8k easily.

* Undergrad student loans: $20k (payment not required until after graduation)
* Monthly expenses: $730
* Vehicles: Both owned outright, car worth $2k motorcycle worth $500
* Emergency fund: $1k
* Investment accounts: $4k
* Roth IRA: $4k


I paid off about $10k of student loans while in grad school, despite not being required to pay, just because I hated seeing the interest rack up. I also put a measly amount of money into an IRA, both of which were kind of stupid as I chewed through my savings so quickly once my rent went up.

I went to my credit union where I have been a customer since age 12 (with a kiddo account).

Hey there!

I am a PhD student (F29) making 40k gross right now, with $1600 monthly rent/utilities expenses. I also spend about $1k/mo for everything else.

I just got a job at a startup in an HCOL area (Boston, MA). There are a lot of things I've never had to worry about before (student loans, retirement plans, health insurance) and I'd love a second (third, fourth... thousandth...) set of eyes.

My gross income will be 130k. From online calculators, it seems like I will lose about 34k to taxes so 96k net, a nice round $8k/mo take home pay.

**8k take home**

From this, I will take $6k and put into a separate account so that I will never see it. I will pay:

**$500 - student loans** I have about $28k (before any forgiveness) at 4%. I think making the minimum payments here makes sense, as I earn more in the market.

**$500 - Roth IRA** I have a target date fund through Schwab. This will max out my Roth IRA contributions for the year as I understand. Since my job is at a startup, there are no retirement plans or anything.

**$500 - HDHP premium and HSA contribution**. I don't know exactly what health plans are offered by my employer as I don't start formally until February, but if it's an option I'd prefer an HDHP with an HSA. If I can, I'll put $300/mo away in the HSA to max it out. Otherwise this will just be my premium. I'm a healthy single person so don't have much need for a low-deductible plan.

**$3500 - rent/utilities** No way to get around this one, I'm afraid. I've signed the lease and set up utilities. Might go down in the future but not planning on it right now.

**$150 - car/renters insurance combo** 

**$850 - non-tax-advantaged investment account** This will be my emergency fund. I rent and won't need a car for commuting, so I'm okay with this being in the market. Also will help with a car downpayment in the future, or a house downpayment in the far far far far future. At first, this will actually go toward paying off a loan I took out to move - I get a signing bonus which covered a lot, but not everything...

That is the 6k that I won't ever look at. I will then have 2k for spending money:

**$300 - savings account** For things like vacations, gifts, random shit.

**$800 - groceries/restaurant** This is about 20% above what I spend now when I'm lazy about budgeting, allowing a bit of lifestyle inflation (and HCOL inflation...)

**$200 - clothing** I know this sounds ridiculous. My clothes are falling apart, and as a grad student lab rat I've spent most of my days in comfy informal clothing.

**$700 - misc** Vet bills. Cat food. Vehicle fuel. Random shit. Honestly I find that everything that isn't food totally racks up without even thinking about it.

11drqxr,DoctorQuinlan,"[Auto] Would it be better to wait to buy an SUV with all cash (or with a car loan)?

I really need to get my own vehicle soon, but for now am borrowing a relative's. I pay them, but would like to be independent. I have a good amount of cash saved up to buy my own SUV. Looking mostly at used Toyota Rav4's or Subaru Forrester's (but willing to consider any comparable SUV that has a good reputation and is on the cheaper end - Toyotas, Hondas, Hyundais, etc.). 

Where things get complicated....I think...

1. Market seems not great now for buying used cars. Prices seem high from what I've heard

2. This would be my first vehicle I bought on my own (ie without parents)

3. Interest rates are high (not a problem if I use cash, but I also wonder if saving cash and investing it would benefit me more - maybe not worth the risk if its 5% +)

4. I could technically use my relative's car longer, but then they (potentially) lose out on the opportunity cost of selling their car sooner

5. I am also looking for a house to buy asap as well

6. I can also buy the vehicle under a family/my LLC I think

7. If I do a loan, would it make sense in today's market? And how does one go about finding a good loan or dealership that offers rebates (just learned this is sometimes a thing)?

I've (30M) been looking for a home for a while (2 years seriously, another 1 year casually). I have about $100k in my savings account (Ally - earning a decent 3.4%). I'm also currently living with my parents, with minimal expenses (gas, eating out, groceries, leisure, etc. - no loans luckily). 

I really have no idea if I'll find a house this summer.  If I don't by August or September or so, I am definitely getting an apartment 12 month lease, because I cant stand being at home. I also hope to purchase a used SUV (Toyota Rav4 or Subaru Forrester) probably towards the end of the year or whenever prices get back down.

I came across this living wage calculator that lets you pick your county, life situation and gives you your estimated local living wage and usually these are bullshit in my opinion but this one literally hit it right on the head (almost). My expenses this year track to be ~66k and thatâ€™s almost exactly what the calculator had it at. Says 66k and that basically a person with a non working spouse and two kids would need that much + taxes so around ~78k to live. Itâ€™s interesting because Iâ€™m a total pessimist so I always think about if I lose my job and had to take a new one, whatâ€™s the least amount of salary I could take and still get byâ€¦so that ~80k is always in my head so it was interesting to see that Iâ€™m living basically at the average.

Iâ€™ve never had a brokerage account, always did Roth IRA and traditional 401k which are easy when it comes to income taxes. 

I have read that with a brokerage you have to claim/pay tax on gains for that year even if you donâ€™t take the money out (lame).

So, if Iâ€™m using todayâ€™s example of a couple that makes 100k and files jointly and has a standard deduction of 27k = 73k taxable income. 12% marginal tax rate (12% rate up to 83k).

Letâ€™s say you invest 10k and make 2k by the end of the year, for easy math sake. Is that 2k taxed as income, making your taxable income 75k instead of 73? Also, I know it can get tricky year over year with how much of the gains are on money you put in vs gains/ especially if you do DCAâ€¦does a form come in yrly that explains those gains that you can use on your form or is it up to you to determine what is taxed?

Doesn't it seem silly to think SS won't be there and not at least expect \~20k a person (todays dollars) in SS, when you see/hear how many people >60 have next to nothing saved for retirement? It just seems odd so many people say to act like you'll get nothing, but those same people say ""oh of the market doesn't go up in a few decades > now, then we have bigger things to worry about"", isn't that the same case with SS being gone?_x000D_

Reason I ask is when I see ""1m in today's dollars isn't enough to retire""...to me, at least, thinking about having 1m in retirement for my wife and I and having a paid off house, seems fine. If I retire at 65 with 1m in 401k and start taking out my SS + wifes (estimates in todays dollars) of \~55k a year there + SWR of even 35k to be safe...that gives us 90k a year to take out with low taxable income and no FICA taxes leaves us with over 80k to spend, we don't even spend that now!_x000D_

I know a Roth IRA should be used for retirement, get that. I know people use taxable account for different reasons, get that. 

What I am wondering, though, is if someone has a healthy 401k from work and has an extra 7k a year to save why would they put it in a taxable brokerage account before putting in a Roth IRA? 

The way I see it is if I am 30 and do 7k a year to a Roth at 45 I have 105k of TAX FREE contributions I could take out of my Roth IRA at any point vs had it been in a brokerage paying 15% on that money. I know the other (gains) on the Roth cannot be taken out so perhaps thatâ€™s the situation itâ€™s better but I would imagine for a lot of people the Ira is a better option especially those with a more traditional life whoâ€™s kids start going to college/get married when the parent is 50â€¦you could have close to 300k between you and your spouse of money you could pull out for things like that and pay 0 tax on it vs paying if you had to take it out of a taxable brokerage assuming youâ€™re still working and making a good salary.

Is this kinda the rule of thumb/is there one and does the % keep swaying in the cash direction a few % points the older you get? Basically wondering what the standard is with this at/close to retirement then through the remainder of retirement.

2. Transamerica Lifegoal 2025 with Blackrock Ret Acct is the one I looked at, they have a different one for every 5 year increment until 2026â€¦what happens with the people who are in this (2025) one when 2025 passes and it drops off the list of available allocations on the Transamerica website? Does it grandfather in or something even if itâ€™s not there until you go in and change it to something new (if thatâ€™s something you want to do)?",,,,,

Taxation in Retirement vs Now

Someone help me understand the difference between taxes and retirement versus now (broad level).

I get a standard deduction and now, Iâ€™m married filing joint. 93k a year, max 401k and 5k in HSA. So that should be ~69k AGI, then 25k standard deduction puts us at 44k taxable income. 12% bracket but an effective tax rate of like 6% federally if my math is correct?

Letâ€™s say when I retire and I push off my SS benefits until Iâ€™m 70, it says on the SS site that my wife and I could get 79k a year (3316/mo)..if I couple that with say a RMD on my 401k of 60k. Iâ€™m at 149k, but I donâ€™t know how the SS money plays into that, is it half of it thatâ€™s taxed? So 70k + (.5 SS) 40 for a total of 111k AGI?

â€¦so confused, reason Iâ€™m looking at it is to figure out if I need to start contributing to my Roth instead of my Traditional 401k. 33 with 160k in traditional, if I keep maxing it out Iâ€™m going to have RMDs that are higher than what I make now lol",,,,,

My job offers me the ability to work from home, going into the office once a week right now just to get out really but donâ€™t really have to. Worked remote a bit before but since COVID, 2 of my coworkers moved out of stateâ€¦I like where I live, just not in the winter so Iâ€™m wondering if anyone currently is still working and instead of buying a condo only to live in for a couple months a year just goes the Airbnb route?

Iâ€™m thinking I can get a condo once a year for a couple months while WFH and even after I retire if itâ€™s for a few months and itâ€™s headache free and you can stay in different places when you want, new cities, etc. anyone retired/close to retirement do this or plan on doing this? Donâ€™t know that this is the right place to ask it but seemed kinda up the alley lol. Growing up people always wanted to retire in Florida or had timeshares or whatever but now with Airbnb you could just dog down after Christmas and New Years for a couple months and pay 5-6k probably for both months instead of paying that for a home owners association a year in a place youâ€™re only staying at a few months a year. Plus youâ€™re not trapped going to the same place forever. Obviously if you own one you can eventually move to it and you have it all year and can have friends use it, rent it etc but just seems like Airbnb routes so convenient",,,,,
pn6bbo,DoeJumars,"33, wish I got this advice a decade agoâ€¦

MAX OUT YOUR HSA (if you have one).

Since I started out of college (debt free luckily) I have been pretty much contributing to my 401k at least a bit, maxing out last few yearsâ€¦.all fine and dandy. Now Iâ€™m making some good $ and thinking I can keep maxing it then I get more interested in retirement so I do reading instead of putting my head down and maxing my 401k and not thinking twice and just letting this hsa account sit thereâ€¦

Your HSA account (after 65) works EXACTLY like your 401k does, but betterâ€¦no required distribution minimums so you arent left trying to figure out how much to take out to stay in a low tax bracket, you can use the balances in the account to pay medical expenses ANY TIME YOU WANT, then if youâ€™re lucky enough to pay medical expenses out of pocket you can go in and reimburse yourself for decades worth of medical expenses.

skj40s,DoeJumars,"Order of operations, in retirement? (hypothetical)

Hey all,

Lets assume rules and brackets are like they are today, these numbers are my assumptions in 26 years for myself.

**..I am 60, MFJ and retired.**

&amp;#x200B;

* **1.5m** in 401k that I just rolled over to a **Roth IRA (70/30 split stocks/bonds)**
* **900k** (445 in mine, 445 in my wifes- who I contribute to via the spousal Roth since she doesn't work)  **Roth IRA (100% SP 500)**
* **250k in HSA (100% SP 500**

&amp;#x200B;

*...kid(s) are in college/finishing up, I have a 529 setup for them which should cover costs or at least a good chunk of them, so assume they're good there.*

*My wife and I can live off 65k a year. House paid off, if anything we could downsize. This lets us live life, enjoy some vaca's, etc.*

**My question is, what order should I do things? In my mind:**

1. Take out \~85k in IRA money a year which after taxes gives me that 65k I need to live life from age 60-70 or as long as I can (*put off SS until 70*).
2. I have \~25k left that I can roll over from my IRA to Roth and pay minimal taxes on to fill the 12% bracket (MFJ) and let that grow tax free for later via a conversion/ladder whatever you want to call it, Repeat step 1-2 as long as I can until the well runs dry. *All the while my Roth IRA and HSA keep growing, I use the HSA to pay any big medical expense but hoping they wont be that crazy.*
3. My IRA gets milked dry eventually because I am taking out close to 6% a year plus the \~25k I am rolling over which is basically 8%, twice the recommended amount...but instead of doing me 30 years it will do me \~15 which is probably more than I really need since SS is about to hit at 70 for wife and I. 
4. Now I am 70, have put off SS long enough. I don't have much left in the IRA so I can use that to fill lower tax brackets, wife and I are combined supposed to get 59k a year in SS by now which probably will only be taxed at 50% because I am using only \~30k in IRA a year to fill the lower brackets. I still roll over the excess like I have been until I am finally dry of IRA.
5. Now I have no IRA but my Roths have been growing forever, same with HSA and we get a lot of SS. Rest of my life I can pull out anything in Roth tax free, use SS to fill lower tax brackets, HSA for health still...

Hey all,

I have my job where I get my traditional 401k and I contribute 6k in addition to a personal Roth IRA of mine.

Iâ€™m about to start a secondary freelance gig where I  be 1099. I havenâ€™t ever been 1099 so looking for ways to lessen the blow at tax time. 

1. Can I open a SEP IRA to do this? If so what are the limits assuming I max out my 401k and Roth already?

2. I have read you have to pay quarterly taxes to IRS when you are 1099 (annoying), can I just withhold more taxes from my w2 job so they are getting more every check off me and will be off my back about any penalties come tax filing season?

3. Iâ€™ve always taken standard deduction because my w2 was cut and dry, seeing as Iâ€™m part 1099 now can I write off expenses while taking that standard deduction still or do I have to rework everything and itemize all my stuffâ€¦just wondering if itâ€™s worth it and if Iâ€™ll have more than 25k to write off. 

4. Am I right to (simplified) assume that if I make 100k (married file jointly, wife doesnâ€™t work) in my w2 and I make 40k 1099 that my income is 140k, less the standard deduction,  less any 401k, HSA, SEP Ira plus paying double FICA tax on that 40k (or the portion of it thatâ€™s not deductible or whatever)?
