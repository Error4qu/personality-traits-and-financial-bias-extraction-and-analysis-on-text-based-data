kvi5l5,merc97,"What should I do with my finances in 2021? (60% comp. increase, early 20s)

I just turned 24 years old, living in a HCOL city. In 2020, I made around $105,000. In 2021 this should increase significantly to $165,000.

**Current net worth ($50,000):**

* **IRA**: $13,500 (maxed contribution for 2020 and 2019 tax years)
* **401k**: $0 - just started, no match
* **Cash**: $36,500
* **Debt**: $0

**Income for 2021**:

* **Income**: $85,000 base salary + $80,000 bonus (paid quarterly)
* **Pre-tax Deductions:** 10% to 401(k) no match, $4,000/year for 0-deductible health insurance.
* ***Net***\*\*:\*\* after tax/deductions, should be left with around $94,500/yr (**$7,875/month)**.

**Expenses**:

* **Rent/utilities:** $1,650/month (may increase by around $400-800/mo if I move to my own place in August).
* **Spending** (averaged to include vacations etc): $2,350/month
* ***Total:*** **$4,000/month**

So essentially I have $3,875/month ($46,500/yr) leftover to save/invest (maybe a few hundred less if I increase my rent), in addition to saving \~$16,500/year in 401(k).

I know this is an insane amount of disposable income for my age and I don't know what to do with it. I'm mostly still living on my post-college salary expenses. 

It's my understanding I am now above the income limits for IRA/Roth IRA. And I know I should probably set aside \~$20,000 for an emergency fund. So should I just open an...investment account? Save to buy an apartment?",Yes,Yes,No,No,No

If I don't want to convert the entire traditional IRA balance to a Roth and pay taxes on the previous years' contributions, can I **just** contribute $6,000 this year to the IRA, and then convert that portion to a Roth using the backdoor strategy?

* **16: Enter an estimate of your federal adjustments to income, such as deductible IRA contributions you will make for the tax year.**  Would this include pre-tax 401(k) contributions and pre-tax health insurance?

odpxal,merc97,"(May be NYC-specific): Can you be financially successful being a renter for your entire life?

I make a good 6-figure income and could conceivably save for a down payment and afford the mortgage on a nice 1 bedroom apartment (in the $650-800k range).

But owning an apartment in NYC just seems like such a hassle in terms of being responsible for taxes, maintenance, potentially a co-op board, etc etc. And not having the freedom to move around when I want to experience a different neighborhood.

I definitely see NYC as being my home base for the rest of my life. And the good renters' rights laws in NYC make renting not too bad... in general, you won't be dealing with some small-time landlord who doesn't let you hang things on the walls and harasses you constantly. 

But I have this weird feeling that if I don't own property, I will never be truly secure even if I build wealth in other ways. Or that in a place like NYC, the cost of rent will always go up a lot (unless you secure a stabilized apartment).

This may be a very NYC-specific question as there aren't many other parts of the country with such a unique housing market, but what are everyone's thoughts on this?",Yes,Yes,No,Yes,Yes

15on6b7,metalreflectslime,"Can my family afford this house?

My family currently lives in San Jose, CA, USA.

We are moving to Midway City, CA, USA in September 2023 because my brother bought a house there.

The house is 3 bedrooms, 2 bathrooms.

My brother bought the house for $930k, with a down payment of $465k, and he took out a mortgage of $465k to pay for the house.

The interest rate of the mortgage is over 6%.

The monthly mortgage will be $3015, and the monthly house insurance is $1300.

I asked my mother why the house insurance is so expensive.

She said it is because it is an old house that is near the ocean, so there is a risk of flooding or something.

My brother makes $70 per hour as a contract software engineer at Meta via TEKsystems.

Each week, after taxes are withdrawn from his paycheck, he takes home $1875.92.

My parents do not work, and they are over age 65, so they will get retirement Social Security money per month.

My parents claim that they will get $1000 each per month in Social Security.

I currently do not work, so I get $1098.73 per month via SSI.

My mother claims that if my brother dies or loses his job, and we cannot afford the monthly payments on the house, my uncle will buy the house from my brother, and rent it out to my brother for a reduced price.

My uncle has several houses.

My family owns 3 cars with all cars fully paid off.

If you bought a house and you used a mortgage loan and you think you might default on the mortgage loan in the future, is it better to sell the house before you default in order to maximize the amount of money you receive?

If you wait until you default on the loan, and your house gets foreclosed, the bank will take over your house and auction your house off to the highest bidder.

The highest bidder may not offer the bank enough money to pay off the mortgage, so you end up losing your house + owing the left over amount on the mortgage loan.

I'm not looking really for a high yield savings account, what with how interest rates are and will continue to be but I'm wondering if I'm just looking for a savings account to grow an emergency fund before investing, does it even matter where I place the funds?

My main credit card is with Amex, so I'm wondering about their savings account as well. 

But since I have an Investors Checking Account with Charles Schwab - did it for the atm fee free feature - and since I might move my stocks from Ally to them, wouldn't it not be prudent to also move my savings account to them as well?

Hi All, I'm still torn between Fidelity and Schwab. I'm looking for the better company that caters to Stocks, Mutual Funds, Roth IRA, and spend management.

I recently switched from a salaried position to an hourly one (different companies). The move came with a nice bump in pay, which is awesome, but I've hit a bit of a snag when it comes to figuring out my budget.

Does anyone have any insight as far as what I should expect to spend and how I should think about all of this? What should I do as far as the school loans and investing goes, and how should I use the bonus?

I'm starting my first full-time job in a month, first time paying for rent, all of that, and I'm trying to plan my budget and finances and where my money will be going.

I plan on throwing a chunk of money into VTSAX, and then maximizing my 401k to get the company match, and still need to look into a Roth IRA (not really sure what it is or if it's needed when I'm investing in the other two). I pretty much have a 6 month emergency fund already, and I also have savings categories like car expenses, school loans (which I'll pay off at some point over the next 6 months as I have the money for it set aside, but there's no reason to do it yet as interest won't start until November)

So my question is: if I have all of these savings categories such as emergency fund, car repairs, whatever else, and they're all fully funded, is there any reason to arbitrarily ""save"" money i.e. put money into my HYSA as opposed to just investing it into VTSAX or whatever other investment accounts?

13ykf29,Missing_Back,"Is it even worth waiting to pay off a 0% interest credit card for furniture (~$1300)?


I bought a couch for ~$1700, paid 25% of it, and put the rest of it (~$1300) on a CC with the store at 0% for 24 months after delivery. I could pay for it out of pocket, but I'm trying to learn how to use debt effectively, and the general method I'm familiar with is: if you get something with 0% interest, in the meantime put that money somewhere where it will make money for you, and then pay it in full before you ever have to pay any interest.

This is obviously a lot more effective with something like a car loan, since you'll have a lot more money to put somewhere where it will make you money. 

Is it even worth it with something like this? I currently only have a HYSA that I was going to put the money into, but all things said and done, this extra $1300 would only get me like 4 bucks every month. On top of that, I have to make minimum monthly payments so over time that $1300 will slowly decrease. Or I wouldn't touch that $1300 in my savings at all, pay for the minimum payments out of my paycheck (like $30 a month) and then right before the 24 months are up, pay for remaining balance (~$600) either out of that $1300 or potentially each month set aside enough so after 24 months I have the right amount.

Or should I just pay it off as soon as I can and forget about it? Is this amount too small to justify all of this planning and maneuvering?

Discussion with my parents (obviously Iâ€™m an adult and they have no say as to whether or not I get a credit card but itâ€™s just something we talk about):Iâ€™m 22, in college, focusing hard on school and other field related learning, I make $50 a week and save 50% of it (not a legit job, just mowing lawns). I have decent money habits, but to be fair, I also have very little responsibility (I worked a job in high school, spent most of what I earned, and I learned a very important lesson from it). I donâ€™t spend money mindlessly, I go through my checking my and savings every week to be conscious of my money going in and out, like I said transfer 50% of the little bit of money I make every week into savings. I really enjoy seeing that savings number go up, I really hate seeing my checking balance go down. 

 I think getting a credit card would be wise because it can help me build my credit which as I understand is a beneficial thing. Helps later on with loans (car, house, etc). This is things Iâ€™ve heard from different sources, and it seems wise. Although I admit I donâ€™t have as well rounded understanding as I could or should. Hence posts like this.

My parents say I donâ€™t need to worry about credit. I wonâ€™t need credit score because theyâ€™ll co-sign on my first apartment and whatnot, and a credit card wonâ€™t make much of a difference anyways as far as my credit score goes. 

So the question that my mom was wondering, (although Iâ€™m wondering about credit cards in general, not specific to apartments) is â€œwhatâ€™s wiser? Getting a credit card to just build credit as I still live at home, or not worrying about that crap and just let my parents co sign?â€

So the formula is something like biweekly pay * 26 / 12 (this is from the budget spreadsheet in the wiki)

Currently just started with a new company, as a Sales Manager. So my salary is $90k and my variable (at 100% of my team's quota) is $40k. Let's be conservative and say my annual earnings is $115k (depending on how my team performs and such) plus or minus some. 

**Currently:** 

* I have about $85k in my past employer's 401k, which I will be rolling over to an IRA with Fidelity. 
* I have roughly $2k in HSA, which I am rolling over to Fidelity's HSA account. My new company doesn't have an HSA health plan, so from my understanding, I cannot contribute to an HSA plan and rather get it under one umbrella with Fidelity. 
* I max out my Roth IRA every year with Fidelity - $500 each month
* I currently own a home, so paying a $1350 mortgage 
* Have 6 months emergency fund in an HYSA - and do contribute to that with each paycheck 
* I have money in Crypto and ETFs and contribute the majority of my money after paying bills at the end of the month (I live a frugal life).

I have been asked by a few friends of why not keep it and rent it out. I sorta thought about it but just figured it would be better to sell and collect the gains and move on. 

I have been thinking about selling v renting it out more. 

If I rented, I could make around $500 a month. 

My house has appreciated $100k in the past 2 years. 

Donâ€™t know what the future looks like for the housing in Denver.

I am good with budgeting my money. I have some knowledge on the market and investing. I feel if I just reinvest into some ETFs like the bogle 3 fund portfolio or something, and / some blue chip individual stocks - that would be pretty similar to what the financial advisor would be doing.

rk1k2m,mjkouris12,"Need Help - adjustments to my investments - HSA, ROTH IRA, 401k, Brokerage

Hey all,
Needing some help/advice and feedback -

Coming into the new year, making some shifts and adjustments to my investing. 

Recently sold my home and made money and purchased a new home with my significant other. So right now, sitting on a pile of cash. 

Any help/advice would be grateful. 

Current investments: 

Roth IRA - With Fidelity: FZROX and FZILX. 
- Currently sitting at $12k+
- I max this out every year.  
- Being an ROTH IRA, should I leave FZROX &amp; FZILX? I know itâ€™s not transferable but not looking to move. 

HSA - With Fidelity: FZROX - this past year I moved it to Fidelity to invest. 
- Currently sitting at $7k+
- Current company is rolling out a High Deductible plan + HSA, so planning on using that plan and maxing it out. 
- Now that my company is rolling out an HSA plan, can I just add to the Fidelity account? Or do I need to use their plan? 
- Is FZROX a smart play? Or should I get Vanguard ETFs so itâ€™s more transferable? 

401k - With Rivers Edge and now my company is moving to Vanguard. 
- Sitting around $108k
- Invested in 100% Schwab S&amp;P 500
- Since we are moving to Vanguard, planning on rolling over and putting it into VTI / VXUS or just VXUS. Does that split work for 401k?

Brokerage - was with Robinhood but liquidated everything when buying this new house. Planning on reinvesting into Fidelity for long term growth. 
- Will be investing around $150k in lump sum. 
- Sticking with Fidelity thinking with my HSA &amp; ROTH IRA will stay for the foreseeable future. 
- Still thinking long term so want ETFs or something similar. Since Iâ€™m doing Fidelity for the Brokerage, makes more sense to do a Vanguard ETF than a Fidelitys FZROX &amp; FZILX since those two you can transfer. 
- Would I get Fees / does it make sense to get Vanguard ETF - VTI / VXUS? 

Crypto - invest a little here and there in Crypto for high risk / high reward. Using Coinbase. 

Currently : 30 years old, no major debt (mortgage), making about $115k a year. 

Just want to make sure my investments are clear away from fees and since lots of the investments are using the same, does that make sense? 

Thanks!",Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes,No

vm1sd6,mjkouris12,"Question around MAGI and Roth IRA.

Beginning of the year on 1/2 I lump summed into my Roth IRA. At that point I was earning $90k base &amp; 40k commission (OTE of 130k). But since thatâ€™s under the 144k MAGI for Roth IRA, it didnâ€™t matter. 

Then a few weeks later they did an market adjustment and bumped my salary up to $106k and commission to be $36k (OTE of $142k). Still under the $144k limit so I wasnâ€™t worried for the year. 

Jump forward to now, I have moved companies and now my base is $140k and $60k commission. 

Which where a few questions come up with ROTH IRAs. 
1. Since I lump summed in the beginning of the year, does it Matter now that I will be in total over the MAGI limit?

I'm reading a lot on backdoor Roth IRA and I want to be sure I'm getting this correct.

the 6 steps to do it

Step #1: Contribute to traditional IRA 

Step #2: Invest the money in a money market fund.

Step #3: Move money from traditional IRA to Roth IRA (i.e. a Roth conversion).

Step #4: Invest in your preferred investment in the Roth IRA

Step #5: Ensure you have no money in a traditional IRA, SEP-IRA, or SIMPLE IRA on December 31st

Step #6: Report the transactions correctly on your taxes by filling out Form 8606.

&amp;#x200B;

As far as I gathered this is done because Roth IRA is no longer available (to high income) and traditional IRA is not offering tax deductions.  So Both Roth and Traditonal IRA are going to be taxed money, but in the traditional  IRA you get taxed at  distribution as well. Doing the backdoor conversion you are saving the taxes that would otherwise happen at distribution with the Trad IRA ?

We cap both our 401k (traditional) so thats 2x 20500 = 51000

I did our taxes in turbotax and it went fine. Sitting at at 900 dollars return ( guess that technically means i lost an average of 6months of interest on those).  I forgot to check taxable income amount and filed it electronically.

I then noticed our taxable income is at around 86.000, so around 5.000 dollars in the 22% taxbracket. I went and dumped in 5.000 in my Tradional IRA with fidelity, and amended my taxes in turbotax.

Turbo tax informs me i can only deduct a bit above 4000 due to AGI,. im fine with that lesson learned to doublecheck that for next yer. But after going through the amendments Turbotax still only show a return of 900 dollars in the ""top""

Yesterday I called them. They tell me it due to the name issue (Chase is in the new last name and Citi is still in the old lastname) and they would need to look into it and get back to me in 24 hours. did not get a call back

$600 a month personal stocks (VTSAX), $541 a month in Roth IRA (VTI), $262 a month Roth 401k, and $262 a month Roth 401k Match. With this, I am putting away roughly $1665 a month into these investments (A little under 40% of my income).

I've enjoyed video games my entire life until the release of the PS4.

I remember looking for the easiest and cheapest place to live when I was going to college. I found this place for $285 a month with all utilities included. It was definitely old and dirty, but generally quiet for the amount of people that lived there. Also to say that the rooms were small, but clean. Iâ€™d say 9-10 people lived there paying roughly the same amount as me (some came in later at $300).

There was a total of 3 showers (all lined up like a gym locker room), 2 toilets on the second floor and one on the first. One full kitchen, living room, and dining in the first floor. One of the rooms was on the first. The basement was gross honestly and I never went in there. Decent amount of graffiti, but that level of grossness stayed in the basement.

The kicker was that everybody was individually paying, as I did not know any of them and honesty never got to know them. They are selling the property for $245,000. Doing the math, they were bumping everyoneâ€™s rent to $325 when I was leaving in 2018. I canâ€™t imagine it still being that low, but if it stayed at 325â€¦ thatâ€™s roughly $3,250 income monthly. 

I am 30years old now (I was an older bloke there, but not the oldest). Have a mortgage on my house with $135,000 to pay off. Have a $60,000 a year job. Have $40,000 in Roth IRA, $5,000 in Roth 401k, and $40,000 in personal SP500. Current monthly expenses are roughly $1800-$2200 without investments. 

Thoughts on me purchasing this? Iâ€™m weary why they would be selling a place that seems like promised income. Especially today where most rent in near $900 for a single bedroom. Thoughts? Dialogue?",Yes,Yes,No,Yes,No

While all 3 credit bureaus have decent fraud detection to help reduce the risk of identity theft, keeping a freeze on your credit reports prevents new credit from being opened altogether.

I'm currently interviewing at a company and am likely to get an offer. I'm a (relatively) high income earner for my area and expect this new company to have a lower cash compensation than my current employer. What this new company lacks in cash compensation, they make up for in benefits and work/life balance. I'm just having a hard time figuring out how to compare the two packages. Here are some details:

Current employer:

* Total cash compensation: $215,000 (including base pay and stock, no bonuses)
* Mid-level position
* Full medical/dental/vision
* 401k match: 2%
* PTO: 3 weeks per year (plus 1 week of personal/sick time, so 4 weeks total) plus major holidays
* No parental leave (not relevant now, but may be in 2-3 years)

Potential new employer:

* Higher level position
* Full medical/dental/vision
* 8% 401k match (drastic difference when compounded over years)
* PTO: 5 weeks per year plus major holidays

* 3 months parental leave

11cp78n,MonsieurVox,"Struggling to quantitatively compare HSA vs PPO options

Quick background: I'm starting a new job soon and have the option to choose between a plan with an HSA and a PPO. I'm well aware of the tax benefits of an HSA and have been using one for about a year or so, but I have some fairly expensive medications that are making me second guess myself.

As with most (all?) HSA plans, the cost of prescriptions is 100% until the deductible is met, then 10% copay thereafter until the OOP max is met.

With the PPO/PCA plan, approved medications are 10% copay from the beginning. The company also gives you $750 on a debit card for medical expenses (I think this is called an FSA?)

I don't recall what the OOP max is for them, but I remember them being pretty close.

Here's what I'm looking at for each plan:

||PPO Plan|HSA Plan|
|:-|:-|:-|
|Annual Premium|$1,950|$825|
|Annual Payroll Contribution|$0|$3,850|
|Annual Employer Contribution|$(750)|$0|
|Deductible|$1,500|$1,500|
|Tax Savings (24% bracket)|$(468)|$(1,122)|
|Annual medication cost (est.)|$192|$1,638|
|Total out of pocket (premium + meds)|$2,142|$2,463|
|Total savings (tax savings + employer contribution)|$(1,218)|$(1,122)|
|Net cost|$924|$1,341|

Ostensibly, the net cost for the HSA is about $400 more annually, but it doesn't feel like a fair comparison because that doesn't account for the money I'm stashing away into the HSA that I get to keep and invest. Even if it costs me $400 more per year out of pocket, my thinking is that the remaining invest-able cash that goes into my HSA should more than make up for that over time. 

I'm also not sure how to factor in doctor's appointments or things like x-rays that occur as needed, so I excluded them from my calculations altogether.

My general takeaway is that the PPO plan would be a lot easier and more convenient in the short term, but the HSA has a long-term payoff if I stick with it.

Am I missing or overlooking something?",Yes,Yes,No,No,No
129r0f6,MonsieurVox,"How do people generally save for large investments like a rental property?

**TL;DR up front: How does one save for a large investment like a rental property? Despite having a good income and net worth, stockpiling the cash required to make this purchase seems daunting without making impactful changes like changing my 401k/IRA contributions, selling investments, etc.**

For those who read all of this, thank you very much and apologies for the brain dump!

For those who have invested in real estate (or other capital intensive investment), what specifically did you do to pile up the cash? 

* How much did you save?
* How long did it take you to save that much?
* Did you keep the money in a HYSA or invest it?
* Did you stop or slow down retirement account contributions to have more cash to save?
* Did you take out a loan for the down payment? Was it a business loan, personal loan, 401k loan, something else?
* What other ""levers"" are there to pull?

For some additional context, I'm 30 years old and a pretty high income earner in my area (roughly $210,000 gross after bonuses in a decently low cost of living area). I can generally max out my tax-advantaged retirement accounts, but I want to make an eventual move out of the 9-5 lifestyle and into something like real estate. My parents own rental properties so I'm well aware of the work that goes into them and am under no delusion that real estate is ""passive income.""

Financially, I have roughly $240,000 in investments:

* $190,000 401k
* $30,000 Roth IRA
* $9,000 taxable brokerage (this is earmarked specifically for this investment)
* $10,000 crypto 

I also have:

* $18,000 in my emergency fund
* $10,000 in an I bond
* \~$120,000 in home equity in my primary residence

The absolute *cheapest* property in my area that is livable and/or wouldn't require an immense amount of rehab is around \~$200,000, so at *minimum* I'd need $40,000 to even have a shot. I'd likely need much more when factoring in the expenses that come with purchasing a piece of real estate.

Despite having a good income, I'm finding it difficult to save enough cash to be able to put down the requisite 20% for something like a multi-family home. 

I wouldn't want to take out my Roth IRA contributions, I wouldn't want to take a 401k loan, my emergency fund is right at 6 months and gives me peace of mind, and the I bond is only \~5 months old. So despite having a net worth of \~$400,000+, very little of it is actually usable without taking a hit in taxes, selling my 2.875% mortgage house, etc.

If I wanted to buy in the next year, the most logical thing that I see would be to sell the crypto, liquidate the brokerage account, sell the I bond, and set aside that \~$30k in a HYSA and continually add to it over the coming months. Unfortunately I'd be taking a loss on all of those, but that's what I get for taking a short-sighted approach.

Past that, what other things might I be overlooking? Would it be foolish to slow down 401k/IRA contributions? A HELOC seems risky, but is that a common option for folks getting into real estate?

143hk4e,MonsieurVox,"Does it make sense to convert my Vanguard funds to Fidelity funds?

To be brief, I moved my Roth IRA from Vanguard to Fidelity.

I'm about 50/50 in VIGAX and VFAIX, with both having about $17,000 invested in them ($34,000 total account balance). I bought these funds while my IRA was with Vanguard so of course didn't pay any fees at that time. 

I was considering consolidating both funds into FXAIX since there's already a big overlap between the Vanguard funds and the expense ratio is lower for the Fidelity version of the S&P 500 fund.

I want to a) double check my math and b) see if I'm overlooking anything.

* On the convert funds page, it looks like there would be a $75 fee to do this for each fund. 
* VIGAX has a 0.05% expense ratio.
* VFAIX has a 0.04% expense ratio.
* FXAIX has a 0.015% expense ratio.

Annualized, this would be:

* ($17,000 x .005) + ($17,000 x .004) = $153 in fees at Vanguard
* (34,000 x 0.0015) = $51 in fees at Fidelity if I exchanged
* $102 in fee savings at Fidelity annually (everything else equal), so roughly a 1.5 year break-even period to sell the Vanguard funds (2 \* $75 = $150)

Does that look right?

Just at a fee level, it seems like a no brainer since it's a short break-even period and it would save me thousands over the course of my retirement journey. 

There's a huge overlap in holdings between VIGAX and VFAIX, so I think it makes sense to collapse those down into one fund, and then of course VFAIX and FXAIX should be identical with the exception of interest rate.

It's obviously not a make or break decision, more of an optimization.

14c3kv9,MonsieurVox,"What does an FDIC insurance claim really look like?

Not sure if thatâ€™s the right way to ask the question, but the recent bank failures got me thinking. Hereâ€™s my scenario:

I use M1 Finance for my emergency fund and Fidelity for pretty much everything else. If M1 (as an example, could be any bank) went under and I had to go through FDIC insurance to get my money back, what would that process look like? 

How long would it take to get my money back?

How would I initiate that process?

Would I even have to initiate it or would it be automatic?

Where would insured money be dispersed if that bank shut down?

I know that, all else being equal, the money is as protected in Bank A as it would be in Bank B as long as both are FDIC insured. But is a bankâ€™s â€œfinancial strengthâ€ something that should be considered when deciding who to bank with or is it pretty much a non-issue?

166n4ig,MonsieurVox,"Does it makes sense to put in a homeowner's insurance claim for this?

A few weeks ago I was carrying a fold-able/collapsible crate down my stairs that had two buckets of paint in it from a recent bathroom remodel. As I got to the top of the stairs, the crate collapsed (go figure), and two buckets of paint tumbled down the stairs, exploding, leaving paint all over the stairs, floors, front door, and walls. After spending an entire afternoon and into the evening trying to clean up what I could, I ultimately had to make the decision to entirely replace the floors and have the walls repainted. 

I didn't even think to contact my insurance about this at the time and paid for it out of pocket using my emergency fund and some cash flow. All in, the project cost me about $10,500 (materials and labor) and my front door still has paint on it. From the date of the incident to the job being done was less than a week.

I got some pictures during the attempted cleanup, but was so busy panicking immediately after it happened that I didn't get pics immediately after it happened at its worst.

Since this was sudden and accidental damage, it *should* be covered by my insurance. I have a deductible of about $3,600, so I'd net about $6,900 if I put in a claim.

Here's why I'm not sure if I should put in a claim:

* I had literally *just* switched my insurance a week or so before the accident. Would this set off fraud alerts or anything from my insurance company? Everything is above-board, but I'd worry it'd result in an immediate non-renewal or something.
* I worry about my rates increasing significantly and having a claim on my history. I have never put in a claim on my auto/home policy, and because of that, have some decent discounts. 
* I'm not sure if this is significant enough of an incident to warrant a homeowner's claim. I'm in a fortunate enough financial position that I was able to pay for this out of pocket and it not financially ruin me.

I know that this is what insurance is for, but I always thought of homeowner's insurance as something that you only use in the case of true catastrophes (house burns down, hail storm destroys roof, etc.).

18k21mf,MonsieurVox,"With the 4% (or 5%) safe withdrawal rule, is there really a need to move to more conservative investments as you get older?

Basically the title. Assuming someone has more than enough saved for retirement â€” enough that they can withstand market downturns and not be devastated â€” does it always make sense to move those investments to things like value stocks, bonds, and treasuries as you get older?

I understand the idea in principle: Allocate a percentage of your portfolio to ""safer"" investments when you get older when you are less focused on growth and more focused on preservation. But it seems like, over time, you are leaving a lot of growth on the table that could be passed down to your children or donated to a cause near to your heart when you pass.

For context, I'm in my early 30s and am currently 100% invested in S&P 500 index funds in my retirement accounts. Have roughly $300k invested at this point. I have a long runway before retirement, so I'm not particularly concerned about bear markets or stock market downturns because I could essentially start over from $0 at this point and still be okay. Obviously we don't know what the future holds, but for the top 500 companies (or the total stock market) to collapse would effectively mean utter financial devastation for the US, would it not? In such a scenario, it would seem like *any* investment options/asset classes would be at risk.

uz4nmd,MonsieurVox,"Contributing to a taxable brokerage instead of a mega backdoor Roth - am I making a big mistake?

Hey good folks, got a question that I haven't been able to find a clear answer for. I'll first give some background, which should help clarify why I'm asking my question.


**Background**: I recently started a new job with a gross pay of around $220k. This is more than I've ever made before, and along with it came some decisions that I had to make and topics I had to research. I'm also single with no kids, I own a house, and have a paid off car. I have no other debt other than my house.

I'm maxing out my Traditional 401k (for the tax deduction) and Roth IRA. My company also allows after-tax contributions and an in-plan conversion (aka mega backdoor Roth) on those contributions. 

Since I am aiming to invest about 25% of my gross income, maxing out my Traditional 401k ($20,500) and backdoor Roth ($6,000) is gets me to ~11% of my gross income, which leaves about $28,500 on the table to invest. I also dabble in crypto but that's purely speculative and I'm not including that in my retirement percentage.

I will be 30 years old at the end of this year, and currently have about $200,000 in retirement savings; this mostly consists of a previous employer's 401k and my Roth IRA. 

Because I already have a nice chunk in retirement and am mostly taking advantage of all of the tax benefits of the 401k and Roth IRA accounts, for the last few months I have been contributing to my taxable brokerage account *instead* of doing the mega backdoor Roth for the flexibility it provides. To be specific:

1. Those funds can be withdrawn without penalty and could be used for a bridge account for early retirement 
2. I could use those funds to eventually purchase a cash flowing asset, a down payment for a rental property/AirBnB, or some other cash-flowing asset (which is a longer term goal of mine)

**This background leads me to my questions:**

* I feel like I understand the opportunity cost of not doing the backdoor Roth, but am I overlooking something? 
* Is this a terrible idea? 
* Would it be better to compromise and contribute a bit into the mega backdoor portion and reduce my taxable brokerage contributions?

I've only been doing this for a few months, so it should be easy to course-correct if this was a bad idea. Appreciate the outside set of eyes. :)",No,No,No,No,No
vv55tc,MonsieurVox,"Mutual fund vs. ETF in terms of ""buying at a discount""

Hey all, got a pretty basic question that I'm hoping someone can clarify for me. Hopefully I can word this in a way that makes sense.

When choosing between two equivalent investments in the form of mutual funds and ETFs (let's say VFIAX and VOO, respectively), holding everything else equal (fees, etc.), does it matter which type someone purchases? 

Here's what I mean. As the market goes down, the price of a single ""unit"" or share of VOO becomes cheaper. As the market goes up, so does the price of that same share of VOO. So, when people talk about ""buying at a discount,"" the analogy makes perfect sense. (Recognizing that it's an imperfect analogy.)

When contributing to the mutual fund version of what is essentially the same investment, does that same principle hold true? 

My understanding is that a mutual fund is essentially a giant pool of money that gets allocated into a variety of investments based on the purpose of the fund. In this way, you aren't exactly ""buying shares"" so much as you are contributing to the overall pool of money.

I'm probably overthinking it, and I would assume that the same idea applies to both mutual funds and ETFs, but I'm hoping someone can explain it to me in a way that makes sense.",No,No,No,No,No
x01vo7,MonsieurVox,"Looking for an automatic/friction-less budget experience

Hey good folks! Feel free to skip the context if you're not interested and go straight to the question.

**Context**

I get paid monthly and typically setup an Excel spreadsheet at the end of one month/beginning of a new month to plan out my zero-based budget. This has worked for me pretty well so far as it gives me a birds-eye view of where my money is going and how much I can safely spend. What has also worked for me is to build in a spillover/miscellaneous category that's roughly 10% of my take-home pay so it's not the end of the world if I spend a little extra on groceries, if I need to buy some clothes for a special event on short notice, etc. because there's flexibility built in.

**Question**

What I haven't been able to figure out yet is a way to automatically get a monthly report (or something similar) that shows me how closely I adhered to my budget. I know that Mint has budget alerts, but the fact that most banks have implemented MFA for login has added a lot more friction into this process. I basically have to login to each of my financial institutions several times per week or month to keep them updated which is not only tedious, but kind of defeats the purpose of automated budget alerts.

Does anyone know of a setup that is actually automatic?
 
I've heard of YNAB, EveryDollar, and Mint, but I haven't tried all of them out. Do any of them have a way to bypass the need for MFA? Is that dependent on the bank?

xn55u5,MonsieurVox,"Is there any real reason to do a backdoor Roth IRA when my company offers a mega backdoor Roth 401(k)?

For some quick context, starting this year I now make too much to directly contribute to a Roth IRA.

My company offers a 401(k) Roth in-plan conversion, aka mega backdoor Roth. This 401(k) plan is through Fidelity, and offers BrokerageLink as well as a pretty high-quality selection of preselected low cost funds. 

For the last few years Iâ€™ve contributed to a Roth IRA through Vanguard, and have been going through the steps to do a backdoor Roth IRA this year. 

Starting next year, though, Iâ€™m not really seeing any benefit to going through the hassle of contributing funds, converting them, and otherwise going through a lot of manual steps when my company offers the mega backdoor Roth option that I can essentially set and forget. 

Given the high quality 401(k) at my company, the only logical reason I can think of to do a backdoor Roth would be if I was exceeding the $61,000 limit in my 401(k), but Iâ€™m not at that point. Am I overlooking anything?",Yes,Yes,No,No,No

The options my mortgage company offers are:

1. Pay the shortage in full by end of year
2. Spread the deficit equally across my mortgage payments next year

z80tf0,MonsieurVox,"Critique my saving/investment allocations

Let me preface this that I recognize the fortunate financial position I'm in. This is truly not intended as a sort of humble-brag but I don't know of any way to ask this question without it coming across that way. 

I've read the Prime Directive and I think I'm pretty much following it to a T. My question is more about my percentages and if I may be overlooking anything to save on taxes.

I'm 30 years old. Not married. No kids. Only debt is my house, which I bought in 2019 and owe $218,000 on at 2.875%. Just had it appraised to knock off PMI and it came back valued at $340,000.

I've been at my new company for almost a year now. My salary puts me in the 35% tax bracket before deductions, 32% bracket after deductions. 

Here's how my saving and investing is broken down:

* Max out pre-tax 401k for the tax deduction ($20,500 in 2022)
   * Invested 100% in an S&amp;P 500 fund
* Roughly $10,000/year going into after-tax 401k, which will be converted to Roth at year-end (mega backdoor Roth)
* Max out HSA ($3,150, company contributes $500)
   * Just started this year. It's not invested yet as I want one year of out of pocket maximums liquid before investing. **Is this a bad idea?**
* Max out backdoor Roth IRA ($6,000 in 2022)
   * Invested 50% in a growth stock index fund, 50% in an S&amp;P 500 index fund (recognizing there's a huge overlap between the two funds and I'd probably be better off just putting it all in the S&amp;P fund...)
* $10,000 in I Bonds at 9.62% for 2022
* $1,250 per month going into my savings/brokerage
   * I have M1 Finance and my savings automatically spills over into a taxable brokerage once the dollar amount exceeds my emergency fund amount, which then gets auto-invested based on my investment allocation which is 90% funds and 10% in an individual stock.
   * The taxable brokerage is mainly earmarked as a long-term sinking fund and/or bridge account for early retirement. Long-term savings examples would be:
      * Large car down payment/paying for a car in cash
      * House down-payment (primary residence or rental)
      * Home renovations
      * Vacations
* $500/month into crypto. Purely speculative.

All in, I'm saving roughly 28% of my gross pay. The only area(s) I could see improving on would be to contribute more to my after-tax 401k OR more towards my taxable brokerage.

10% VBTLX

My 401k also offers Vanguard funds, and I am:

92% VSMPX

- **Question 3**: 

When I first graduated I hated working and gravitated to places like MMM because I wanted it to end as soon as possible. However, after job hopping, I got a job as an R&amp;D engineer in the national lab/university ecosystem. I love it, it gives me no existential dread, and this is the dream job I always imagined when I was taking high school physics. However, salary growth in this field is extremely limited from where I am. I only got to my current salary by getting competing job offers in industry and being a real hardass and showing willingness to leave.

The conventional wisdom on this sub (and /r/askengineers) is that you should hop jobs every 3-5 years, and if you didn't get a 9% raise this year you're a loser for staying at your job and you should have been interviewing 6 months ago. However, I remember what working in a corporation or small business is like and honestly it's soul-crushingly terrible compared to my current job.

However, I do want to have a house and kids and all that, and in my area, even with a nearly $100k down payment, that's a $4k a month bill, so that would be difficult for me and a spouse earning similarly to me. I don't know if I'd be able to give my kids the middle class childhood I had on my current salary and that also gives me existential dread.

It's obviously nearly impossible to follow that rule if you're an average earner looking for average lodgings in 2023. But when talking to some older people, I got a new perspective.

While many of them were able to abide by that rule, the cost of other goods was just so much more. Cars were half a year's salary or more. TVs and entertainment were significant financial purchases. Random things like barbecues, playpens for your kids, matresses, everything seems like it cost a high percentage of your salary now.

I'm not an economist, but I did come across this chart, which seems to fit my hypothesis:

https://preview.redd.it/i8ymt1dgem961.jpg?width=824&auto=webp&s=fd72e1958f8dff0da0d8d40cf8c607e0aa5f9095

And I'd assume that the trends were even more striking if you went back 50 years. It made me think that maybe we're not in such a bad situation if we're ""breaking"" the 25% or 36% or whatever rule. I can literally get a mattress, TV, game console and 5 video games for less than the monthly cost of my 1 bedroom condo. It doesn't seem like that was the reality 20, 30, 40, years ago. 

In my life today, as a single man, housing and health insurance/health care are my biggest expenses by a long shot, they just dwarf all my other spending. It's easy for me to spend very little money and be fully entertained and fed *once my shelter costs are taken care of*. If I had the same lifestyle 40 years ago, I have this hypothesis that even if you normalize for my spending, the proportion going to those big categories and other miscellaneous expenses would be quite different.

It seems that rent/house prices are some of the most subjective when it comes to a free market. The prices will literally go as high as the market will bear, and the prices will always be an arbitrary gauge as to the available salary of the population. Unlike things like TVs, there's not really a competitive aspect that will force sellers to go down.

I wonder what the effects of that are on budgeting and such. What do you think? Will this trend continue?",,,,,
12ejkke,Mother_Welder_5272,"Is it possible to thrive in this PF space if you are the type of person who has ties of some sort to path in life? And it's not so easy to change up your life to ""increase income""?

I've hung around the FI and /r/personalfinance space for over a decade. I believe I've mastered the art of how to make every penny coming in count. However, into my 30s, I'm still ""stuck"" at the $120k-ish salary range in a VHCOL. I would like to own a house with my SO, but there's no way I can afford a $4.5k mortgage for a 2 bedroom starter house as is the standard in my area. I have business ideas that would require me to quit my full time job and have no salary for over a year, which I can't pull off yet.

Whenever discussions like this come up in these subreddits, the conclusion is generally simply a cold ""increase your income"". However, that phrase is generally pretty loaded, and implies a much different life outlook. For me it's simple to read the fine print of a tax-advantaged account or sign up for Vanguard or Fidelity or an HSA or stop buying lattes in the morning or whatever.

But on the other hand, I'm a mechanical engineer, specifically working in R&D. I'm sentient and go to Reddit, so clearly I know that software engineers make so much more money and have control of the market. But being a mechanical engineer to me is something more special. It's the culmination of a childhood of Legos, Knex, Formula 1 racing, college projects, the pride of my output being a physical thing I'm happy with, rather than an abstract piece of code that converts different medical record types or makes a faceless corporation's logo fade in nicely on their website. It's the thing I've told people at barbecues that I do and I get oohs and aahs, and I feel good about myself at the end of the day. But obviously, my earning is limited. I have scoured LinkedIn, changed jobs, and gotten offers from companies in my state and all neighboring states, and usually they're not any more than I earn now. There's a fundamental part of me that feels like I'd kind of be a faceless schlub in the way I viewed myself if I just sighed, spent the few years changing fields, and went with the generic job that pays more in corporate law or business consulting or whatever.

I also know that the advice is often to move. Move to a lower cost of living area and save more. Move to a popping city where you can maximize your earnings early in life, etc... But I do have a very active social life in my current area, with a very big network of family and friends. I have constant invites to barbecues and board games, and impromptu nights that give me belly laughs so hard I can't breathe. It's a good life in that regard, and I feel privileged in that I can't relate at all to the news stories saying ""X% of Americans can't name a single friend, say they suffer from loneliness"". I think it really helps my mental health and it feels un-intuitive to leave that.

And I guess I've always just had a predilection for admiring people who have a life calling that extends beyond just making money in a faceless corporate job. For example, right now, there are startups trying to do wild work with neural implants. There's currently no active market for it, nobody is selling these to consumers. It's an industry that runs on VC money and government grants. But one day, in 2030 or 2040, when the first implant that can record your dreams to a video is commercially available for purchase, to me, the ""honor"" lies with those engineers and researchers who stuck it out for decades. Who could have ""maximized their income"" by working a generic job, and maybe even took paycuts when the VC money ran out, but they had something to get out of bed for, which resulted in something that genuinely changes the world. Thinking about being like one of those people just excites me in a way that ""Emotionlessly switch jobs every 2-3 years to maximize your income"" and ""choose a field that pays the most. The field is subject to change often, so don't get attached to any specific one"" does not. Yet it's hard to deny that being like me can limit your income, and in today's economy, maybe not even give me the standard of living with housing and leisure options that my parents and grandparents had. To me, this is a constant struggle that I'm beating myself up over. Do I ""sell out"" or do I stay the course? Are there better ways I can look at and contextualize my life? 

Are there any financial subreddits that talk about this human/mental side of saving, rather than just the dollars and cents and investment portfolios and strategies? I've gone to the therapy, but I haven't found a therapist who really satisfies what I want out of these discussions. I understand that my reasoning is seen by some people as me being a small town loser who can't realize I'm making excuses for not fully hustling and taking life by the horns or whatever. And some people think it's really nice that I have something driving me besides just money and the dream of a generic vacation at a beach resort. But I'm generally very conflicted.",,,,,

142gr9t,Mother_Welder_5272,"What are you supposed to do when you track your expenses?

I've been a long time reader of Internet personal finance, MMM, FIRE and all that. As a result, I've been maxing out my tax advantaged accounts for years and understand good retirement planning practices, have always purchased a slightly used efficient car, never paid a penny in credit card interest, etc. The one piece of advice I never really understood though is when it comes to budgeting and tracking your expenses.

People on this sub will talk a lot about how important it is to track your expenses. There's some discussion on which software is best to pull in your credit card transaction, how to organize your personal spreadsheet, etc...

I did try to track my expenses closely for a few years, but it felt like a waste of time. I pay for everything through a credit card so I have all my transactions. Every month I'd look through it and go...""yep, that's what I bought"". Groceries, internet bill, a birthday present for mom, a new air filter for the car, a date night.

 It all makes sense, I regret none of it, and I've never had a ""holy jeez I had no idea I was spending that much on that!"". I have no subscriptions that shocked me. I feel like I'm hyper aware of every dollar I spend at the moment I spend it, even with a credit card, and putting it in a monthly statement or spreadsheet form does nothing for my understanding of how frugal I'm being.

Am I missing something, or is there supposed to be more to tracking your spending? People talk about it being revelatory or good practice, but I honestly don't see the use. I feel like I can get away with just scanning my credit card bill statement for any outliers rather than getting into all this tracking software and spreadsheets.",,,,,
so332l,Mother_Welder_5272,"How exactly do Series I bonds work?

I've been seeing discussion in this subreddit about Series I bonds and how they are earning ~7%. I asked my accountant about it and he gave me an answer with jargon about how if you pull the money out before 5 years, your effective interest rate is something like 3 or 4%, but I didn't really understand it.

I read through everything here:

And I still don't see the catch. To give simple numbers, let's say the composite rate is 7%. If I put in $10k, and then after 1 year and 3 months, cash out, then the last 3 months are invalidated, but I should get a profit of $700 for the 1 year, which would get taxed. Is that right?

u8200k,Mother_Welder_5272,"When you roll a 401k into a Roth IRA, is that able to be withdrawn penalty free like regular Roth IRA contributions?

My Roth IRA has had previous 401ks rolled into it from other jobs. I know that you can pull out any of your direct contributions that you've made with no penalty. But can you do that with rolled over contributions? Or does the 401k company give the information on which parts of the funds were contributed vs. grew?

Second question, I've kept a healthy Roth IRA, maxing it out every year, to the point where over a decade later, most of the money in the account is growth money rather than contributed money. In a way, I've been ""cash/liquidity poor"" because I've been maxing out my 401k and Roth IRA since I could afford it a few years into my job when I wasn't saving for the condo I live in now.

ugg9zi,Mother_Welder_5272,"Has anyone tried ""churning"" checkings and savings accounts sign on bonuses?

uukq53,Mother_Welder_5272,"If selling one property to trade up to another, is it possible to not use the sale funds to pay off the mortgage? Example within.

For example (I'll use round numbers that demonstrate my situation), I bought a condo in late 2019 for $200k. Right now, it's worth $250k. I refinanced in late 2020 and it's a ~3% loan and I have $175k left on it. Let's say I want to move up to a $500k house within a year or so. Now, mortgage rates are higher, and I'd assume it would be 6% by the time I buy. From the order of operations here:

https://www.zillow.com/sellers-guide/what-happens-when-you-sell-a-house-with-a-mortgage/

It looks like I would sell my condo at $250k, pay off the $175k, and after fees, have something like $50k to apply as an extra downpayment or just hold as an emergency fund. However, that means I'm taking a **~$400k mortgage at 6% for the new house (assuming I also apply $50k I'd been saving for the new downpayment)**.

Wouldn't it be better to not apply any of the sale funds to the mortgage? After fees, let's say I net $225k in cash after the sale. And then just dump that all into a downpayment on the house? Now I'd have the remaining **$175k mortgage at 3% originally for the condo. And a ~$275k mortage at 6% for the new house. Even less of a principal if I apply any of the money I had set aside for a new downpayment.**

From my estimates this would give me a lower monthly payment, and have me pay less interest over the life of both loans. Basically, my thought is that I got a mortgage at a historically cheap rate, I want to keep paying that loan as long as possible and minimize any new loans. Does that make sense? Do banks and escrow and mortgage lenders allow you to do that?",,,,,
uzho6s,Mother_Welder_5272,"Is there any advice on how to reallocate your 401k in retirement, especially with this market?

As a long time lurker of this sub, I'm well aware that 99% of comments are ""My time frame is retirement, decades away! I'm not thinking short term at all!"" I agree with the sentiment, and it's what I'm doing for my own finances.

vmmg29,Mother_Welder_5272,"so how are you supposed to convert foreign cash back to USD?

wj808y,Mother_Welder_5272,"Is it ok to take money out from a Roth IRA for a house down payment if I've been ""oversaving"" for a long time? (33 years old)

I graduated college in 2011 (33 years old) and have gone from a $50k job out of college, back to school for a Master's, to a $120k job now. I've always been a heavy saver. Outside of saving up for a 20% down payment for my $215k 1 bedroom condo a few years ago, I throw everything into tax advantaged accounts, maxing out my 401k and Roth IRA as often as I can. I've usually run pretty lean with the emergency funds, just because no one depends on me and I live pretty cheap. I was single and lived a bachelor life for most of my 20s. My only other factor was $10k put into a side business that doesn't look like it's going to go anywhere in the end.

My status:

Salary - $120k

Roth IRA (with previous 401ks rolled in) - $80k

401k (been at my current job for 5 years) - $140k

I-bonds - $10k

Crypto/Brokerage Stocks - $15k

Condo Mortgage - $173k left

Condo value - probably $230-250k now

Bank checkings/savings - $15k

No other student loan, credit card, or auto debt.

I've read enough of this subreddit to know that I'm probably ""oversaving"". I only have $15k of liquid money, and maybe double that if I liquidate all my non-retirement funds (although there would be taxes for sure). The thing is, I feel like I've now been growing up a bit. I've had some serious relationships recently and could now see myself settling down in a single family house. Not now, not with anyone in particular, but maybe in the next 3-5 years. Even if not that, I was curious about keeping an eye on the real estate market and looking for a good deal on a rental property, again in the time span of a few years.

With the way houses are costing now ($500-700k+ in my area), I'm thinking that if I pulled the trigger on any of these, I'd have to have a solid $100k in down payment. Of course if I did it with a spouse, they'd probably contribute. And in that case, ideally I'd like to keep my condo and rent it out. But I feel a little behind when I see that I only have a tiny fraction of that ready.

I know that I can take contributions and rollovers out of the Roth IRA penalty free. And probably $40k of the IRA is available to take out penalty free right now. I know that all financial advice frequently tells you never to raid your retirement accounts. And that if buying a house is in your goals, you should save for the down payment before contributing past the employer match (The Prime Directive, etc...). But when I look at my net worth history chart, I feel like it kind of worked out for me. By shoveling money into the S&amp;P 500 since 2011, I've been able to make good gains on these vehicles of Roth IRAs and 401ks that can be taken out/borrowed from with no tax penalty.

If I had followed the prime directive perfectly, I may have had $100k in liquid savings, but maybe like $50k in retirement savings and have missed out on a lot of compound growth. Rather than having &gt;$200k in retirement savings and only $15k in liquid savings.

I guess my problem is more conceptual. I feel instinctively that pulling out from the retirement accounts for a down payment is ""bad"". But since I had a time scale of a decade or more before needing that big down payment, I feel like oversaving in retirements accounts, letting it grow a little, and then pulling it out, was probably the best move.

So is pulling money out of a Roth IRA or taking a 401k loan for a down payment a bad idea? Should I just revert to not contributing to the Roth IRA anymore and no 401k past match, and take til I'm 40 to rebuild a liquid checking account of 100k (at which point houses will probably be even more expensive?)",,,,,

Even if she is being risk averse and is afraid of the market, can't she just put it in a money market or fixed income account, get the $1k, and then when she graduates next year, withdraw her Roth IRA contributions from the money market account penalty-free and it would be as if she left it in her checking's account?

Lately, I've been thinking about moving to the West Coast (Bay Area) to increase my income and be closer to more opportunities, but I'm having a hard time pinning down the minimum salary increase I would need to make such a move worthwhile. Also, this is hand-on, laboratory based engineering work, so the places where I can live and find work in this field are limited with the Bay Area being a major hub.

With interest rates what they currently are and prices what they are in the Bay Area, there's no way I'd be able to buy a comparable condo, so I would have to go back to renting.

For a single filer, itâ€™s currently $66k. Between $66k-$76k youâ€™re only allowed a partial deduction. So if youâ€™re above $76k, thereâ€™s no benefit to a Traditional if Roth is still an option for you.  At the same time, if your income is low a Roth is recommended since the tax savings from a Traditional isnâ€™t all that valuable. 

So, that leaves a middle zone where a Traditional might be more advantageous. What exactly is this zone? My first guess is the range where your income tax is 22% while still below the deduction limit, so around $40.5k-$66k. Between $66k-$76k, youâ€™d do a mix between Traditional and Roth as your partial deduction limit allows. Below $40.5k and above $76k would be Roth until itâ€™s no longer an option.

Does this sound like a reasonable strategy? Am I missing anything?

PS: it was hard to find since a lot of websites donâ€™t mention it, but the partial deduction formula is fairly simple. For a single filer, itâ€™s 60% of how far away you are from $76k. So if your MAGI is $70k, then youâ€™re allowed to deduct 0.6 * $6k, or $3600. So youâ€™d contribute $3600 to a Traditional and $2400 to a Roth.",,,,,
rldbqk,Mountebank,"When to file taxes by if you want your refund in the form of I-bonds at the current rate?

So you can get an additional $5k in I-bonds if you buy them with your tax refund, but the current rate of 7.12% annualized is only valid until April 30, 2022. If you want 6 months at this rate, your bonds have to be dated in April or earlier, but how are these I-bonds dated? Are they dated based on when youâ€™ve submitted your taxes (which I doubt) or when the Treasury finishes processing the paperwork (more likely)? If itâ€™s the latter, how long does that take and how soon do you have to file your taxes to ensure it gets processed in time?",,,,,
rmxo84,Mountebank,"What's the easiest and best way to handle partial Traditional IRA deduction?

For 2022 I suspect that I'll end up somewhere in the partially deductible traditional IRA range, so I'm trying to figure out what the best and easiest way to handle that will be. It's possible that I'm way over-thinking this, but I wanted to double check beforehand. Some options:

1. Contribute 6k to traditional IRA throughout the year, then recharacterize some to Roth when tax filing time comes. My problem is that I have no idea how easy or hard this is. Is it a lot of paperwork?

2. Wait until tax filing time to contribute. This is probably the easiest, but I'd lose out on a year's worth of growth.

3. Forget the whole thing and just put everything into a Roth. With the tIRA, I'd ultimately would be saving a few hundreds in taxes right now in exchange for paying those taxes in the future, after all. Maybe it's not worth the hassle?

Another consideration is that I currently only have a Roth IRA and, hopefully, my income will grow in years to come which means that a Roth would be better once I can no longer deduct Traditional IRA contributions anyway, so the tIRA account will probably end up with only a few thousands of contributions in it. I don't think it'd be too much of a hassle to have a second IRA account just sitting there, but I don't know if that'll cause some issues in the future. I don't think so, but you don't know what you don't know, right?",,,,,

My parents got a bill from the dentist for $87 for â€œbalance forwardâ€, but when they went to ask for what it was for, the people in the office couldnâ€™t answer and just gave them the run around. The first time they went to ask, the billing person up front said that her manager was out for the holidays (this was around late December), so that they should come back in a week. My parents go back a week later, and now they say that the office doesnâ€™t have a manager at all, and when pressed they still could not say what the $87 was for. The dentistâ€™s office then suggested to ignore it while they sort it out on their end even though the due date was on the 5th of January. Well, after the 5th my parents got another letter telling them that the $87 is now past due. They called the dentist and they still say to ignore it since they canâ€™t find what service the bill is actually for and that theyâ€™ll sort it out.

sl7fdv,Mountebank,"Job is asking for people to temporarily relocate to a new facility, but the benefits havenâ€™t been decided yet

My company recently opened a new location and theyâ€™re looking to transfer people to it temporarily. Itâ€™s going to be for a year or more. Theyâ€™re rushing to get this up and running, so theyâ€™re asking for people to volunteer before the benefits for this transfer are fully decided. Theyâ€™re promising a promotion at the end of the year and some sort of housing support, but the numbers arenâ€™t available yet.

Iâ€™m tentatively agreeable to this transfer. The new place is in a lower cost of living area, and if thereâ€™s a housing stipend then I can save money on rent. The big issue for me is that Iâ€™m currently making around an extra $4/hr above my regular rate for working a non-standard shift, and Iâ€™m not sure if that will be taken into account if I take this transfer and work a regular shift there. If  hard numbers were available for the benefits then I could math it out, but theyâ€™re not. Then thereâ€™s the promotion to also take into account. That seems intangible to me since itâ€™s a startup and theyâ€™re making up the promotion ladder as they go so I have no idea what the rate increase for next rank would be.

Another issue is that even if I volunteer, I might not be selected if enough other people volunteer as well. I could give a tentative agreement, but what if that lowers my chances of being selected and the benefits end up being really good? Itâ€™s a startup so thereâ€™s no hard and fast rules for what these benefits could beâ€”theyâ€™re making them up as they go as well, but in the past they seem to be generous enough (hence my $4/hr for working a different shift).

As for me personally, I have no deep ties to either my current location nor the new one. I relocated for this job, so Iâ€™m fine with relocating again. Itâ€™s really the financial aspects that matter to me.

Before Covid, I was taking $700 per paycheck ($1400/month) towards my federal loans. Now, I just put that $700/paycheck into my â€œloansâ€ bank account ($5869). I will continue doing that until Sept 30th and then do a lump sum payment before the interest goes back. Iâ€™m in my grace period now anyway but it gives me an extra month. My mom pays off my private loans around $400-$500 a month. Once I pay off my Fed loans I plan on helping with the remainder of the private to get them gone faster. 

I have a goal of having $10,000 in my savings before I move out anywhere. I live in a high COL area and want to have a 3-6 month backup BEFORE I go out on my own. I started my job back in January so Iâ€™m hoping I can just keep pushing money in the savings account until I hit 10K.

Food: $300. I don't know how much a single person eats, I know I don't eat very much and I have a lot of experience food shopping. This is my contribution to the household food items. It would probably be less if we both contribute to groceries. 

Utilities: $150/month. For all utilities like gas/water/electric/etc. Again, my contribution. Would probably be less. 

Gas(car): $240/month 

Phone: $90 

\*Loans: $300 

Fun money: $300

Left over: $554/month 

\*Loans: I currently pay $1400 a month to really knock down my loans. When I started making payments 6 months ago, I had $20,000 in loans. I currently have $8,800 left. I will be making $1400 payment until I move out (probably August/September) and I will probably have about $5,300 in loans left. I feel comfortable lowering my payments to $300, which will still be above the minimum. Extra money at the end of the month can go to my loans/savings. 

Savings account: I currently have $6,794 in my savings account. My job expenses my mileage to/from work as well as any tolls. All this money I get expended back to me goes into my savings account. I currently drive 100 miles a day going to work and back and moving will bring it down to about 50. So, every month we can estimate anywhere from $400-$600 dollars going into my savings. I have a goal of 10k. I will probably be at around 8k, maybe more, by the time I move out. I also have about a thousand in cash. 

Am I missing anything? Are any of my estimates grossly over or under estimated? Am I being financially responsible? Can I afford to move out? 

Thanks!!",,,,,
hns6qg,Mtnrdr2,"How to track budget?

I am moving out to my own place in two weeks and I have created a budget for myself. This is my first time living on my own and I have no idea how to track a budget. I've got the budget planned out and I think it will be manageable. I've got all the bases covered: rent, food, loans, renters insurance, utilities, 401k contributions, fun money, and horseback riding. However,  I have never actually had to stick to a budget and I have no idea what the best method is for tracking it is. I tend to prefer doing things by pen and pencil, so I have been considering getting a notebook and keeping track that way. But, I feel like that could get old quick, and knowing myself, I will probably get lazy with it. I have been considering making an excel file, but have no idea how the best way to set one up, and again, laziness could make that subpar. I also got truly to try and set up a budget, but I don't know how well the sorting will be when I make a payment and if I will need to make edits and correctly sort every payment and how well it works in general.

For people who have a budget and successfully stuck to it, what was the best method of record keeping/tracking for you? Any tips/tricks and advice will be appreciated. Thanks!",,,,,
hvl3k0,Mtnrdr2,"How to save up for a house?

Hi all, 

I was wondering if anyone could offer any advice on how to save for a house. I am 24 years old and make $60k a year in a high CoL area. I currently live in an apartment with my roommate that I pay $1257 a month (an amazing price for where I live) which includes gas, water, heat, and garbage. I will probably live on my own for 3-4 years until I transfer to a different branch and will be closer to home and I will try to live at home for a year or two (2 min commute) until I can get a house but,I want a head start. My expenses are as follows:

I put 12% a paycheck a month towards my 401k. After taxes and 401k, I bring home $3000 a month. 

Rent:$1257
Internet: $13.5
Electricity: ~$40
Food: ~$250 
Netflix: $9
Gym(once it opens): ~$20
Phone (moms family plan): $90
Horseback riding: $200 
Vacation Fund: $120 

The rest I distribute to fun money, gas for car, shampoo/conditioner, etc. 

My mileage is expensed through my work. I usually get anywhere from $250-$600 a month in extra money that goes into an emergency fund. Right now, I currently have $7,600 in my savings account (1% interest, was 1.7%.. thanks covid). 
I have a goal of $10,000 in this account. By next pay check Iâ€™ll have about $8300 in there. 
Once this goal of 10k is reached, I would like to save up for a new car. I drive A LOT for my job, sometimes doing interstate travel (400+ miles away) and my car is old. A 2004 Camry with 175k on the engine. I had some engine problems recently, and although fine for driving around town,  I get nervous driving it long distance now and borrow my moms car. Iâ€™d like to get one, probably another Camry, that I can feel more comfortable in driving long distance for work. 

I feel like I have my finances under control atm. However, buying a house is a HUGE investment and I know nothing about it other than having 20% for down payment that Iâ€™ve just been able to start thinking about since my parents paid off the remaining of my loans, as a surprise, ($7800) after I already paid off $12,000. Any advice and guidance would really be helpful.",,,,,
kdo3oh,Mtnrdr2,"Question about yearly income and W2?

Hi all,
This is my first salary job so Iâ€™m not sure how this works. My salary for the year is $60,000, which is says at the top of my paystubs. Looking at the most recent paystub I have, it says that I get $2316.97 biweekly before taxes. My year to date income is $56,552.98. This includes things like ldt and std, and also my two bonuses which added up to $2500. If you take out the $2500 bonus, my year to date is $54,052.98. I get paid biweekly and my next paycheck is this coming Friday of $2316.97 before taxes, which brings my total for the year to $56,369.95 (without bonuses) and $58,868 (with bonuses). This will be the last paycheck of the year since two weeks after this Friday is January 1st. So my question is, where is this extra $3630.05 (without bonus) or $1132 (with bonus)?  

The only thing I could think of was that I started January 6th of this year. But, when I looked at the paystub for when I started, the cycle went from January 4th to the 17th and I got paid my full paycheck. So, Iâ€™d be missing $700 if I started on January 1st. 

Are situations like this normal? Are salaries based on bonuses? I thought I would have gotten close to $60,000 of salary alone and then an extra $2500. Putting me at above $60,000 for the year.",,,,,

16k32yb,Mujased,"Parent has had whole term life insurance since 2002, should she cancel?

Im a bit at a loss at what to do, my mother just approached me with some information yesterday. She has a life insurance plan that she pays monthly. The life insurance plan is the kind that, after a long period, the cash value ends up being higher than the total premiums paid.    
She started the plan in 2002, and has paid a $150 monthly premium since. The coverage is for $150K death benefit, and maturity date is 2060, so long after sheâ€™ll pass. My mom has a couple health issues, largest being diabetes, but I am hoping she will be around at least until my kids are adults, another twenty years or so, which I think is definitely possible.    
At this point, she still only has 2 years to go before breaking even, and after that, the cash value should start growing slightly faster than the premium payments. I believe something like 35k cash value at the moment.       
My parents do not make a lot of money, and no retirement accounts, they will be living off of Social Security once they retire in three years.   
They do luckily have their condo, which thanks to CA inflation, has turned into a $500K home, but they still have $100K mortgage.     
Which leads me to my questions. Should she cancel and take the cash value and invest the money?

I am 26 and I currently max out my Roth 401k ($22.5k per year). At the end of each month I have roughly $500-$600 leftover that I want to do something with, (This is exclusive of $500 per month I set aside into cash savings for emergencies which I already have $12k in)

In reality I do not have an actual purpose for this money, it is more to fill the gap because the ultra-short term and low-return of cash savings (currently 3%, but typically much lower) and ultra-long term and higher return of my 401k (2065 target date fund). But I do not need immediate access to it, and it doesn't need high returns, I just want to play with new investment instruments and diversify.

Based on the flowchart it is recommended for me to put this in a Roth IRA which I do have and had originally planned on doing, but then I started thinking, what are the conservative returns on things like Bond Indexes, Gold, etc. (various conservative investments)?

The alternative is I put the extra money onto my mortgage (3.25%) which is not much better than a savings account but would diversify me more into Real Estate vs Cash. Which also has a slight advantage of making it harder to access. I do not have a spending problem, but money towards the mortgage would be very hard to access vs money in a savings account.",,,,,

I am 26 Years Old (should retire around 2063), currently I have 50k in my 401k and it is 100% in LIWIX (Blackrock 2065 Target Date Fund) but recently I have been hearing more and more about Vanguard. I learned that Vanguard doesn't do Target Date Funds (at least not any that my 401k plan allows) but instead I could use their ""Growth"", ""Moderate Growth"", ""Conservative"", and  ""Income"" plans to basically mimic a target date fund, I would just need to reallocate between these plans over time, which is completely fine with me.

The question I have is starting now at 26 I would want to be 100% in the Growth fund which is VASGX. So would it make more sense to switch to that or just stick with my existing Target Date fund?

For a bit more detail, I am NOT considering this reallocation because of anything currently happening in the market, I know times are weird and I believe either option would work just fine for me. The only reason I am reconsidering is because of the lower expense ratio with Vanguard (0.14% compared to 0.21%), and because of any potential reviews I hear from Vanguard vs Blackrock.

When entering my deductions in turbo tax I have come to a point I'm not sure how to answer. I decided to stop driving for uber this year. My last Ride was in May. But I continued to pay for the Rideshare insurance until december because I wasnt sure if I truly wanted to quit until the end of the year. So when they ask me when I stopped working for uber is that May (my last ride) or December (the point at which I can no longer drive because I do not have the appropriate insurance)?

This also effects how many months of Cell Phone Bills and Car Loan Interest I can write off.

fi3h14,multicm,"Target Date Mutual Fund Question

I created a graph today that shows the trend of Blackrock Life Path Mutual Funds based on their target date and it shows what you would expect the 2025 fund dropped the least in the past month and the 2060 date dropped the most with a gradual gradient between.

My question is, even for the 2025 fund the drop is still significant (15% drop vs 27.5% for 2060 fund), is this typical? It seems like for people only 5 years from retirement I would not expect their investments to be this volatile.

I'm only 23 so I don't truly care much about how the 2060 fund is doing now since it will obviously recover, but I am concerned that when it is 2055 my fund could also drop by more than what I would consider safe when only 5 years from retirement.

hnw3av,multicm,"Ending a lease with a small amount of damage

My lease ends in September and due to a few different circumstances I need to move out and into a different complex. I have a dog and a while back she chewed some of the baseboards in my apartment (she was a puppy). I have done my best to repair the baseboards; wood filler, dremel and paint. Its quite good but I would understand if my apartment complex isn't satisfied.

I paid a $99 security deposit and a $300 ""Dog Fee"" at move-in.

There are 3 lines from my lease that apply here:

1. ""Resident Agrees to repair and pay for damages and costs associated with bringing the Premises back to the level of an animal free status upon move-out \[goes on to explain possibility of carpet replacement, etc. but no mention of baseboards specifically\]
2. ""To immediately pay for any injury, damage, loss or expense caused by the animal."" (Which I suppose I already screwed up since the damage was done over a year ago)
3. (Paraphrasing because this one is obvious) ""Resident will not receive the security deposit back if damage to property beyond normal wear and tear is evident""

So my question is how to I proceed from here? I in no way expect to get my security deposit back (not because of significant damage, but just because I know apartment complexes can be a bit 'difficult' at move out). But if my $99 security deposit is not enough in their eyes do I wait until my landlord says I owe money to pay them the extra? Do I go ahead and report the damage now? 

Its hard to describe the baseboard situation but the best I can say is I repaired it significantly enough that i can almost guarantee the landlord will not replace it before the next tenet moves in.

I have been with my current company 2 years and each January we are given raises between 1 and 5% based on performance (Bad, Poor, Average, Above Average, Outstanding). My first January I was given 4% and this past January my boss told me it was his intention to give me 4.5% until he found out from our HR Department that my position was underpaid based on market research. So they gave me 6% to put me in line with the Starting wage for my position (this is what my boss told me)

Now don't get me wrong I was very grateful for the raise, that means in only 2 years I have seen \~10% income growth. But I am slightly disappointed in my company admitting that they are adjusting me to the starting wage and that after 2 years of good work (being given Above Average / Outstanding reviews) I am only worth equal to the starting salary.

I should have spoken up this past January but after only being here 2 years I felt grateful enough for back to back great raises.

ibeb63,multicm,"Advice on paying for Grad School

I'll keep this as short as I can, my Grad school will cost a total of $14,000 broken down as:

Semesters 1-3: $4,000

Semester 4: $2,000

Outside of my 401k I have: $4,000 in cash and $5,000 withdraw-able (tax and penalty free) from a Roth IRA

I consider my Roth IRA to be my emergency fund for the time being (I know there will be comments saying that is a bad idea, but this is only temporary until I finish school)

I make enough money that if I live at BARE minimum I can afford to pay for each semester in cash (starting with spending all of my $4,000 in cash to start with here in about a month). So I would essentially be spending down my entire checking account and replenishing it each semester.

So my question is this, do I continue with this plan or would you recommend I go get a student loan at \~6% and rapidly pay it off?

From quick math that I did (and correct me if this looks wrong) if I were to pay the loan off in 3 years (1 year after graduating) that loan would have cost me about $300-$400 in interest.

lo7azr,multicm,"How Much House to Buy?

I know these questions are asked on here hundreds of times a day and I apologize for adding to that list...

I and 24 and currently make $66,000 a year and I currently have $13,000 in house savings for a down payment. I live in a MCOL town with ""standard"" 3/2 homes around $260k. If I don't mind a 30-minute commute I could probably get that figure down to $230k. Honestly, I do not like any of these $220-240k homes I have seen, they all feel small and dated and the apartment I rent for $900/month (my portion of rent with a roommate) is much nicer, but I want to get into the market and stop paying rent, so I am prepared to buy whatever I can afford. Based on my budget I believe I can routinely afford $1,700/month in fixed housing costs (Mortgage, PMI, HOA, etc.). That would be 30% of my income. I just want to see if that is an acceptable amount.

Few things:

1. I have very minimal debt: $70/month to a 0% interest financing credit card. And I will have $7,000 in student loans when I graduate grad school in June 2022 (I'll come back to this at the end)
2. I am currently living under a budget where I am spending $900/month on rent and saving $1,200 a month for a house and an additional $300/month in E-Fund savings. And this budget doesn't feel tight; I can continue to live like this. So That would mean once I have a house my rent+house savings of $2,100 can now be reallocated as $1,700 to housing costs and an additional $400/month to E-Fund because I know homeownership can be expensive.
3. I am single but will have a roommate (not that his rent will be used in calculating what I can afford)

On the topic of my master's degree, it may be quick to assume I should just wait the 15 months and get a house when I graduate, but there is one thing to note there. My employer has informed me they intend to give me a sizeable raise when I graduate. By the personelle policy, I will get 7% at a minimum. But they also told me when I graduate I will be promoted to ""Data Scientist"" and will be given a salary for this position as is standard in my area and industry. My research on Glassdoor has provided me with $90k as a starting data scientist salary. With my 4 years of work experience with this company, I believe I may be getting a bit more than that. But the reason I say all this is, I want a house before getting this promotion. I don't want to allow that lifestyle creep by looking at houses I will be able to afford when I am making $90k+. So I would rather get a house I can afford now and enjoy the extra income in a year. With that said, I am comfortable will going on the high range of ""affordable"" for my current budget for this exact reason.

I am not having any children anytime soon, I don't even have a girlfriend, but I got into a discussion with some family this week and I wanted to get some input from this subreddit.

Growing up I was very fortunate to have the parents I did, they are great people, but more related to the question at hand, they spent lavishly on my brother and I when we were young, Disney vacations, cruises, etc. I traveled a lot when I was a kid and I never thought anything of it financially but I knew I was fortunate. Well fast forward 20 years and I have a better picture of what was going on, my dad is in good shape but could have been in much better shape. Basically he makes good money, has minimal debt, but his retirement is less than I would have expected him to have for the money he makes. And this is all due to the money he spent when my brother and I were young. Entire vacations were on credit cards. His philosophy was he would take care of finances once we moved out, which he did, but of course minimal retirement contributions when he was younger has had a lasting impact.

I believe I was shaped, for the better, by the lavish trips we took when I was younger, I saw a lot of this country and I had a very happy childhood.

Hey guys just need mental reassurance that itâ€™s okay to spend around 1800 for an loft apartment in Omaha, Nebraska. To give you context, I can get decent one bedroom apartments for around 12 to 1400 with garages. But I like this loft and think that I can do it.

Our family will pay off our home loan this summer and the home is currently valued around 200k. We are going to enjoy no mortgage payment for a few years but may upgrade in a few years as our family grows and we have a clearer picture of our job situations.

In the foreseeable future, especially with the mortgage almost paid off, we'll have about 4-5k to invest each month. I know that the conventional wisdom is to keep feeding the brokerage account regardless of what the market is doing. However, my thought is that although the market can gain more like 7-9% on average, things look quite volatile for the next year or two with fears of a looming (or current?) recession and with HYSAs at 3%, at least I know that I am gaining, and 3% is not that bad. At least I know I'm not losing, and this past year was stressful despite trying not to check the markets very often.

I suppose the question is, in a year or two, if the market happens to do much better than 3%, would I be disappointed that I was so conservative? Maybe, but I probably won't be too bummed out since I stayed the course on the IRAs.

We contribute to a 529 education savings plan (EdVest in Wisconsin) for each of our two children. The stated state tax deduction is $3,560 per year, per beneficiary.

If I invest that amount per child, does that mean my total taxable income would reflect that amount less on my state taxes? For example, for tax purposes, it will be as if we made about $7k less this past year?

And hypothetically, if we invested more than the $3,560 (per child), we would only write up to that amount on our taxes?

Thanks for the clarification!",,,,,

Hi, I need to transfer out of my former employerâ€™s 401k plan. 

I looked at the helpful wiki post (linked below), and would appreciate someone double-checking my plan.

$4k total = $1k (traditional 401k) + $3k (roth 401k)

**My plan to transfer out:**

* 1) Transfer $1k (from traditional 401k) to my new employerâ€™s traditional 401k

I'm about to submit my 2022 taxes. What steps do I need to do to correctly report a Roth IRA recharacterization that I did in 2022 for Roth IRA contribution in 2021? Do I need to report 1099-R form on my 2022 tax return? If so how?

Context:
In 2021, I contributed 6,000 to my Roth IRA. In April 2022, I recharacterized $6,788 (contribution + earnings) to my traditional IRA (late backdoor roth ira). For my 2021 tax return, I reported $6000 on form 8606 as a non-deductible traditional contribution (filling in $6,000 on lines 1, 3, and 14 of form 8606â€”[see image](https://imgur.com/a/iKGqMCI). Also on my 2021 tax return, I wrote a statement of explanation about the recharacterization. 
Later in 2022, I did a separate ""clean"" backdoor Roth iraâ€”completed all in 2022.

Hi, Iâ€™m looking for some advice/help understanding the optimal way to use my 529 plan to pay student loans and minimize tax.

Currently, I have: 

* $40k in a New York 529 plan
* $10k in federal student loans
* Iâ€™m 27, no spouse, no kids
* Earn ~200k

I learned that distributions to pay qualified education loan repayments from a 529 plan (up to $10k lifetime) are considered nonqualified withdrawals for New York State tax purposes and will require the recapture of any tax benefits that have accrued on contributions. 
(https://www.nysaves.org/home/make-withdrawals.html)

Questions: 

1. My student loan interest resumes in September. Should I withdraw $10k from 529 plan to pay the loan off? 

2. Would I get taxed only by the NY state (and not federal)?  I think Iâ€™d get taxed at 6.25%â€”which would be $625 total for the $10k distribution + city taxes. 

3. How would I fill this out on 2023 taxes? Which reports are needed if Iâ€™m doing taxes on my own?

I directly contributed to my Roth IRA in M1Finance in 2021, however, unexpectedly, I made more income in 2021 than the Roth income limits (&gt;$140k).

M1's article wasn't too helpful as I'm also not sure how to calculate the adjusted closing/opening balance. How do I calculate this? Do these change if I made 3 different contributions?

Well, it didn't work out as planned and I was up until I wasn't.  Happens.  But now I want to replicate my savings goals from the computer into new goals.

But I was also hoping to hear from you about how you structure your savings plans. How do you plan for your leisure expenses?  Do you have several savings accounts you contribute to every paycheck? Do you simply budget a set amount every month?  Do you contribute 5-10$ every time you forgo a typical expense like a coffee or a planned lunch?  Do you contribute to your account when you buy the less expensive version of something you really wanted?

Let me know.  I'd love to hear from you.",,,,,
oh75xu,Nblearchangel,"My FICO score dropped 51 points in one report


And the only reason that I can see is because I was maxed out on my personal line of credit through Wells Fargo for something like 11 days. I have a line of credit for $800 and I maxed it out last month because I needed some funds to tide me over for a few days, and I noticed I got charged five dollars interest even before my month was up. Regardless, I paid it off as soon as I got paid on my next paycheck and it was paid off well before 30 days was up. 

Fast forward to today where I checked out my FICO score through my Wells Fargo app and noticed a decline. I hopped on credit karma and the only alert that I could find was an alert regarding the personal line of credit being overdrawn by five dollars.  There were no other notifications or any delinquent payments.

p8ehzu,Nblearchangel,"Interviewing at multiple firms and I need to set priorities

Currently, my existing employer is talking about promoting me but I put in some apps several weeks ago. Iâ€™m 35 and unsatisfied with career prospects where I am now because management just doesnâ€™t know how to develop people. Itâ€™s a young firm. 

The promotion theyâ€™re proposing would be from an entry level role to a management role. A big jump for sure, however, Iâ€™m extremely uncertain how much theyâ€™ll be willing to pay me. Based on expectations Iâ€™d be making less than I could make elsewhere but I definitely wonâ€™t be able to get manager on my resume anywhere else. 

Thing is, Iâ€™m finally hearing back from those apps I put in. Iâ€™ve heard back from two in particular both of which are massive companies, Salesforce and Deloitte, and I imagine Iâ€™d get proper career training/development at either. The only things I learn in my current role are things I seek out on my own, and even then the learning opportunities are sparse. Thereâ€™s just so few resources where I am. 

Iâ€™m jumping the gun a little and I havenâ€™t gotten an offer at either place but I want to leverage this opportunity. Do I wave an offer letter around to my boss demanding more than they planned on paying me?  In the event I get an offer I imagine it would be significantly higher than my new promotion would pay. And the thing is, once I get locked into my new management role there wonâ€™t be any pay growth for a very long time. They donâ€™t exactly do COLAâ€™s where I am. Lol

I know this is a bit broad but I was hoping to hear some perspective from people that have been in similar situations. The WLB where I am now is unparalleled but I have so much debt. Soooooo much debt and I need more income. I donâ€™t want to be a slave to this forever. So with that in mind, what are your thoughts?

TLDR: Current job wants to promote me to manager but I may have offers from much larger firms for much more money soon as Iâ€™m currently interviewing places.

To skip my back story, last year I made life changing money for my family, and I have really started to resonate with Dave Ramsey (donâ€™t know the general consensus anymore for him, but whatever).

Problem is, with our income last year, we jumped all the way to the end goal and now I have to figure out how to work backwards.   
  
To be brief, the only debt we have is our two vehicles (combined loan value of ~$69k, both brand new), a camper ($11k) and the house mortgage ($150k @ about 3.5%); outside of this, we are debt free (credit cards paid monthly, etc)

$120k 401k
$500k HYSA (money market)

401k:  Just became eligible last month with my new employer and started with a contribution of 12%, which is going into a Vanguard 2035 target date index fund.   This works out to a 401k contribution of $15,600 annually

This is a two person firm and one of the persons is degreed in accounting but not a CPA and the other ""specializes in IRS audit representation for individuals and businesses"".  Both have over ten years of tax accounting experience and their Yelp reviews are all from individuals who say they did a great job with their taxes.

Firm #2:

XYZ Tax and CPA Services

Fee estimate: $600

This is a larger firm with some CPAs showing on their roster and some tax accountants with Accounting majors.


I *think* my returns should be pretty straightforward but am new to this and want to make sure my deductions are maximized.  Is there any benefit to paying the extra $300-$350 to have a CPA'd firm?  That's a pretty big difference and I'm not sure which direction I should go.",,,,,

I was in an automobile accident a couple of years ago that led to a mountain of bills that were paid by my insurance until my PIP was exhausted.  Once I exceeded my PIP I made payment arrangements on the other bills.  I just ran my three free credit reports for the first time in a while and there are two reports from a local collection agency from an imaging center that were legitimate charges, but these must have somehow slipped under the radar.  These two charges total less than $300 total.

uj8wq3,NinoZachetti,"Game plan to help pay for kids' college

Background:  I'm an early 50s divorced male with two kids that will both be off to university late this summer.  There are no savings specifically earmarked for our kids' education and all of our assets were divided equally in our divorce a few years ago.  Here's my current financial scenario:

*I own a home worth $2 million with about $285k left on my 3.125% 30-year mortgage.  My monthly mortage payments are about $1,300/month.

*I have about $180k in my Schwab retirement account allocated mostly to target date 2035 index funds (SWYFX).

*I own my car and have no other debt other than normal monthly expenses.

*After paying taxes last month I have about $20k remaining in cash in a bank money market account that is there to cover monthly expenses and serve as an emergency fund.

*I started my own LLC a year ago and make around $100k per year.  My first client is having significant supply issues so my contract with them is extremely unstable right now.  I updated my resume today and am going to begin looking for new client(s) immediately.

*I realize that I am not well-positioned for a normal retirement horizon right now and that I'll likely have to sell my home at some point to be able to do that.  I live in a metro area where real estate is absolutely insane, so I view my home equity as my eventual retirement, not the modest about I have in my IRAs.  I live well within my means, haven't been on a real vacation in many years, drive a 2011 Chevy with low miles, shop frugally, dine out rarely, etc.  I am very happy with what I currently have and my home is my happy place.

My ex and I have met with the financial teams at each of the universities that our boys will be attending.  Both will be taking the maximum federal student loan amounts of $5,500 and we have enough GET units to mostly cover each of their first semesters.  My parents are going to be kicking in $2k each which I will deposit into bank accounts that I will establish for each boy and will use this money for payments to the schools.  Beyond that it looks like there is a gap of approximately $5,000/month over the college months total between the two, so we're going to have to come up with a game plan to close this gap.

Assuming a 50/50 split of this burden between my ex and me, and also assuming that I accept this burden, that's $2,500/month that I will be on the hook for, and I don't have that kind of pad in my earnings.  The Parent Plus loan is one option, and I've also begun brainstorming others such as a private loan, line of credit, or HELOC.  Given the interest rate on my mortgage compared to current market I'm guessing that a cash-out re-fi isn't going to be an attractive option for me.  Though we likely won't be having to make any significant payments until the first of next year (as a result of our GET units), I'm motivated to begin making decisions on this now as a result of my LLC client being very unstable.  If a worst-case scenario happens and my client doesn't renew my contract with me and I have difficulty finding a new client I don't want any lending institution refusing my loan request as a result.

So I'm trying to decide what to do here and am experiencing a lot of anxiety about this.  I knew college was going to be expensive but I didn't anticipate this much of gap between their federal student loans  and overall total cost.  I would be very appreciative of any advice given to me for the best game plan to move forward.

p5nlca,No7onelikeyou,"New to investing! Roth IRA vs Taxable account question

Hello! I donâ€™t know everything, not even close, so please excuse me if this is an â€œeasyâ€ question to answer. 

When it comes to investing long term, most think maxing out a Roth IRA is fantastic, due to the tax benefits, especially when someone is a little older and can take it out completely tax free (59 and a half years old). 

Due to the annual contribution limit, is it designed to be that way? As far as the big compound interest not really taking effect until years and years. Why is there a limit anyway? They donâ€™t want someone having too much? I mean isnâ€™t a $6k limit per year small? Once someone is 50 then it goes to $7k, but I mean thatâ€™s at 50 years old.

Anyway, I was then looking up info on a taxable brokerage account, from my understanding, there is NO contribution limit. Talk about a night and day difference! Despite the taxes. 

Since time is HUGE when it comes to investing, isnâ€™t it best to put in as much as possible, with as much time left as possible? 

For these two examples, $180,000 is the total. I used a compound interest calculator at investor.org. 

$0 initially. $500/monthly for 30 years at 8%. Just over $679,000 is the total after all that time. Thatâ€™s for $6,000/year

Compared to $180,000 at once. As well as $0/month, for 30 years at 8% as well, the total comes out to be over a million dollars more lol 
. A little bit over $1,811,000. 

So despite the taxes, would it be best to put in as much as possible into a taxable account due to the compound interest and time? Where as even with taxes, the amount â€œtake homeâ€ would still be higher? 

If someone can invest $15,000/year...instead of $6,000/year in to the Roth and $9,000 into a taxable, wouldnâ€™t they be better off putting in all $15,000 in to the taxable? Not as beneficial tax wise, but how do you factor in the amount being much higher since so much is being put in, with the compound interest going crazy even early on, especially then with so much time left? 

A Roth IRA sounds great, but is someone better off putting in more elsewhere, thanks to it being a higher total amount compared to dividing up among accounts?

Earned income is needed for a Roth IRA, compared to not being needed for a brokerage account. I just donâ€™t really understand how it works since the $ for a Roth IRA doesnâ€™t always come from someoneâ€™s job?

My paystub should say I worked 21 hours @43.956/hr =$923.07


Instead it says:

Regular: 24hrs @ 21.98
Overtime: 12hrs @32.97

Total: $923.07

While the total amount is correct Iâ€™m concerned about why they processed my pay in this way. There is also ambiguous language in the employee handbook that makes me think I will only accrue
hours during my â€œregularâ€ hours worked and not OT. That would still be fine if it wasnâ€™t for the fact that the payroll person told me whenever she puts in a day for PTO the system takes out 12 hours of accrued PTO. 

That only makes sense if both my regular and OT hours accrue at the same rate. 

The payroll person called it the 80/40 rule. She mentioned thereâ€™s a handful of us salaried workers who are treated this way and that it was explained to her at some point but she still doesnâ€™t get it.

I donâ€™t get what the point of this system is. How does it help the company? And if it helps the company is it at the expense of my PTO?

The administrator called the corporate payroll person and left a message. Heâ€™s supposed to call us in when they call back for a meeting. 

What questions or concerns should I bring up? 

Im wondering if they are changing my clock in and clock out times to jive with the amount of hours my paystub is claiming I worked. Or am I getting ripped off on pto? We ran into another employee who is treated as 80/40 and she is confused herself. She also seems to believe that when you file taxes you get more taken out from overtime pay.

o6opip,NoGimmicks,"How to factor rental income in determining how much house one can afford?

My partner and I current pay $7200 a year in rent and are aiming to save $40k a year specifically for a down payment. This equates to us ""spending"" ~$4500 a month in housing. Theoretically we could afford a $4500 a month mortgage, but we want to minimize risk in case of job loss or expensive emergencies. We plan on putting 20% down on a 30-year mortgage, but try our best to pay off early.

&amp;nbsp;

There are a few scenarios that we are considering and could use input on:

&amp;nbsp;

(A) 800k singe family = ~$3900 monthly mortgage payment. We would save $600 a month ($7,200 a year) from our current housing rate for emergencies/paying off early. 

&amp;nbsp;

(B) Single family home for $650-750k =mortgage of ~$3500 a month. We would save ~$1000  a month ($12,000 a year) from our current housing rate for emergencies/paying off early. 

&amp;nbsp;

(C) Two family home for $800k-900k. = ~$4300 monthly mortgage payment. 

&amp;nbsp;



The average rental price in my area for a 1BR is $2000. If we estimate charging $1800 a month for rent and occupancy 9 out of 12 months a year we would have $16,200 of rental income. 

We would also still be saving $200 a month ($2400 a year) from out current housing rate.

That equals $18,600 a year for emergencies/paying off early.

From my calculations it seems like scenario C gives us the biggest emergency cushion/ability to pay off the fastest.",,,,,
o9u5rn,NoGimmicks,"My parents have a severely underfunded retirement account but own and live in an income producing property. What's the best plan for retirement?

My parents have less than $20k in retirement accounts and ~$25k in savings. They took out a $30k loan from family to pay off the house a couple of months ago. Based on their previous mortgage payments, property/rental taxes, I calculate they will now be netting $20k a year from the rental income. 

My dad has always worked physical jobs and has recently been having knee and back issues. He is ready to retire yesterday, but his goal is to hang in there 2 more years. I am thinking he should use those two years of full-time work to open and max out Roth IRAs for himself and my mom. If all goes according to plan in two years the $30k loan will be paid off while maxing out the Roths. After that he can transition to a part-time job or a full-time job that is less demanding so he can continue to max out the Roth IRAs and the rental income will pay for regular bills.

Five years from now he will be 60 and my mom 63 and they will have a paid off house, $70k in their Roths (+ growth hopefully) and my two younger siblings that live with them now should be starting their own careers be able to survive on their own by then.

They can then sell the house which is currently valued at $1.28 million on zillow and the owner of the house next door offered $900k 3 years ago without even stepping inside. Barring a huge market crash in the next 5 years they may be able to sell for $1mill and buy a single family home in a lower cost of living area for under $300k. After closing costs, fees, taxes, etc I'm hoping they have at least $550k leftover. 

**What kind of tax implications are there if they took that $550k and stuck it in a taxable brokerage account all at once and began to withdraw from it annually for retirement ?**

If they have $600k at retirement (taxable account + roth + tiny 401k) and follow the 4% rule they will have $24k a year to live off of to start. I think they can manage with a paid off home and no other debt. There will also be some sort of social security coming in and with three children we can help fill in the gaps if we have to.

Any suggestions or criticisms of the plan are highly appreciated!

Edit: The house is over 100 years old and they have been lucky that there really has only been one major issues in the 21 years of ownership.

This week I will be starting a part-time job of 12-15 hours a week and itâ€™s unclear if it will last more than 2 months although my goal is to be working somewhere part-time for the next year or two. 

Should I be updating my W2 at my full-time job to declare a second job even if itâ€™s expected to be short-term? If it becomes long-term do I then definitely need to amend my W2?  At my part-time job I filled out the W2 yesterday and checked off the â€œ2 jobsâ€ option but didnâ€™t add any details. 

What would be the tax consequences of not updating my W2 at my main job? Would I owe money at the end of the year or would I get a bigger refund?

As long as I donâ€™t owe the IRS money at the end of the year Iâ€™d rather not inform my full-time job I have a second job until I know it will be long-term.",,,,,
qqv9lq,NoGimmicks,"My bonus check did not have federal tax withheld.

I have a part-time job in addition to my full-time job and I noticed this morning an unexpected deposit. 

Checking the payroll app it turns out to be a bonus check. However only social security and Medicare taxes were taken out. $41.42 out of $541.42. That appears to be the correct 7.65% taken out. 

My suspicion is that the company wants to make it seem like they are giving out a generous $500 bonuses to everyone so they chose to not have the federal tax withheld. 

Am I correct in setting outside 22% of $541.42 aside to pay the tax man when itâ€™s time to file?",,,,,
re8fei,NoGimmicks,"I'm worried my new student loan provider will increase my monthly payments based on my new income. How can I keep my payments low?

**TL;DR** at the bottom  

I currently owe $18,200 in student loans. No car payments, mortgage, or credit card debt. I have ~$4000 set aside for student loans and contribute $300 weekly to that account, so in one years time I should have $19,000+ and be able to pay off the loans in full.

The reason I'd rather pay it all off at the end of year rather than making large monthly payments throughout the year is that my emergency fund is very depleted and I would feel more secure having access to cash from the student loan account until I can rebuild my emergency fund. I also would prefer to max out my Roth contributions earlier in the year.

When I originally did my income based loan repayment questionnaire I had just started working full-time in my field and was not making a lot of money. Since then I've had a $30K salary increase and my expenses are lower since my fiancÃ©e and I live together now.

My discretionary income will also appear higher because I took on a part-time job in July of this year. That income is strictly to pay for the wedding, but I doubt that is something I can specify to the loan service provider.

**With payments starting up again I am worried that if I select an income based repayment option my monthly payments will substantially increase. What would be the best repayment plan to keep monthly payments low?**    

***Side Note:***  

My emergency fund is usually in a healthy state but this year I heavily tapped into it as I started off the year unemployed, bought an engagement ring, opened up a Roth IRA for the first time and maxed out 2020 and 2021 contributions. I should be able to restore it back up to normal in the next 7-8 months.

**TL;DR:** I've had a significant salary increase and am afraid a income-based repayment plan will result in a high monthly payment. I will have the ability to pay of my loan in full in one year, so I am looking for a way to keep my monthly payments low until then.",,,,,
rlml8n,NoGimmicks,"Buying a house in two years, should I be concerned about the effect of paying off my student loans early, number of new credit cards, and having two new jobs?

Sorry in advance for the long post!

As of today my credit scores are 797 from Transunion, 781 from Experian, and 794 from FICO. 

My oldest account is 13 years and my average account age is 3.7 years.

My credit report shows 5 recently opened accounts on my reports. I opened 3 credit cards in 2021 and 1 account in 2020. My fiancÃ©e opened  an account in 2020 on which I am an authorized user so it shows up on my report as well.

On Experian when I opened three credit cards this year within 3 months of each other my credit score went from 794 to 733. Its since made its way back to 781. FICO and TransUnion took dips too but don't have those number available. They are back in the high 790s now.

I have a total of 12 total accounts which includes two student loans that have opening dates of Sept and Feb 2017. My plan is to pay them both off early. December 2022 is the goal.

**I am concerned that because my average account age is only 3.7 years if I pay off my student loans and those two accounts are closed than my credit score will drop significantly. Will ~1-1.5 years time be enough for it bounce back? And/or will the improvement to my DTI outweigh the potential drop in credit score?**

Ideally I also want to open one more card in January 2022. This would be the last card I ""need"" to maximize my cashback. I'm a person that spends less with credit cards than cash and once I call and downgrade my CSP card after the first year, none of my cards have annual fees. If the lookback period for ""recently opened cards"" is two years than this last card should fall off by January 2024. 

I am getting married in May 2022 so I took on a part-time job to cashflow wedding/honeymoon costs. I am unsure if I want to continue with the job after the wedding and I'm not sure if it may hurt my mortgage application. My part-time job was my full time job from August 2017-October 2020 (although my first year was at 1 location and then years 2-3 was at another location with separate payroll). I left in October in 2020 and returned in July 2021 as part-time.

**I've read that banks want to see 2 year of employment, if I took a break from the part-time job after the wedding would it hurt me if I haven't reached two consecutive years of employment by the time my wife and I are applying for a home loan in 2024? Does the fact that its my part-time job and not full-time make this question moot?**

I started my full-time job in March 2021 after being unemployed from October 2020-February 2021 and anticipate remaining with my current employer until mortgage time.

Regarding my DTI, its currently at 9% when only factoring in my full-time salary and no student loan payments. When payments restart it'll be ~13%. With the part-time job factored in then my DTI improves.

Once I'm married and the student loan is paid off our combined DTI would be ~8% or better depending on if I'm working part-time or either of us gets raises.

BTW I hope I'm calculating DTI correctly. As I understood it the only debt I have is rent + student loans. Don't have any car or personal loans and all credit cards are current.

My fiancÃ©e is in good financial shape- high credit score, no debt, and high income, so there's no concern about applying as a married couple. 

I feel like I may be overthinking all these numbers but would appreciate confirmation from all of you!",,,,,

enaaj3,NoHinAmherst,"Advice for my M-I-L: Rent or Buy

My mother in law is at a crossroads. She got out of a bad situation where her husband unexpectedly died without insurance, leaving her in a huge house with hundreds of thousands of dollars of debt, including $50k on credit cards, a new car loan, and liens on the home. Sheâ€™s 70 and collecting social security, but also working, making ~$45,000 a year.

She got out of that mess, sold the house, used the equity to pay down debt, and eliminate the liens, paid off half of her car, and rented a home by paying for a year in advance. The year is almost up and she has to decide: rent or buy?

Her monthly from SS is $2,500. She has $10k remaining on the card, but is floating that to keep her liquid assets until she makes this decision. She has $80,000 in the bank. Her rent is too much ($2,000), but she wants to buy a home thatâ€™s $300,000 (I canâ€™t convince her to look at houses for less) and use $60k down to lower the payment and avoid PMI.

I like the idea of her buying simply because if she runs out of money she will have the equity rather than some landlord, but thereâ€™s something to be said about not eliminating that lump sum of liquidity. Renting for a number of years will probably never put her in the position to own again, but she will have emergency money. Sheâ€™s in fine health, but sheâ€™s 70. 

Input and ideas are requested by my wife, as sheâ€™d be her real estate agent (saving $$ by not having her pay a commission!) and wants the best for her mom.

And of course, the wife wants a new kitchen (quote: infinity...ignore this portion).

Iâ€™m looking for feedback about what things to look out for when asking around, what tricks I should avoid if I consider a refi or second mortgage or HELOC.

Some info: 
- My mortgage rate is currently 3.5%. I have 26 years remaining, though I had been paying it as a 15 year.
- We plan to live here forever, though thatâ€™s dependent upon work.
- My credit is 806-849 depending on the agency.
- My mortgage owed is about $300,000 on a $409,000 mortgage and the home value average estimate is around $460,000.
- No debt other than the mortgage and my car payment of $360 which ends in two weeks!
- Liquid capital: $70,000 (7 month safety net).

I could just as easily leave all of these repairs and improvements until the wheels fall off, Iâ€™m not itching. I just donâ€™t want to miss an opportunity to make these repairs when my credit is high and rates are low, when it could cost me a lot more at a later date.

Ideally, Iâ€™d like to get the magical scenario where my payment is the same or close to what it is now, due to a lower rate, but also put equity to use to fix and update the home.

ok73h1,NoHinAmherst,"Looking for a solution to a stupid problem I created with the IRS

This tax year was different for my family, as it was for many others. I typically owe money at the end of the year, but due to a loss of income during the pandemic from my wife who is a real estate agent (1099-NEC) and suddenly had to spend much more time working out of the house with our two kids, we were owed a refund. My refund was something like $5,606 and, as it turns out, this matters.

I filed early, around Feb or March, and my return was accepted. I file with multiple states, so I always check my bank accounts to make sure that the refunds come in and just as importantly, the checks owed to another state were cashed by that state. Within two weeks, I saw a direct deposit of $5,606 and that my MA check was deposited. Great! But then a couple weeks later I noticed that the IRS deposited $3,727.94 a day or two after my refund AND another deposit of $1,873.06 around a week later.

What were these two amounts? My taxes were complete, and these random totals were confusing. Refunds should be rounded to a dollar amount anyway, so why the $0.06 or $0.94? Those add up to a dollar! Wait, those two checks add up to $5,600 when combined. Did the IRS just pay me twice? Am I about to get a third check for $6?

A Google search told me that sometimes the IRS might make a double payment by mistake, and if that's the case, you better not keep it. They may take a long time to notice, but when they do, you'll owe it WITH INTEREST AND FEES. No thanks; I did my taxes, I filed on time, and I'm not going to find out next year that I owe the IRS this money back, plus more, because of their mistake.

First, I called my bank and asked if the IRS could or would just pull the money back and was told that's impossible. Then I called the IRS (imagine the amount of time on hold) and spoke to someone in the refund department who could not confirm that I'd been paid twice. We also wondered about the missing $6. Why was the double payment in two checks? Why did those add up to $5,600? Why not $5,606? In the end, she suggested that I call my bank and have them reject those two checks, assuming another $6 check would arrive in the future -- at least it wouldn't cost me much of anything in interest when it arrived. So I did.

Is anyone reading this in a family of four, with two dependents, earning an AGI under the limit to qualify for the stimulus, yelling at me for what I did? That's right, I returned my $1,400 per person stimulus check, for joint filers with two children. I still have no idea why they broke it into two random-sized checks and don't know when or how or if the backlogged IRS will send the money back.

The last few years Iâ€™ve been doing the mega backdoor Roth and moving the post-tax funds all together when I reach my employers post-tax limit of $10k. Usually this has happened after Iâ€™ve already maxed out my own pre-tax contributions  

I messed around with my bonus contributions and itâ€™s going to end up that Iâ€™ll have maxed my post-tax 401k contribution limit of $10k next month, and my pre-tax contributions will still take another few months to reach $20.5k limit. 

Iâ€™m pretty sure the answer is yes, but can I convert the mega backdoor funds before reaching my pre-tax limit?

1. Is this coverage typically per account or per user - so if I opened two accounts at fidelity would I still be capped at $500k, or would it be up to a million?
2. Is it common practice or recommended to open accounts elsewhere solely for this reason if account portfolios get too big?

Per fidelity: The Securities Investor Protection Corporation (SIPC) is a nonprofit organization that protects stocks, bonds, and other securities in case a brokerage firm goes bankrupt and assets are missing.

I'm moving for work from a LCOL area to a MCOL/HCOL area in a few months. I've got good income ($180k), decent amount of liquid cash for a downpayment ($85k) and additional stocks ($700K) and retirement funds ($400k). I have no debts at 31 and its just myself. 

I currently rent for $1350 a month in my current city, and was planning to buy a house in the new city. I looked at a few places, didn't love anything so never ended up making any offers, and figured I'd at least rent for a bit and get a feel for the new city a bit more. I was a bit bummed because with house prices going up everything in my price range was in the suburbs or a cookie cutter townhome. I considered upping my price range but something I'd like would be around $700K and I couldn't see myself justifying a place like that for just myself 

Looking at rentals in the new area I'm probably up to $2300 for somewhere I'd like to live. I don't love the fact my rent would be almost doubling by moving, but mentally just offset it by saying theres no state income tax where I'm moving so I'll have more take home (not a wash, just a make myself feel better). 

When I look at the rental costs it kind of makes me reconsider some of those non-ideal home options such as the townhomes. The mortgage would be a little bit more than rent but I can still afford it. I don't have a strong NEED to own a home or anything and have enjoyed renting relatively hassle free and being able to move around freely. I think I'm still set on planning to rent because my new role there's a decent chance I get moved in another year or two.

With housing prices going up would be interested to hear if there's any other considerations for the rent/buy option in my situation as a potential first time buyer.

All of our other money goes into our brokerage which is 60/40 for passive income.  Even though we have the money to pay for everything, I like to borrow 40% of my portfolio at 2% and slowly pay that off so I can keep my money invested as well as building up my account for more passive income.  I guess the bonds reduce the volatility with borrows.

**INCOME**

My income: 75k

Wife's income: 60k \*She is staying home this year to be with the kids, returning Fall 21. We consider her income as ""disposable (saving) income,"" and don't want to rely on it for housing payments/bills.

If we went for 20% on a house, we'd nail the student loan debt away as soon as she returned to work.

**STUDENT LOAN SITUATION**

30k federal student loans. Interest rates: 10k @ 6%, 6k @ 5%, 14k @ 3-3.5%.

**HOUSING IN NEW HAMPSHIRE**

Current ""month to month"" Rent: $1,300 (expected to rise - unsure by how much)

Payment with 20% on 300k (30yr): $1,500-$1,600 month depending on town's taxes

Payment with 10% on 300k (30 yr): $1,800-$1,900 month depending on town taxes and includes PMI

**HOUSING MARKET**

Moved here in summer of 2017 thinking things were overpriced and we'd wait and try and buy in the 250k range. Boy were we wrong. COVID made everything worse and everyone is flocking to NH. Most ""starter"" homes are beyond 300k currently. For example our friends bought in 2015 @ 250k and their house is now worth 350k no improvements.

Offers are currently 30-50k over asking, and waived inspections. We've been outbid on waived inspections the past 3 years (3 bids total as we've been picky/patient).

\--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**FINAL THOUGHTS**

I personally lean towards doing 20% as the monthly payment on a house is less daunting. Either way, when my wife returns to work we'd nail away the debt or build back to 20% as fast as possible. I guess I just worry with the current housing market that unless we have 20% we just don't stand a chance.

Thereâ€™s a lot of social pressure for everyone to buy a house when they can. I was currently planning on buying one soon as well but now Iâ€™m having second thoughts about doing so.

Iâ€™m currently a 25 year old single guy. My total gross annual income is about $110-120k. I expect to get promotions every couple of years or so for the next decade or so so my compensation should grow about 5-10% a year on average until my mid thirties when promotions will become less frequent.

I currently have about $250k saved up. $150k of that is in a taxable brokerage account and the rest is in retirement accounts. I currently save about $50k/year including all employer matches and incentives.

So I feel like financially I can buy a house especially if I save for another year or two, but Iâ€™m not sure if I want to yet.

I really enjoy where Iâ€™m renting now. I really donâ€™t have anything negative to say about my apartment and the community Iâ€™m renting in has a lot of great ammenities and neighbors. In addition, I moved into my current place in the middle of the Covid shutdowns so I got a great rent rate.

I really wouldnâ€™t mind living here for a few more years at least.

My next argument is that if I bought one, I would need to use most of my liquid net worth for down payments, closing costs, and initial repairs and renovations. I feel like the opportunity cost for doing so will be huge down the road. I can easily triple my net worth or more by the time Iâ€™m thirty if I keep saving $50k/year like I have been and the market grows 10%+ year.

This small regional bank has some nice things going for it. Theyâ€™ve consistantly grown their business over the years. Theyâ€™ve benefited in a positive way from the PPP business loans, most of which wonâ€™t be paid down early as companies seek flexibility. They have a ~3% dividend, and typical issue a 5% stock dividend each year. They have a price to earnings around 6 right now. Theyâ€™re around the same stock price they were 3 years ago when they were making half as much annually. Finally, my personal favorite, I contacted their investor relations and the CFO emails me back with answers within 24 hours. I love small businesses where people wear multiple hats, and this place must have hired at least *one* guy who likes to work.

Edit: 
1. Thank you for the guy researching the temperory impact of the PPP loan and placing it around 100 Mil in loan growth through the program, referencing that most growth has been non PPP in 2020. This makes sense as there were a lot of restrictions with the PPP (limit on company distributions for instance) making it a less desireable option for business owners if you could get something elsewhere. 

2. Someone brought up an acquisition potentially capping the value of the stock. Funny thing with that is that there are two â€œLandmarkâ€ banks, this one and one on the east coast.

poalt5,ORCoast19,"Thoughts on investing in energy &amp; inflation with OXY/WS?

Iâ€™ve been buying OXY/WS this month, kicking myself for not buying them a year ago when I first learned of them. OXY/WS is the cheapest way to invest in OXY if you believe the share price will go up significantly. They essentially give you the right to buy shares at $22 plus the current warrant price. You have up until Aug 3 2027 to exercise this right. These warrants were issued to OXY shareholders during hard times in 2020, to throw them a bone, but I imagine most bailed as the stock collapsed. 

Four reasons I like this play areâ€¦

1. Rising Free Cash Flow. Occidential petroleum has been benefiting from an increasing WTI crude oil price, hovering around $70/barrel as of today. Last quarter it averaged around $65/barrel, and they had cash flow in that quarter above 2 billion (market cap is currently ~24.4 billion for reference). Cash flow should continue to increase as crude price increases, and they work to pay down their crippling debt.

2. The Crippling Debt is Going Away. No one likes debt, right? Especially crippling debt that might bankrupt you in a sudden, extreme downturn? *cough* Covid 2020 *cough*. Apparently management got the message that their debt load could kill them, and have a plan to reduce debt by over 40%, planning to drop from 34 billion in debt at the end of 2020 to 20 billion in debt at the end of 2022. As debt gets paid down the current interest payments of 300+ million/quarter will reduce to under 200 million/quarter, adding over half a billion extra to their free cash flow!

3. Inflation Hedge. OXY has a lot of hard assets, and if US inflation takes off their stock should rise. An example of these hard assets can be found in their land holdings- they own over 1.35 million acres in the permian basin alone. If inflation is high over the next 6 years, I feel the time value of OXY/WS is being very underappreciated. As of today that time value is under $6 per warrant. 

4. Future Energy Needs. Going back to the permian basin, the land that oxy has might one day be reused for alternative energy. Believe it or not, massive solar projects can hit a wall due to environmental groups. Belowâ€™s a link of this issue recently cropping up in San Diego County. For some reason, I donâ€™t think Texas will give a damn about environmental issues, making that previously mentioned 1.35 million acres in the permian basin prime real estate for massive solar projects. In addition to solar potential, OXY has also been working on CO2 sequestering using their pre-existing oil drilling footprint.

Hey Everyone, 
I wanted to get folks opinions on NWN. NWN is a natural gas and water utility provider based primarily in OR and WA. P/E at todayâ€™s close is around 15, and revenue has been increasing low-single digits in recent years. 

Things I like about them include:

- I lived in OR for several years and was both a residential and business customer of theirs. I know their CS is top notch / mailed statements professional /emergency response *fast* (less than 30 mins on a Friday)
- They should be pretty COVID proof, and they have a regulated monopoly. Folks need heat and theyâ€™ve been supplying since the late 1800â€™s.
- They advertise in their annual reports that they have one of the best maintained systems in the country.

Things I donâ€™t like about them include:
- Being a mature utility, Iâ€™m told these trade like bonds at times, and a shift in interest rates can shift their price up (on interest decrease) or down (on interest increase). 
- The NW seems to be having more weather related issues than say the midwest or northeast. For instance, wildfires in OR have been bad in recent years. I actually evacuated my house in 2020 because of them. Thereâ€™s also been droughts making wildfires more likely. Buying into NWN exposes you somewhat to these regional issues, and if it gets bad enough people move thats less customers. 
- The stock likely will never be the next apple, and Iâ€™m young/looking to grow wealth quickly and safely.

rc2mhe,ORCoast19,"VCSA went public this week

Hey Everyone, 
Vacasa, a vacation rental property management company, went public this week. If anyone is interested in them I wanted to share some of my industry experience on them and VRs in general. I competed with them in OR for 6 years and have met dozens of their owners and employees. 

On valuation, after-hours they were trading at a 4.13 billion market cap for ~30,000 properties. This equates to $137,700 per managed unit. Competing with them and other companies in Oregon, most small companies would sell for between $10,000 and $15,000 per unit. The company I worked for was a bottom dweller, and got some units below $7,500 at times. Theyâ€™re expecting 1.25 billion in revenue for 2021 with part of the year having Turnkeyâ€™s acquisition baked in. This means revenue per house is somewhere north of around $41,666 per house before they split out their fees, which isnâ€™t that bad. 

As this type of business scales the margin gets better and better. Managing 200+ units I had net profit margins before taxes around 10% for every dollar of revenue taken in to be split between owner and PM. At vacasaâ€™s scale I could see them getting this north of 20%. If they were just milking the business for cash/avoiding huge IPO-related management bonuses this would put their net profit EBITA at around ~250 million with the 2021 revenue numbers. Doesnâ€™t sound that bad, right?

The downside is theyâ€™ve made a bad name for themselves, and I think organic growth will be hard to come by. Hearing from old employees, management was pretty oblivious to field conditions and field staff member complaints. In a business like this, field staff is ~80% of your employees so imagine ignoring 4/5 of your employees. I recruited HKâ€™s from them all the time due to payroll issues, overwork, and scheduling favoritism. On the owner front, a guy with a townhome in Newport, OR actually reported they left a leak unchecked that caved in his third floor ceiling. Iâ€™ve signed owners further up the coast that found meth and needles *after* their cleaning team had gone in and completed a post stay clean. Operational issues seem to continue to grow but they keep scaling. 

From a revenue perspective, much of their growth stemmed from underpricing the competition dramatically when they started up. This worked for ~5 years where they were able to produce better owner returns due to price undercutting, but competition responded. Now, most owners will produce the same or less compared to homes managed by local competitors. A homeowner I signed from them, one of the first 200, summed it up by saying thereâ€™s too many homes pulling from the same traffic. They havenâ€™t scaled customers as theyâ€™ve scaled, diluting homeowner results. 

In summary, I think the operational issues will limit organic growth, and their profit potential wonâ€™t be realized because management isnâ€™t hungry. Why would you be, being the biggest vacation rental pm in the US? 

Iâ€™ll be a buyer around $2/share, or higher if they step back from their growth plans and focus on their ground game.

Edit: Realized google was showing a bad valuation and edited for the higher. Each managed vacasa unit is essentially 137k+ to buy, crazy high.",,,,,

For me right now Iâ€™m big OXY and OXY/WS for 2022 with 300 and 429 shares respectively, about 16.5k. This is ~18% of my portfolio. Iâ€™m a fan of the company because theyâ€™re paying down billions in debt each year, and having worked for a highly leveraged company in the past I know how fabulous that can make earnings going forward. Each quarter they get 10â€™s of millions more profit for future quarters due to less debt repayment. They also have over 10 billion in FCF this year if oil stays at its current heights and lots of tangible assets if inflation gets out of control. Lastly, I like that the dividend is small - when it increases in the future itâ€™ll be a stock price catalyst, and itâ€™ll help keep my taxes lower in the meantime.",,,,,
tiauc1,ORCoast19,"Why is Stellantis (STLA) so cheap?

Iâ€™ve been looking for cheap stock and found Stellantis recently that I think fits the mold. Pros are:

- Discounted compared to peers with a P/E of ~3.25, market cap of 45.7 billion with 1/3 of that being their net cash position, and cash flows of 18 billion annually. 
- Transitioning to EVs and realizing great synergies from a recent merger. 

Cons are:
- Paying a heavy dividend of over 7%. Iâ€™d rather see them reinvest or buy back shares. 
- Based in Europe. Adds complexity to taxes. The company handles revenue in Euros and is more exposed to the russian-ukraine situation than non-european manufacturers.

- They have several competitors, and no one Iâ€™ve seen swears by the product. Seems like appliance purchasers donâ€™t have much brand loyalty so consumer sensitivity to price is probably high.

Donâ€™t yall find it interesting that Berkshire bought 25 billion in energy stocks this quarter? Mostly CVX but some OXY too. Not only that but Clayton Homes, a subsidiary of berkshireâ€™s at the annual meeting, unveiled a net-zero energy home. I walked the net-zero home at the exhibit and it was pretty nice. They had a trash can outfront showing the minimal waste. But at ~242k+ including the solar panels the 3 bed, 2 bath was a big shift from the last home I saw showcased by the company. In 2017 they had one that was ~75k+, a 2 bedroom 2 bath. Its almost like the company believes energy is going to be expensive in the foreseeable future.

I have 2100 shares of OXY and 500 shares of SHEL feeling the same way. The space has chronic underinvestment, and large projects started now will take 5-10 years to get online. The russia-ukraine war just added fuel to the fire, and if the EU does an embargo on russia that can create some long-lasting damage to their oil productivity that may never fully recover. 

Then you have environmentalists calling for no new projects whatsoever, and disrupting the flow of supplies. Thats fine if thats what the general population wants to do but at the same time thereâ€™s scientists warning of potential catastrophic sea level rise within 10 years if major chunks of antartica go. Think of all the energy itâ€™d take if hundreds of millions get displaced, and shelters as well as infrastructure need to be built to accomodate them in addition to the energy used in the mass migrations. 

You also have huge food shortages on the horizon, which has historically destablized 3rd world countries, reducing oil production from any of the countries engaged in it. Itâ€™ll be a second â€˜arab springâ€™ but worse since the food shortage is projected to surpass the prior event.

I felt pretty confident at that time because I have about a decade of industry experience, which included competing with them in three different markets (OR, NC and now AZ). 

$VCSA is a shitshow at times- Iâ€™ve personally sold PM services to owners whoâ€™ve reported meth being left from guests after cleaners have gone through and a whole 3rd floor collapsing due to an unaddressed leak to give a few stories. But hereâ€™s the thing, the vacation rental business is very complex. Even at small managers you have issues. We had a housekeeper go crazy in a 180-unit PM and put holes throughout drywall in a house sheâ€™d locked herself inside. The business will always have â€˜chaosâ€™ to some extent because guests are unpredictable, staff can be unpredictable, and shit happens. 

So that all being said, Iâ€™ve started buying $VCSA at these levels, knowing all the good and bad that comes with it. With its current market cap and units under management the price per contract is under $20,000 at this point which is cheap. For comparison, my first employer sold their business a year ago for north of $35,000 per unit to private equity. They had a 220 unit portfolio vs $VCSAâ€™s soon to be 42,000 unit portfolio.

Benefits of the state plan are that earnings are tax free when used for education, and Iâ€™d get ~6.25% of my money back instantly via state income tax savings.  Cons are that they charge 1%+ for the funds management fees, and investment options are very limited. Over the last 5 years Iâ€™ve had an average return of 26.5% vs the market return of 10.98%. I believe Iâ€™d need to average around a 16% return in a brokerage account to be â€˜better offâ€™ than the 529 plan with its tax advantages and average historic returns of 7.5%. 

What would you do in this situation? I donâ€™t have 20+ years of investing history so the 26.5% return isnâ€™t that great of a gauge (Iâ€™ve averaged it for at least 7 years), but feel like I might do better even with the tax disadvantages going it the brokerage route.

zttpsr,ORCoast19,"Time-Weighted vs Money-Weighted Returns

Hello, 
Iâ€™m a bit confused on my IRA returns. Since 2015 my time-weighted return is -59.71%, and my money-weighted return is 341.71%. Iâ€™m trying to figure which one is more indicative of performance but canâ€™t get my head around why they differ so dramatically. I took some money out to buy my first home so I think that might be some of the difference but does anyone know just looking at these numbers if Iâ€™m doing better than indexing?

ek077s,OutdoorJimmyRustler,"Help Understanding Arbitrage Concept and Theoretical Scenario

I figured some of the bond traders on here might be able to gauge my rationale behind these assumptions.

Many cities across the United States are issuing Pension Obligation Bonds (""POB's"") to pay down pension debt.  In most cases, cities are members of a State-administered investment pool.  Cities are required to pay into the investment pool based on a formula that is multiplied by the quantity of employees that they have in the system.  The pension recipients have promised benefit amounts (defined benefit).  If the State-administered fund fails to make a return that is high enough to cover the increasing costs of benefits, the State basically charges cities to make up the delta.  This is becoming increasingly common.  Usually, cities do not have the money up front to pay this delta, so it sits on their books as an Unfunded Accrued Liability or ""UAL."" 

In California, the State-administered pension system charges municipalities that have a UAL *interest* on the UAL principal based on the State-administered pensions system's estimated investment return.  If the State thinks they can make a 7% market return, they charge municipalities a 7% interest penalty on their UAL principal.  The State does this because if the municipality had actually paid the UAL up front, the State would have taken that UAL principal and made an additional 7% on it.

In response, cities in California have been issuing POB's that have a fixed interest rate of 3-4%.  They pay the UAL principal down, avoid having a 7% interest rate (in place of the lower 3-4% interest rate), and save money in the long run.  

1. Is this what *arbitrage* is?  Taking out a loan for 3%, thus *""*making"" 4%?  

2. The 7% charge from the State pension system in California fluctuates.  There's talk of the State lowering that return projection, which could mitigate the savings made by cities that issue POB's at 3-4% interest.  As such, opponents of this strategy have attacked the rationale behind POB's.  In theory, the State pension system could make a negative return.  When that happens, cities get charged to make up the difference between the assets of the funds and the liability of payments owed to pensioners.  In theory, a city could take out a 3% POB, pay their UAL, and receive a negative return on a huge principal in the short run if the market crashes.    My response to this has been that since we have to pay the UAL anyways, it makes no difference if we pay it now or later.  No one can time the market (certainly, municipalities can't), so it makes do difference if we pay the UAL when the market is growing or contracting.  Thoughts on this?",,,,,

I'm trying to work through what I owe (if I do) in federal  taxes (and specifically long-term capital gains or ltcg) for '22 and trying to determine whether I owe estimated tax.  Background details:

1. Single Filer, in my 40s  and assume no previous liability from prior tax years
2. I had income from a part-time, temporary job for a portion of the year:  $7500
3. My W2 shows I paid $235 in federal taxes for aforementioned income (also paid approp state tax)
4. I took distributions from my IRA to assist with  my  Advanced Degree study (early contribution exempted from penalty bc its used for tuition): $21,094
5. From the IRA distributions above, I withheld $3000 for Federal Taxes; in addition I also withheld for state taxes at my state's local flat tax rate.  (Looks like I overpaid on Fed Tax)
6. I cashed out on long-term stock (&gt; 1yr)  I owned through a taxable investment account at various points throughout the year.  Total Gains from stock sales: $30,000. 
7. Assume no short-term gains (ie $0)

&amp;#x200B;

Here's my understanding of the total tax I owe on Ordinary Income (OI):

1. Combine W2 and IRA Contributions:  $37500
2. I'm taking the  standard deduction for this example which I believe is  $12,950 for '22.
3. Determine Taxable Income:  $37500 - $12,950 = $24,550
4. That would imply that my fed taxes due on OI would be: (10% \* $10,275) + (.12 \* $14,275)  = $2740.5

LTCG Taxes:

Based on  [this](https://www.fiphysician.com/capital-gains-stack-on-top-of-ordinary-income/) explanation, my understanding is I wouldn't owe taxes on my LTCG  because the total gains are less than $41,675   (the page is old and the tax rates are outdated but I'm trying to follow the formula).

Some portion of the portfolio is used to execute short-term trades based on crypto volatility.  In doing so, you accrue gains from buying/selling.

Voyager announces that they've suspended trading and have restricted your access to assets.  You are not able to do anything with crypto or money for the remainder of the taxable year as Voyager restructures.  They were (are) able to do this because their terms of service stipulate that you are pledging any assets you transfer to their platform.

Iâ€™ve held this CRC position since August of this year and things have not been well. The expectations of what theyâ€™re expecting is way above my pay grade (medical stuff I canâ€™t do), and Iâ€™ve expressed this concern since November and nothing has changed.

Weâ€™re brutally understaffed and Iâ€™ve fallen so far behind there is zero chance of me catching up unless I come in at 730AM and stay until 6pm. 

The â€œrehireâ€ policy is if I get fired I canâ€™t get another job with this company. The BEST jobs that pay the most are with my employer here in my city of Richmond. 

I decided to quit with two very good leads: one is for the SAME position as a contractor for $65k at a building less than 100 ft away. 

The other is for a Clinical Research Coordinator for a startup CRO company in DC that pays $70k.

I plan on doing tons of interview prep, still look for other hospital jobs in the area, but this is where things are going and Iâ€™m confident I made the right choice.

10v7zqx,paulrudder,"Does anyone recommend reducing/pausing 401k contributions while getting out of consumer debt?

I'm paying off some consumer debt - car loan (almost there), credit cards (hopefully by end of year), student loans (this will take a while and is less of an immediate priority but still on my agenda).

My company offers a 6% 401k match that I take advantage of. I was previously contributing 3% to an employee stock discount program also, but just paused that. Painful to do with the current downtrend in the market as I feel like I'm getting a fire sale but every little bit helps. With taxes, medical, 401k and employee stock, almost 50% of my pay was being removed from every paycheck and that's a tough pill to swallow.

 Besides pausing the employee stock contribution for the time being, I was thinking of temporarily reducing or even altogether pausing the 401k match. This is what Dave Ramsey recommends but i just can't bring myself to do a full pause - feels like I'm throwing away ""free"" money for my future. That being said, if I did it for a few months it would help me more aggressively tackle the credit card and car loan.

What do you guys think? Does it ever make sense to pause contributions to speed up debt payoff? Should I maybe roll back from 6% to even just 4% or something for a short period so I'm still getting a partial match?",,,,,
11n2zr2,paulrudder,"Can someone help me with a tax question?

So I'm using TurboTax, and in 2022, I received $1 in a crypto token via Robinhood's ""Learn and Earn"" program.

When I imported my data directly from Robinhood into TurboTax, it auto-populated this $1 under the Wages and Income - Form 1099-MISC section.

However, when I get to the last step to review my return before filing, it keeps flagging this form and saying I have it reported as miscellaneous income but it isn't reflected elsewhere on my tax return (or something to that effect). i guess I am super confused why I would *need* to also claim it elsewhere on my tax return if it's already being accounted for under the 1099-MISC section.

Does anyone happen to know what it means / what it's looking for, or whether I need to claim this twice on my return for some reason?

There's a whole separate section in TurboTax to manually enter miscellaneous income, which I did for unreported crypto staking rewards i received from other crypto exchanges that didn't generate tax docs. Maybe it's flagging it because I don't have it reported in that section? But that doesn't make sense to me since it got auto imported via Robinhood.",,,,,
11ns6yl,paulrudder,"Tax question I can't seem to find the answer to: Can I delete $0 sales from my 1099-B?

I tried posting this on r/tax and didn't get any replies, so I thought maybe someone here might know.

I'm using TurboTax and imported all my crypto transactions from 2022 via CoinTracker, which auto generated a 1099-B listing every single transaction.

I guess because I earned weekly ""Staking"" rewards (similar to interest or dividends) through exchanges like Coinbase, I have small transactions for fractions of tokens being received for $0. Just as a hypothetical, let's say I bought 999.95 XLM tokens (a pretty cheap coin) and staked them... each week I might have received 0.005 XLM's as a ""reward,"" but each of those distributions have a $0 value because they're practically worthless.

When I sold/disposed of some of these holdings later on, CoinTracker automatically accounted for every single lot I ever received of each coin, even though many of these micro transactions of received interest/staking were virtually worthless.

So for example let's say I sold 1,000 XLM, and 999.95 of those were what i originally purchased, and the other .05 were the total of all my staking rewards for the year... It's showing on my 1099-B a ""sell"" transaction for *every single staking lot I received,* and every single one of them has a $0 value. 

Because CoinTracker is reporting and tracking every single one of these $0 staking rewards, they are showing up on my form 1099-B, so I have a bunch of $0 sales listed. TurboTax is flagging these as an error and asking me to adjust the cost basis, but I can't, because they are essentially worthless. I guess TurboTax is confused because normally if you're selling something it has a value, but in this case each lot is so small and miniscule that there's literally no dollar value attached.

All this being said, I'm assuming I should just go ahead and delete anything that is $0, correct? I don't need to document sales of small lots with a worth of $0? Even if all those lots combined added up to a few cents, it's not like I'm going to get in trouble for not claiming them, correct? I'm assuming as long as I have anything of actual dollar value accounted for then I should be fine?",,,,,
12jop68,paulrudder,"Removing PPI from my mortgage -- is it worth doing now, or should I just let it fall off automatically?

I purchased my home for $144k in 2019 and I've paid down the principal to $135k. A decent amount of my monthly mortgage payment goes towards PPI which I'd love to have removed. I'm in PA and my understanding is that it automatically falls off after you reach 20% equity in your home? Which in my case I think would mean paying it down by about $30k.

But the estimated value has risen exponentially over the past 4 years and it says it's worth at least $200k now and I know homes have sold for around $220k on my street.

So my questions are:

* if I just make additional payments on the principal will it automatically fall off once I pay it down by that \~20% number?
* is it worth paying for someone to come out and do an evaluation of the property, and if they estimate it's worth more and I already have 20% equity in the home, would I be able to send that info to my mortgage lender and they'd basically just remove the PMI?

I feel like I know the answer to this already but just need people to tell me â€œyes.â€

I made some stock investments in 2020-2021 when my income was a bit higher and my debt was lower. My credit cards have increased substantially the past year and although my income will be higher the remainder of this year, I just hate carrying the higher balance.

I could cash out some of my stocks right now for minor losses, and immediately pay off one of the card balances, but I keep thinking â€œwhat if the market rallies and the stock 5xâ€™s?â€ - which I know is not really the right mentality to have and feels more like gambling.

17my242,paulrudder,"Should I cash out stocks to pay down credit card debt?

It's embarrassing to admit but I have about $25k in credit card debt at the moment.  Fortunately half of that is on a 0%apr transfer card, and the rest is on a relatively low interest card (13.99%).

I was making more money in 2020-2022 and just got hit with a lot of setbacks this year, including medical expenses blah blah... end of the day it doesn't really matter, but I started relying on my card more thinking I'd be able to pay it down with each month's commission check, but then there was always something random and unexpected that would set me back further, like an $1800 vet bill. 

All that being said my income is decent at about $100k/yr... but after taxes, medical deductions, 401k, etc. I have only netted about $55k this year. So at first glance it sounds like I should be able to pay off this debt ASAP with my income level, but the reality is I'd have to pause my 401k contributions to really increase my take home pay and there's not much I can do about high taxes and medical insurance deductions.

I have about $5k in company stock and $1500 is currently eligible to cash out. I'd hate to do it with the market the way it is right now but I realize it could also downturn further next year if we do enter a proper recession. I guess I was looking for some advice on what I should do.

I would hate to pause my 401k but do you guys think in the short term it would make sense for a few months?

i really don't have that much in the way of frivolous expenses, but it's just me with a dog and a cat to care for, a mortgage to pay, a car loan (almost paid off) and now $350/mo in student loan payments starting back up so it starts to feel spread very thin. My biggest out of pocket expense each month is absolutely on groceries. I rarely eat out, never Doordash, etc. -- that's why it sucks to have so much credit card debt...

17wpsg4,paulrudder,"Looking for financial advice on which of these medical plans I should choose for next year

Which of these medical plans would you guys pick in my shoes? Iâ€™m looking for objective advice from a financial perspective.

I have to choose between a Pay Later or Pay Now medical PPO plan for next year through my employer.

Pay Later is $49 biweekly and has an $800 deductible and $4000 out of pocket max in network, $7500 out of network max, and copays for doctor visits are $5 more.

Pay Now is $67 biweekly but features a $500 deductible, a $1500 out of pocket max in network, $4000 out of network max and doctor copays are $5 less.

Iâ€™m generally healthy in my 30s but had a scare with a cyst on my kidney last year. The first MRI results were reassuring but my urologist does want me to go back and get a second MRI in spring 2024â€¦ so Iâ€™m going into next year knowing Iâ€™ll have to pay for the MRI. I do not know whether that would be enough of an incentive to pay for the Pay Now plan so I have a lower deductible and out of pocket max depending on the MRI costs.

Besides that I donâ€™t really foresee too many medical expenses. I was thinking of trying to find a naturopathic doctor but they donâ€™t usually take insurance anyway. But maybe that would go to my out of pocket max? Not sure how that works.

Any recommendations or insights would be much appreciated.",,,,,

esjyie,paulrudder,"Is my homeowners' insurance going to go up because of this?

I made another topic earlier in r/HomeImprovement and got some good feedback. TL;DR version -- someone threw a rock through my double pane window last night and it shattered the outer pane. Didn't notice until this morning, called the police and the guy who came out told me to check with my insurance company and see if there's a deductible for vandalism since I'm basically S.O.L. in terms of them catching whoever did it.

I didn't realize I have an insurance *agent* that I'm supposed to contact first (only been a homeowner for a year), so I called the insurance company directly and explained what happened to the rep. He told me he would have to pass it along to their claims department and have someone give me a call. I reiterated that I wasn't interested in filing a claim at this point but just wanted to know what my deductible would be... and he said he couldn't tell me until they looked it over. I feel like he pulled one over on me because I later found out that by passing it to their claims department it was processed as a claim.

Someone in the original topic about the window damage told me that this could go on my account history, and that I should have called my agent first for advice. So I found my agent's info and called them and they told me to call the insurance company back and cancel the claim. Called them back and it had already been assigned to some guy in the claims department. Got his voicemail. An hour later he emails me back and says he canceled the claim for me. I replied and asked to clarify whether this would go on my account history and he said he couldn't tell me that, and that for rate-related questions I needed to ask my agent.

Called my agent back, and she told me I'll probably be OK since it was canceled so quickly and that she wouldn't worry about it, but that she won't be able to tell for a few months and that the best time to check is when my policy is due for renewal and we can address it then.

SOOOO basically today has been a nightmare from beginning to end and now I'm worried that my premium is going to go up next year even though I very clearly stated from the onset that I didn't want to file a claim. I guess I should have known about how agents work, but quite honestly I've never had to go through anything like this before, not even with my vehicle (knock on wood). I was wondering if anyone here has an opinion on whether this could impact my score/premium and, if so, how much?

ew43er,paulrudder,"I get paid commission (sales) and had 30% taken out for taxes; is this standard?

Sorry if this is a stupid question. I will delete it if I'm an idiot for asking haha. But it's hard to use tax calculators I found online because they are usually based on salary or hourly, and my income is largely commission.

I was really stoked to get a big pay check tomorrow because I made the most commission of any month and achieved my annual budget, so also got an additional bonus on top of that. And because there were three pay checks this month all my medical was already taken out of the last one so I thought less would be withheld. Long story short my gross pay was $6800 and I just got my pay stub for tomorrow's direct deposit... And it's $4600. Still a lot and I'm grateful regardless but I just thought it was a bit less than I had expected. But I'm also fairly naive when it comes to how taxes work and that's why I thought I'd ask here.

When I look at my net vs gross pay for the year so far it says 31% has been withheld for taxes so maybe that is right in line with where it should be?

ewqdao,paulrudder,"Is it possible to deduct the expense for LinkedIn Sales Navigator when I file taxes? (I work in sales.)

I work for a major telecom company, and my role is in outside sales. Despite trying numerous times to make a case for LinkedIn Sales Navigator (which is a prospecting tool that is *awesome* for finding leads and bypassing gatekeepers, but also happens to cost $60/mo annually and $80/mo without contract), my company won't allow me to expense the cost -- most likely because if they allowed me to, then every sales rep would want to across the nation. They also have licensing agreements with specific software/websites (like AdMall) so I would imagine it might be against some kind of pact they have with them, but that's just speculation.

Anyway, I really, really love the tool and actually made a sale with it in the past for $6k/year, so I know it works. But I hate the idea of paying that much money out of pocket each month. Yeah, it could very well offset its cost if I bring in even just a couple big purchasers -- but it's still a little tough to swallow a $720 price tag.

So my question is -- I know in the past when I use TurboTax it will ask if I have work expenses and receipts. I usually don't put anything in, since my company will reimburse me for small things (e.g. if I needed to buy a charger for my work phone, or something like that). But would I be able to itemize/deduct a substantial cost item like the membership to LinkedIn Sales Nav? 

I did Google the question but didn't really find very definitive answers. I asked LinkedIn directly and they directed me towards one of the somewhat vague articles about it. So... thought I'd ask here in the hopes of getting your input! Thanks in advance!",,,,,
f6erqf,paulrudder,"Having trouble figuring out W4 allowances - my employer doesn't have a worksheet for it.

I'm in debt, trying to pay it down as aggressively as possible. I listen to Dave Ramsey and he always tells callers not to have any extra tax withheld from their pay checks because it's basically giving the government a free loan all year.

I went into my employer's HR web portal and clicked on my tax withholding, and it just has a box to enter ""number of exemptions."" Initially I believe I had 0 exemptions for both state and federal. Right now I have 2 for federal (changed it in December based on the advice of a coworker) and 0 for my state (which is PA).  However I don't know if 2 is too many, too little, etc. -- I don't want to owe money but I also don't extra withheld. I was afraid to touch the state exemptions because I wasn't sure if it worked differently than federal.

I've Googled how many to claim, and the pages always say to fill out the employer's tax withholding worksheet. The problem is my employer doesn't have one. It's literally just a page that lets me change the numbers without any explanation of what they do or point of reference.

That being said, can you guys advise on what you would do in my shoes?  If it matters at all, I'm 31, single, no dependents. I am salaried at $45k but have a sales job, with an additional \~$25-$30k due in commission, which I believe is paid out as 'bonus' income (and based on what I've read on this forum before, bonus money is taxed at the full 30% regardless of how many exemptions one chooses?

First of all, let me say how great it is that this subreddit exists because I've had a couple tax related questions pop up recently and you guys have been able to point me in the right direction. I'm really grateful for that!

I work full time and received a form 1095-C last week. From my understanding it's proof that I had employee provided health care. Turbo tax has an input section for the form... But none of their input boxes match up with what's on my form. For example, it says line 1 should provide the employer's info, but on my actual form, line 1 is just *my* name and address. I'm also confused why the form shows about $95 in total coverage because my biweekly pay check takes out WAY more than $95.

f9yod1,paulrudder,"Turbo Tax won't let me submit my federal tax return because of a 1098 form -- and I'm at a loss as to what to do!

I closed on my first home purchase the last week of Dec, 2018 (I believe on the 28th). Sometime in early 2019, my original loan provider sold off the loan to a company called Freedom Mortgage, so since then I've been remitting my payments to them.

I received two 1098 (mortgage interest) forms for 2019: one from the original loan provider, and one from Freedom Mortgage.

I paid $599 in interest to the original loan provider, but the form they sent me has blank fields for everything else -- e.g. where it says ""outstanding mortgage principal,"" it is blank. Points paid is blank (even though, from looking at the copy of my closing disclosure from Dec 2018, it shows that I paid 77 points at closing, so I'm assuming I should list the 77 points since I never claimed them for my 2019 tax returns?).

The other form I received from Freedom Mortgage has full details for everything and all the boxes are filled in... but Turbo Tax will NOT let me submit my federal taxes until I fill in the ""outstanding mortgage principal"" for the original loan. It tells me to ""check my January 2019 mortgage statement"" if it's not included on the 1098 form -- but I do not have the mortgage statement from January, and since I no longer deal with the same mortgage company, I don't have online access to pull the statement, either.

fceo91,paulrudder,"Should I re-finance my mortgage for a lower interest rate?

I bought my first home in Jan 2019 and was locked in @ 5.125% with an FHA loan, 30 years fixed. The original loan amount was for $140,400 and my current balance is $138,189, so I've paid it down only a couple thousand dollars. My taxes and insurance are escrowed in.

I was contacted with an offer to refinance @ 3.625% FHA, same loan terms (30 years fixed)... but due to closing costs and all that fun stuff, it would actually raise my balance to $143,420.

Now, I do plan to stay in this house long-term so I know it probably makes sense to refinance... but it's hard for me to stomach seeing the mortgage balance increase to above where it was even initially, and quite honestly I'm not sure if the lower interest rate is appealing enough to make it worthwhile yet.

For the past year I've been actively paying against my credit card debt. I'm embarrassed to say I had it up to $30k at one point (long story - combo of immaturity, lack of budgeting skills and quite honestly a depressive period where I felt defeated) but I've wisened up, learned a lot, and am on a written budget now. I've brought it down to $18.5k at this point with no frivolous spending, but it's been tough and I have had the Murphys Law setbacks, e.g. I switched to a cheaper car insurance policy but didn't realize it had to be paid in full for the entire year in cash, so suddenly my $80/mo insurance budget was an $850 bill. ðŸ˜‚ Then I had someone throw a rock through my living room window and had to shell out $350 for repairs... But that's life right? 

Anyway, the ""0% APR balance transfer"" cards I had transferred my two highest balances to will be ending in a few months. (they are typically 18 months.) once the promo ends the APR is ridiculously high, ranging from 24â€”30%.

I was considering opening more promotional zero APR balance transfer lines of credit, but I'm wondering if it makes more sense to consolidate the remaining balances onto a personal loan/debt consolidation service.

My credit score is around 760 iirc (I just had it pulled while refinancing my home for a lower rate and I was surprised how much it had gone up) if that helps at all, I wasn't sure if a debt consolidation service would be ideal in this case or if I would qualify for a lower rate loan through something like a federal credit union?

ibo9ea,paulrudder,"Anyone have experience with Discover personal loans? (for debt consolidation)

I have been trying to snowball my debt and have whittled down my credit cards from $30k to $16k in about a year and a half (I know, it's embarrassing, but I was very dumb and naive and maybe a little self destructive after college and got in so deep I stopped caring for a while - it's been a humbling path to pay it all down, haha).

Anyway, my remaining balance is spread across three cards, one of which is a promotional zero balance APR but it's set to expire in November and my other two already expired. I believe the interest rates are 10.99 and 20.99.

I was going to open another zero balance card and transfer them but they typically hit you with fees for doing so. Instead, I was thinking of getting a personal loan to pay off the majority of the remaining balance.

Discover offered me a 60mos loan for $15k @ 10.99 apr and I was considering taking it. I know on paper it's moving one debt to another form of debt but I do think mentally it will help having everything consolidated.

nyku3s,paulrudder,"Are capital gains on stocks offset by losses?

Probably a dumb question.

I understand you have to pay roughly 30 percent tax on stocks sold under a certain time period (I think a year and a half?).

I might go to a tax accountant next year for peace of mind, but I'd also like to know now so that I can make sure I'm recording transactions properly. I also worry that accountants in my conservative town may not have a clue about this topic lol. 

It's my understanding that when you ""swap"" one token for another it's a taxable event since it's technically a sale of one asset for another.

My situation is this: I usually just buy and hold with Fiat dollars on Coinbase, but I decided to buy a promising up and coming token that is not yet available on Coinbase and cannot be purchased with US dollars. Basically the only way to buy is to ""swap"" bitcoin or USDT (a stable coin tied to the US dollar) for this new crypto coin. 

So, I withdrew about 60 XLM coins (roughly $23 usd) from my wallet and sent it to another app called Kucoin. I then sold the 60 XLM for ~$23 USDT (again, this being a stable coin but not actually USD) and *then* used that USDT balance to purchase this new coin. 

Now, I guess my question is this: when I sold my 60 XLM coins for USDT, there's probably a cost basis involved... But since this is taking place on a different app from Coinbase, how do I ""consolidate"" or calculate those numbers? In other words if I was buying XLM repeatedly over the past year and then I ""sell"" 60 of them (even though I'm technically just swapping them for another coin to turn around and buy another), how do I calculate my cost basis for tax purposes?

Let's say I bought some XLM at X value last year, some more at Y value this year, and now I just sold *some* of my total balance at Z value... Would x be my cost basis?

lm5saq,PeeB4uGoToBed,"Very high credit score but also bad debt to income ratio, what are my options to do anything to save money?

So I'm STILL working reduced hours since last March, I pulled my 401k to pay off a personal loan and pay off debts that I couldn't continue to pay off of reduced income and now I want/need to save even more. I only have a few hundred dollars left to pay off on a credit card and that will be done with. I just checked my credit scores and they're all just over 800

As far as debt that can be refinanced I have a home loan and a car loan

Car is 4.75% with $4,184.10 left on it and $252.20 monthly payment

House is $90,570.17 at 4.5% with $655.10 monthly payment

All my life I've had a checking account and worked paycheck to paycheck so those savings accounts with .0002% interest never really enticed me because I needed the money and couldn't save anyway.

I finally paid off my car and I want to throw that $250 a month into a savings but I want to be able to use it in case I have to because I had a third emergency this year and my emergency fund is wiped clean and in the negative so even saving this 250 a month will be hard but I'm gonna try.

Now, I don't exactly make a lot of money but I seem to have pretty expensive hobbies. I'm on the fence of trading one hobby for another or just saving up over the course of a year or two to be able to fund my next.

I got into collecting records and I can roughly sell my collection for $10k-$15k which would be plenty to buy one expensive pinball machine or a couple cheaper ones.

I've been paying $200 a month instead of the minimum $145.53 because I'm not about to pay off this loan over 10 years lol. I'm not sure if the extra $54.47 is going to interest or the principal.

I'm reading this:

&gt; Catch-Up Contributions Increased; Must be Made on a Post-Tax (""Roth"") Basis. In 2023, participants age 50 and older can contribute an extra $7,500 per year annually into their 401(k) account. This amount will increase to $10,000 per year (indexed for inflation) starting in 2025 for participants age 60 to 63. Also, after 2023, all catch-up contributions for participants earning over $145,000 annually must be made on a Roth (after-tax) basis.

10h5pnb,pigskins65,"[USA] Where to park funds for a high-deductible health plan? I am almost certainly going to hit the max OOP.

The bad news -- right after open enrollment completed an issue was discovered that required me to have a very expensive procedure. I met my deductible and max OOP for 2022 and will more than likely meet them again this year. I was thinking I should/could take the max OOP amount ($6000) and park it somewhere. The good news is that I didn't need to touch HSA funds last year and am still able to sock away the max HSA contribution for 2023 and not have it impact our financial situation. Using those funds now would feel like a buy-high-sell-low situation.

I've spent most of my life making Trad contributions to my 401k and getting employer contributions.  I feel like I messed up.

I feel like I should've done Roth contributions in the early days.

Now I'm in my early 40s with \~$143k gross annual salary (before bonuses or RSUs) and I think most would say that I missed the bus and that at this income level I should continue doing Trad contributions.  Agree or disagree?

Personally, I feel like I rather pay higher tax per paycheck now to reduce tax burdens in retirement and go full Roth contributions to my 401k from here on out.  We also don't know what tax laws will be like in the future.  What do you guys think?  Oh yeah, my plan also allows in-plan Roth conversions using after-tax dollars too, if it makes a difference.

Hi all, I currently have a HYSA with Discover and another one with Ally.  Both have the same yield of 3.3% at the moment and I use them for different reasons/purposes.

I also use Fidelity for my 401k, IRA, and taxable brokerage.

Recently I read that the SPAXX (Fidelity Government Money Market) offers higher yield than the HYSAs out there.  If this is true, why would anyone need a HYSA?  Should I move all my cash to the SPAXX?
