lfy99e,Avionics_Engineer06,"High Cost of Living Mortgage Early Mortgage Payoff

For those of you who live in high cost-of-living areas, how do you square away ever getting out from under your mortgages?

I own a home in the Seattle metro area with a mortgage of 700K 30 years at 2.25%. I have a wife and four children. I make a decent income 145K. You see all the people from low cost of living areas making this kind of money with very small mortgages. What is the point of chasing a higher salary in these HCOL areas if you can never afford to pay off your home?

I save 15% between my 401k and Roth IRA for retirement but I just feel like I am never going to get out from underneath such a large mortgage. I also see little value of paying it down early since the interest rate is so low, I would rather put the money towards retirement/savings. Between the mortgage/taxes/insurance the payment is about $3450 a month. I feel defeated that I will never get it paid off while being able to meet my other financial goals such as saving for retirement.

Any words of wisdom or encouragement for those living with large mortgages in HCOL areas. I am confident I am saving enough for retirement however, it definitely feels tight with the mortgage.  I will tell you there were only about 10 homes on the market when we were looking. Multiple bids/offer situations. We were able to get a new build with no bidding since we were willing to wait for its completion.

We have no debt and a 6-month emergency fund but still feeling the squeeze...

li4d1o,Avionics_Engineer06,"Should I Convert a Traditional to Roth IRA?

Hello community

I am 33 years old, make 145K a year and had an old 401K/ Roth 401K that I rolled into respective IRAs. I was thinking of converting some of the traditional IRA to Roth we are talking about 71K in the traditional IRA.

With my income I would be paying a hefty 23% tax on the conversion. I am not sure what my tax bracket will look like going into retirement is it worth converting as much as you can to Roth or just leave it to have tax diversification?

Is it worth converting to Roth with a 6 figure income?

I could also roll over for instance 10k a year to spread out the pain....

In my new company I invest 8% of my pay in Roth 401K the company puts 9% in pre-tax. I also contribute 7% to my Roth IRA any my wifeâ€™s Roth IRA.

What would be the most likely strategy to pay as little to the tax man as possible with the conditions above?

What are the community's thoughts on daily transactions into Roth IRA/Brokerage accounts?

For example, I am putting in $200 a week into a Roth IRA (Until Maxed) and $200 into a Brokerage account. If I put in $40 every weekday (auto invested in my choice of mutual funds), would anyone see this as beneficial being that you could pay the actual closing price at each day that way you are paying on the way down and paying on the way up to get a better average of the market price?

lkw0mv,Avionics_Engineer06,"Roth IRA Tax Implications with Kids

Hello, community.

I typically see some in the financial world talking down contributing to Roth 401K/Roth IRA when you are in the 22% or 23% tax bracket, because many times you may have less tax liability in retirement than your high earning years.

But one thing I never hear about is tax credits you get that can significantly reduce your tax rate. For example. I have 4 children that are currently 8K of tax credits. If the Stimulus bill passes and the child credit goes up to $3,000 that would be 12k in child tax credits. 

I did the calculations for this year with how things stand I am only paying a 6-7% effective tax rate. Using this logic wouldn't it make more sense for most everyone with kids to max out Roth as long as they can before they hit the income limits or their children grow up and leave? 

Sorry, I don't see many people referencing effective tax rates in reference to Roth only the tax bracket rate which many do not effectively pay with deductions and credits.

lnnbzt,Avionics_Engineer06,"Retirement Worries

Do you all wonder if what we are doing in steps 4,5,6,7 is worth it? For example, many people die fairly young. One side of my family, my grandparents had passed away by their early to mid-60s. 

My current plan has me retiring at 65, I am in my early-30s. But even at my age, I have seen people retire from work at 61 or 62 and just a few months later we hear of their passing.

It really scares me to know that I was gazelle intense in the beginning and I am very intentional with my money to just at the end to finally get to retirement to enjoy it to have your life cut short. I know nothing in life is a certainty but do you feel that you may be doing it all for nothing?

I know that it would get passed down to my spouse and children and donated but it does make one think if we should be enjoying some now. I do use a portion of my money for fun but me thinking about all that money there in retirement makes me honestly feel like a mule. No one can predict the future I may live to be 90 so the money needs to be there but does anyone have these feelings?",Yes,Yes,No,Yes,Yes
lxwrjd,Avionics_Engineer06,"Roth or Traditional For Higher Incomes

The question above stands for the following reasons.

I am 33 and make 150K or so a year. With this income, I am able to save about 40% of my income which allows me to max out my Roth 401K, my wife's, and I Roth IRAs and still contribute $800 to a taxable brokerage account per month.

I don't want to pay down my 2.25% mortgage faster than what is required. I am debt-free except for the house, I also do not plan to stay here long term and would rather let my money grow and be more liquid.

Back to the original question, I know that conventional Roth advice is best followed because it is easy for those who may not have the phycological willpower to follow more complicated plans. However, I think I would end up with more money by the time I retire if I maxed out the traditional 401K, then moved to the Traditional IRA, then invested the savings I get with deferring taxes into my brokerage account. I have read in-depth analysis from three different sources that seem to bear the math out.

Since we do not know what tax rates are going to do in the future, and if one is indeed disciplined enough to invest the savings from the traditional tax deferral strategy, wouldn't it be better to invest in the traditional sense?

Finally, I plan to retire in my early to mid-50s. Wouldn't that also more difficult with a majority of Roth contributions with the current rules in place?",Yes,Yes,No,No,No

Let me start by saying I max out Roth 401K, Roth IRA, HSA, and put extra into my taxable brokerage account.

I have 4 kids, is it worth putting extra money into a 529 for each kid for college?

I have not contributed to 529 for any kids thus far because I am uneasy about the restrictions on using the money and as a family, we have moved to several states in the pursuit of better opportunities. (states have different treatment on taxes for rollovers for example and that would be a lot of admin work to keep track of all the accounts). Not to mention we do not know the future, as in will they choose to go to college, or will the college pricing scheme be different in the future.

It was never my intention to give them full rides as I believe it helps build character if they have skin in the game for their education.

zrvfdp,Avionics_Engineer06,"Moxie Solar Company Went Bankrupt with 30K of our money any Options?

My family and I contracted a local solar company (Moxie Solar) to install solar panels on my home. It was something we thought about doing for a long time, did our research on and decided to go with them as at the time they had good reviews, and several of my co-workers have systems that were installed by them.

They have a milestone based contract that is in 4 parts. 25% due on signing, 25% due on completion of Utility approvals City Permits etc, 25% due upon installation, 25% due when turned on with approval of the utility company. ...

Anyway, I just finished getting approval from the city and my local utility company, paid my second portion, and not a week later the company went bankrupt!

There were two options when we decided to purchase:

1. Take the loan with one of their partners. 0% interest however they get it back by adding 15K to the cost of the job.

2. Pay in cash or get your own loan. I have the cash but decided to get a loan because the rates are low and I expected the system to pay for itself so to speak over time. Rather than paying a power bill I would just pay the solar bill. Cash/Financing on your own allowed me to get a really good rate and a heavy discount on the work over the life of the loan.

Anyway I feel stupid because if I would have gone with their solution I would have put no money down as they get paid by the bank at job completion. (one of our family friends did this and their loan/contract was canceled).

Here I was thinking I was doing the smart thing by either paying cash or financing at a low rate. But I am not the one who is out 30K while others got their contracts canceled.

I did the last payment in ACH so I hope I can get that back with fraud protection. So in the best case scenario I am only out 15K.

But as a customer I am considered an unsecured creditor at the bottom of the list to get paid back.

Here are the things I have done so far:

1. Filed a complaint with the state attorney general's office.

2. Called several lawyers but was advised they could not help since once they going into bankruptcy all cases against them cease and are not allowed to go forward.

3. Called my back to get the last payment ACH reversed. The first payment was outside of the window to get back.

Anyone have any ideas or am I just plain screwed?

From now on I will only pay for services upon completion. I know certain contractors/businesses will not like that but its the way it has to be to protect myself.

My worry is that the landlord will either try to keep my deposit or delay giving it to me. I do not currently have enough cash on hand for a deposit on another place.

Unless thereâ€™s a huge market crash soon my prospects of owning a SFH are dire. Me and my wife make $90k but live in a relatively high COL area. A turn key movie in ready house is upwards of $400k even in less desirable neighborhoods. In nice neighborhoods like $600k or more.

My tentative plan at this point is to save *at least* $500 every single month for the next 7 years which would mean I would have $52k+ in cash by that time. I picked 35 as an arbitrary age because if I take a 30 yr fixed mortgage at 35, I will own my home by retirement age.

17dxl0r,Basic_Butterscotch,"Help me understand home-ownership better.

I'm turning 29 in a couple of months and I'm getting really anxious to buy a house. 

I've found a couple of very nice move-in ready townhomes in decent neighborhoods for about $300k (Philadelphia suburbs). I have the 3.5% plus closing costs to put down with a FHA loan. The all-in monthly payment (mortgage, taxes, PMI) would be about $2,600. 

I'm an hourly employee currently earning $38/hr. I'm usually working at least a small amount of overtime every month. Last year my W2 said I made $84k.

On an average month my take-home pay is about $4500 after taxes, health insurance, and some money to my 401k. 

I realize as a home-owner you have to pay all utilities (gas, water, sewer, electric, gas) so I would say at most $400. 

I'm pretty confident I could live off of $1,500/mo if I cut unnecessary spending. I have no car payment. Insurance+gas is maybe $200, food $500 on the high end. I'm single. I currently rent for $1,500/mo and I currently spend a lot of money on hobbies because I have the disposable income to do so, but I plan to stop doing that now that I'm serious about buying. 

But here's the other thing, and where I may be wrong in my logic. I've never not gotten a 3% raise at work. In 5 years I'll be making $93k/yr. In 15 years, $124k/yr. And my mortgage will still be $2,600/mo? Actually less at some point when I hit 20% equity and drop the PMI and it will be even less. Maybe at some point in the next 5-10 years, the fed will start dropping rates and I can refinance.

Obviously nothing is guaranteed. I work in healthcare so long term unemployment seems extremely unlikely, but I guess possible. 

The thing that's pushing me into buying is that in 15 years I don't think it's a stretch to imagine a 2 bedroom apartment renting for $2,600/mo at the rate things are going. I guess that's ""FOMO"" but I really see no indication that housing affordability is going to come back to reality any time soon.",No,Yes,No,No,Yes

I work in healthcare so I can get a job anywhere there is a hospital, but the pay will be less. In a place like that I wouldn't be surprised if I had to take a pay cut as low as $50k/yr.

I make $80k/yr ($4,500/mo net) and my set monthly expenses are around $3000/mo.

The breakdown for that is

$1350 rent

$200 utilities

$125 cell phone + home internet

$300 car payment + $200 insurance/gas = $500 (Car is a 2020 Kia Forte and I only owe about $5k on it)

$280 student loan (~$30k balance) 

$100 cat food + litter 

~$500 food, toiletries, etc 

I have $15k in cash savings right now and I save between $1-1.5k/mo. Part of the reason why I don't have more saved is because I had to spend a lot of money on orthodontics to fix my jacked up teeth, but I digress. 

My dream is to buy a house. I'm 28 years old and feel like I kind of got a late start in life. I was kind of a bum and didn't graduate college until 2019. My first job only paid $40k/yr, I just started my current high paying job 6 months ago. 

I live in a very expensive area apparently. I didn't choose this area, it's where I was born. I would prefer to stay nearby because my parents are older and I'm really close with them. Anyway, all of that to say that an affordable home in this area is like $300k and a nice house is easily $500k+. 

So to cut to the chase, is this something I can actually even afford? If I really put my nose to the grindstone and save hard, I could have about $50k to put down in 2 years from now. Also my car would be paid off at that point and I maybe might also be making a little bit more money, although I don't expect to be making a lot more. 

The mortgage payment on a $300k house if I put $50k down would be $2,300. So that would cut my disposable income/saving money down to just $500/mo. Just thinking about this feels... claustrophobic.

Townhouses around here are about $300k, SFH start at $400k and nice ones are a lot more.

My currently monthly outflow is about $3k/mo. $1500 of that is rent + utilities. The rest covers food, car insurance, gas, home essentials, and food/litter for my cat. I make a concerted effort to put most of the remaining $1k into savings every month, but occasionally spend a couple hundred on myself.

Even in the best case scenario where I have 20% down (which will take many years to get there) and interest rates come down to 4% again (I know, extremely unlikely), I STILL probably could not realistically afford $375k. 

You might wonder why a single, childless guy wants a house. Well, I just like the idea of having my own space, being able to do whatever renovations I want. A place that nobody can take away from me or evict me from. A place where I don't have to worry about paying rent when I'm 70 years old.

Apart from that, I looked at my CC statement (**I just use it for reward points and pay it off every month**) and I spent about $1,300. I'm not going to itemize every transaction but I know I spend about $5-7/day on lunch at the cafeteria at my job, most days I have either an iced coffee or a monster drink, which I KNOW is a waste of money but it's also a small pleasure that helps me get thru the day. I spent $500 at Wal-Mart which was for food, home essentials (toilet paper, etc.), and cat food/litter for my cat. I spent $110 on gas for my car. $40 on a haircut. $30 for a new pair of work pants at Kohls. About $200 was for Christmas gift which obviously isn't a recurring expense.

i783sp,bcampeon,"Need a little assistance understanding payroll taxes

Ok, so now that all this payroll holiday stuff has been come in the news, its had me do the math on my own taxes to verify to see if they're correct or how they should be. Quick insight:  


I have my standard salary, and receive an additional small commission every month on the first paycheck of the month and I get paid every 2 weeks.  


I also have health insurance that of course my employer pays a portion of the premium and he also takes out that portion of the premium out of the first check of the month. The health insurance was just initially offered last year, so when this was set up, what they would do was before listing my actual gross salary for that pay period, they would deduct the premium from it and then tax it. So for example, if my gross salary is 1500, they subtract lets say 200 for the premium, so listed my gross salary as 1300 and tax the AGI accordingly. So I was ok with this, because even though my records weren't shown as me making my full salary, I at least know that I was being taxed correctly because as far as I know, health insurance premiums should be deducted from your gross salary pre-tax.  


This year however, they are listing my full gross salary for the pay period + commissions and what not, and I did the math on that for FICA/Medicare and it came out to the 7.65% tax amount. And at the end, they deduct the health insurance premium and deduct it as a Misc 1T deduction.  


Will I be able to get this/portion of this money back when I file my taxes given that its for health insurance premiums and it looks like by my math, its being deducted post-tax? I quickly tired looking up some information and it says that miscellaneous deductions can only claimed if i itemize my taxes. And with that said, I'm not sure if I'll be able to itemize more than the standard.

Hello all,  


I just recently opened a Roth IRA with Charles Schwab and to get started, I just went with a target date fund just to ""start the clock"" with my investing. But in that time, I've been researching and reading more information to better familiarize myself with everything and so I decided I want to be a little more ""active"" with my investing, in the sense of going with the 3 fund portfolio recommended from Bogleheads. So my question, do I have to sell the initial shares of the TDF I bought and then I buy the shares in accordance to the 3 fund portfolio?",Yes,Yes,Yes,No,No
jh9iwp,bcampeon,"Trying to decide if it's worth refinancing / would you do this?

Purchased current home in 10/2017 for 200,900 with loan of 194k at 3.99% with P&amp;I at $929 and PMI at $102.

Once the COVID-19 situation started and the rates started to drop, I refinanced right in the beginning in March down to 3.25% on a $190k for a monthly of $827, was able to get appraisal waiver, closing costs at $2.5k, and was able to drop PMI, so I effectively dropped my monthly payment down by about $204.

Therefore, I would be able to recoup my closing costs in about 10 months, which would be January 2021 about for me.

So what I'm trying to decide is, if it would be worth it for me to refinance once again with the rates being just slightly lower, and buying the interest rate down even more. My current loan balance right now is at about $188,113. Just for curiosity I checked the rates on Bankrate for a few lenders and the amount of points they're charging to bring the interest rate down to around 2.5% is in the range of $3.6k-$4.2k. I should be able to get another appraisal waiver and I work with a closing attorney so I would be able to waive pretty much all settlement fees and just pay a few items at cost so that would help keep closing costs lower.

So if I just dropped the interest rate down to 2.5%, it'd drop my monthly down to about $743-751 (depending how much of the costs I'd decide to roll into the loan) resulting in about $76-$84 monthly savings.

So the reason I'm trying to decide if I should refinance is to see if I can find lenders who haven't started to include the market adverse fee coming up in their fees (if possible) but overall just to start the ""savings"".

I know how to calculate the math and all that. We have no plans of moving from this house whatsoever in the near future, and don't have no long term plan of considering moving say in the next 5-6 years. But even if we did, I think I'd be willing to try to put the house up for rent instead of trying to sell it and continue building equity. If I had a monthly payment in the $740 range, taxes and insurance comes out to about $220 a month (I don't have an escrow account, I manage myself), and in current market I'm sure I could possibly rent this place out for about $1.3-1.4k conservatively and so I imagine 5-6 years down in the future I could probably rent for more.

So my question is, is this something you all would consider would be worth doing?

&amp;#x200B;

Edit: I want to rephrase the overall/actual question. Is this something you all would consider would be worth doing with the intention of possibly renting the house out in the future?",Yes,Yes,No,Yes,No

My wife got a referral to have a head CT scan done by her doctor and the procedure of course went through the insurance to make sure it was approved first.

After the procedure was said and done, she paid the amount we were told the day of at the hospital for $446. We got our EOB afterwards stating that was the amount we would owe and so we thought that was that. The EOB also states that the services were provided by the hospital.

Well, just a couple of days ago, we got another bill for $543.99 after adjustments ($846 originally) from Quantum Radiology PC. We weren't told or advised we would be receiving a separate bill from a different group/doctor and assumed the original $446 was everything included given we went in network for everything and also received approval for everything upfront with the amount we would be expected to pay.

thlpl0,bcampeon,"Questions in preparing for a 401k early withdrawal

My dad is planning on taking SOME money out of his 401k as an early withdrawal. I've tried talking him out of it, but he has fully decided on it. He is leaving his job to be able to do so as his current 401k plan company is not allowing him to withdraw any money, so I've helped him with opening a traditional IRA with Merrill Edge as he banks with BofA and he wants to keep everything consolidated.

The thing I'm wondering is what would be the best way to go about it? He is currently fully invested in Principal LifeTime Hybrid 2035 CIT X, a target date fund. Should he sell all his shares before rolling over to ME and just roll over the cash? Or would it just be easier to roll everything over as is and leave the investments in ME as is?

Also, I don't have much experience with ME funds. Are there any target date funds one could recommend with ME that I could look into for him without having to pay any fees? Like are there ME target date index funds like Schwab has that he could buy?

And lastly, it is my understanding the federal and state taxes can be withheld and taken from his 401k balance, but he would actually need to have the money for the 10% penalty for tax season next year. Is this true? I plan on calling ME with him to confirm as well, but just want to get a head start on some general info with people who might have had some experience with this.

Any other suggestions or things to look out for would be greatly appreciated.",Yes,Yes,No,Yes,No
xnm51x,bcampeon,"Should I invest less in my HSA?

I am currently 31 years old, married, no kids and make $70k/year and have had a HDHP with access to a HSA at work since I started my current job last year. My wife doesn't work. I currently have my paychecks set up to max out my HSA for this year so $280.77 is taken out of my check bi-weekly ($7300/year) and so far have a total contributed amount of $9610.63, although the balance is lower since I have the money invested and market is down.

The rest of my investment contributions are $150/month into a ROTH IRA for both me and my wife ($300/month, $3600/year) and I'm also putting $100/month ($1200/year) into a joint taxable brokerage account.

My question is, should I contribute less to my HSA and contribute more to our ROTHs? I've been prioritizing HSA contributions due to the triple tax advantage (I have been saving receipts for all our medical stuff). and also to lower my AGI some for the tax year since ROTH contributions aren't tax deductible (although if I understand it correctly, I might be able to get a small break for the Saver's Tax Credit).

 Following the usual guideline of saving 15% of income for retirement, that figure for us is $10,500 and with these amounts, it puts us at $10,900, not including the money put in the taxable brokerage account.

In the case of the taxable brokerage account, the reason I started that is to start growing additional money on the side for other things outside of our emergency fund that might come up in the future to ensure we have extra funds (major home repairs, car purchase, etc) that we could liquidate and still not have to dip into the emergency fund first. Or if it we end up not needing it for those kinds of things, it would just be extra money we have for the future.

So what do you all think of this current set up?",No,Yes,No,No,No
xnnrut,bcampeon,"What's a good investment plan for 53 year old with Merrill Edge

Long story short, my dad recently rolled over his 401k into a IRA at the end of March/beginning of April (pretty good timing given that was the last highest point the market has been at this year) and hasn't reinvested the money since.

He has $200k sitting and so I've been asking him if he's ok with me reinvesting his money, especially now that the market is down, and he seems to be ok with me doing it now for him as he doesn't really understand markets/investing.

He went with Merrill Edge since he banks with BofA and just wanted to keep it all in one place and also benefit from the Platinum Honors with them.

I'm planning on DCA'ing his money in case the market keeps going down, it doesn't freak him out too much. But I'm also not familiar with ETF's as I have my accounts through Schwab and am more familiar with their mutual funds.

Any suggestions as to what funds/ETFs I should invest his money in, especially given his age? I'm planning on following Bogle's 3 fund portfolio, but I'll be honest, I don't 100% understand the bond allocation part of it. But my basic understanding is that if interest rates are high (like they are now and possible to continue rising), then bonds will go down? I've looked up some bond ETF/funds and that does seem to be the case.

And I'm also wary of international stocks just because of their performance, but do also understand that past performance does not dictate future performance, so what I was thinking is just doing 100% into VTI/SCHB so he gets the full US market (large,mid,small caps).

ewgtsc,Bigmealplantime,"My sizable trading loss this week may have given me the biggest lesson in retirement planning

The only major dives I've taken in trading have been with options. I know I'm not alone in this. It's a massive math animal that just happens to work reasonably well, unless you slip up just a little bit.

But I do enjoy the research, the math, and the thrill. But I'm also starting to realize why people have a retirement fund separate from the rest of their money. And as much fun as trading is, I finally realize why people say it's hard to beat the market. In the last 3 months, after this loss, I'm level with the S&amp;P. And a LOT more stressed out (and getting concerned trading takes too much time away from my day job or having a life), and very full of ""if I'd just fucking sold this x then"" remorse that just ruins my happiness.

I don't really have the money to invest in theta and sell options, or it'd be a damn slow start and a LOT more learning.

So I remembered my grandpa always talking about his dividends, and this article I read about investing in the S&amp;P as your retirement fund. Then I read a ton about QE and world markets and realized how dumb I was for selling those calls (well maybe, we'll see). I also learned by just investing in the S&amp;P, it's good because the leverage resets daily so I don't start losing tons from decay. And the fees are reasonable. And it's managed, with Apple being a majority holding, not just a ""bunch of standard and poor banks and old companies and shit"". And there are **dividends** which you can **reinvest**.

Suddenly I see why ""average"" people think putting money away for retirement is a savings account, and why they're worried. And why so many guys day trading or swing trading end up saying ""you can't beat the market"". And why the happiest people I've ever met just say how they put some money into their IRA every month and into whatever ETF/fund they like (and even then how some screw it up and pick just a sector ETF they think is great). I did this for a while, and was left scratching my head as to why I wouldn't just trade with the money, make more, and get to spend it. But then you run a compound interest calculator with reinvested dividends, and you see **huge numbers that if divided over the years it took of saving/building, would be equal to having a 2nd high paying job.** Without the stress of thumbing around on Robinhood at 9am scrambling to maintain your 25% of growth which you end up losing half of. Not to mention who looks forward to a life of that? I'd rather live within my means without the ups and downs, and look forward to retiring at 50 if I so choose.

I think I get you guys. Or at least a little bit better.

Here's what I'm proposing I do with my money - interested in your feedback:

1. Chop off 5% to keep in Robinhood to play with
2. Keep 45% in my savings account for liquidity
3. 25% into my IRA, into SPYD, and contribute $5k/year
4. 25% into my bank's brokerage account (so I don't feel the urge to fuck with it) into a few solid tech stocks, then split off $5k/year from this (assuming it doesn't flop) into my IRA. Not using an IRA here so the funds remain available as my readily-available rainy day fund

Thanks for reading. It's been a hell of a week and I'm glad I learned something.",Yes,Yes,No,Yes,Yes
f7lvba,Bigmealplantime,"How do I make more money?

I realize that subject is casting a huge net, and I'm saying it with a little bit of humor. But I'm looking for ways to boost my income at least 10-20% over the next year. I'll try to make this post as objective and as organized as possible. Hoping some of you have some helpful suggestions that will spark some attainable ideas for me. I'm mainly looking for small things I might be able to work to add to what I already do - not looking for a major life change or anything.

**Background:** I'm in my mid-30s, I have a BS in management but a very strong IT background. I attended school for IT and pharmacology briefly too. I live in NYC, so there's plenty of opportunity.

**What I do now:** I've helped run a small logistics business for the last 6-7 years, specifically the IT/finance/managerial aspects of it. My day job isn't the highest paying, but it allows me to work from home and control my hours - most weeks I can get everything done in 30 hours or so. This is key, as a ""normal"" job that pays double would easily consume double the hours and restrict my freedom to explore other things. Plus, it's enjoyable working with a few close friends and I do believe this is a *killer* resume builder for the day that we have to move on. Ideally, we'd like to sell the business within a few years (we've sold 2 in the past already).

I do work in nightclubs as a lighting tech on weekends. I do have to limit this a little bit, or I find that the late nights/lack of sleep take a toll on my day job. I enjoy it, and try to expand my knowledge here, but lately I've been hitting a limit on time I have to take online courses and such.

I also do some stock trading - I have over 10 years of experience in this, but have only begun really honing it in the last 2 years or so. I understand very very few people can turn this into true income (and not eat losses that set them back), but I truly do enjoy learning more about the market, world economics, and trading techniques. I'm up the last 3 years, but it's not consistent, so I limit my trading portfolio to a relatively small amount now and consider anything I make to be a bonus.

**My strong points &amp; what I like doing:** Aside from the above, I consider myself to have very strong tech skills, and I can learn more extremely quickly. I've been placed in some high pressure IT situations and have never truly failed. I believe this is where I enjoy trading - I can do it in between other work, there's a huge technical/mathematical component to it, and it doesn't require a constant commitment (meaning I can stop for a month if my main job requires it). 

I also enjoy the medical field, pharmacology, and seeing how that can help people. Even had a doctor recently ask why I'm not a doctor - pretty flattering, but I have a long way to go lol. Unfortunately, it seems nearly any real money to be made here would require a major life change, and isn't just something I can dabble in on the side. For a while I was trading pharma stocks to try to merge those interests, but it's just too time intensive and unstable.

Other interests include pretty much anything tech, passive money making schemes, and fitness. After a money-sucking relationship the last couple years, I've also taken a lot more interest in improving my budgeting skills, so I have been saving a lot more too.

**People who know me come to me for:** tech things, stock trading stuff (how things work, not ""tips""), and ways to solve their small medical ailments. 

**One of the best professional compliments I've received:** while on a business trip, the leader of several PhD software engineers told others he was extremely impressed meeting someone with such a great blend of technical and business knowledge.

&amp;#x200B;

Again, not looking to go back to school, change jobs, or make another huge change. Just exploring ideas for something I can add to what I already do to make a little more. Really my end goal is to give myself a little more spending money for time out with friends, to travel a little more, or to buy myself a new desk chair finally, lol.

Pretty straightforward question I suppose...being aware of the 20%+ in taxes charged on trading profits, Iâ€™m curious how much I can put into my IRA annually. Iâ€™ve heard $6k, but is that total, or just the amount I can contribute and then write off?

Basically Iâ€™d want to do this so that I can use profits from stock trading towards more trading, thus giving me the chance to grow my account more rapidly (rather than getting 1/4 of it wiped out annually). In the end Iâ€™d obviously be paying taxes on it anyways, but deferring would give me more capital to work with now. 

I also figure then if a few years go by, and something terrible happens to my trading account, I wouldnâ€™t be as much in the gutter as if Iâ€™d paid those taxes annually on gains that I eventually ended up losing.

Y is a really good friend of mine, I trust him, and he says X's dad is the beneficiary and also a pretty big piece of crap who's likely to just take the money X and Y made for his own enjoyment.

We visited the bank, and sure enough, Y's name isn't on the account so he can't withdraw.

I have more experience in the LLC part of things, and suggested he just file a similar name in another state via registered agent to continue operating. The bank account is the bigger challenge.

I was suggesting he try to casually get the dad to transfer everything over for the sole reason of Y continuing the business. Fill out the paperwork and everything and hope the dad doesn't think about it too much as long as it's easy for him.

is9uae,Bigmealplantime,"Credit utilization

Long story short, my credit utilization isn't high, but it's definitely the biggest impact on my credit right now. Mainly because Amex doesn't count my business card credit limit towards my personal credit.

I ask as I'm considering moving some of my business Amex credit to my (mostly unused) personal Amex, versus requesting limit increases on my 2 Visa cards (Uber and Amazon) that I actually do use heavily. Moving the credit within Amex would be much easier of course. But will it help get my utilization down and my score up?",No,Yes,No,No,No

n3yvvp,Bigmealplantime,"$20k inheritance, looking for suggestions on best use

Hi all,

I recently got $20k from the sale of my late grandfather's car.

My parents were originally going to cut me $1k/month from it for extra income. While this is nice, I feel the money would quickly go to waste.

I consider myself pretty skilled in investments. After my grandpa's death, my family now refers to me as the investment savvy one. But of course, I don't know everything.

I did have an ex drain my life savings a few years ago, so I wouldn't be opposed to using it to build that back up and have a nice rainy day fund. Used to keep a nice $60k on hand split between savings and investments, but that's almost toast now.

Similar to above, I do budget $500/mo for retirement savings currently (more if I wouldn't max out my IRA contribution), so could do that for the next few years and/or use the extra $500 to rebuild my savings.

My retirement fund (I'm 36) could use a lot of work as well. I've been self employed for a decade, so I don't have a 401k to really build it up. So I have considered dumping it all into my IRA and into the S&amp;P via either SPY or VOO.

Hi all, I have to replace my stolen iPhone and am also planning to replace my old Macbook Pro with a new model once those are released.

Normally I finance the iPhone through Citizens bank (Apple's partner) but I see they now encourage the option of doing the same on an Apple Card. The 3% discount is nice, but not really a big deal versus screwing up my credit history. I normally buy everything I own outright, but I do finance the phones to keep my credit up. This also has me considering doing the same with a new Macbook as there's no interest being charged, and it would keep more cash liquid to me in the meantime.

I don't have a need to spread these out, I could just buy outright, but thinking in the interest of keeping cash in my account, getting a small discount, and avoiding financing through the clunky Citizen's website. Otherwise, I'm not one to sign up for new cards for small discounts.

My partner made $116,000 gross income in 2022, this year it will likely be closer to $130,000 because of a raise.

Hi! As the title says, my soon to be wife and I are getting married on April 27, and we just became aware that contributing to an HSA (mine) and general purpose FSA (my soon to be wife's) will be problematic.

* She allotted $350 in her general purpose/employer Health Equity FSA this year, and is contributing $6.50 per weekly paycheck, so will be about $110 through April. We called her HR department, and they said **she is able to cancel her FSA** as marriage is a qualifying life event. Does this allow me to continue contributing to the HSA?
* Or does her having an FSA for any amount of time this plan year (2023) then disqualify me from contributing to my HSA for the rest of the year even if she cancels her FSA? 
* By end of April, I will have contributed $1,440.20 to my HSA.

Hi there, in April I [posted](https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/12pp8nq/getting_married_soon_and_spouse_has_an_fsa_i_have/) in this sub looking for some help. My spouse and I were getting married soon and she had an FSA, and I had (and currently have) a self-only HSA. Having learned that having both an FSA and HSA would be an issue, she canceled her FSA on April 26 (within the month of our marriage) so that I could continue contributing to my HSA, which I've done throughout this year. I will reach the self-only coverage HSA contribution max on my final paycheck next week, $3,850. 

However, my spouse recently was notified by her FSA provider, Health Equity, that she still has an available balance of $237.99 on her FSA. This balance is from contributions before our marriage date, and before she canceled her FSA. [Here's a screenshot](https://imgur.com/a/UEzh1i4) of her FSA contributions, which total $114.41. She then spent $112.01 of this at the FSA store on April 20, before cancelling the FSA on April 26. There is a $350 election amount that processed January 1 (so $237.99 remaining).

1. I'm hoping my HSA contributions this year are still eligible, and will not have to be withdrawn or subject to any penalties, given that she canceled her FSA prior to our marriageâ€”but we are confused as to why there is still an available FSA balance. Would anyone be able to confirm if my HSA contributions this year are in the clear given she canceled her FSA prior to us getting married?
2. Is she still able to spend this available FSA balance without triggering any penalty on my end for having an HSA this year? Again, she canceled her FSA prior to our marriage, but has a remaining balance. The ""claim by"" date lists 7/25/23, and the ""use from"" date range is 1/1/23 to 4/26/23 (when she canceled it).

I was under the impression Wash Sale would not be triggered by selling VXUS and buying IXUS, which trades on a different index and holds a different amount of stocks in the ETF.

Anyone know why this happened? Am I screwed? What happens now? Thanks.

The disclaimer at the bottom of the page for wash sale says:

*""Adjusted due to previous wash sale disallowed loss. If you sell shares at a loss and you purchase additional shares of the same or a substantially identical security (in the same or a different account) within the 61 day period that begins 30 days before and ends 30 days after the sale, the purchase may result in a wash sale. If a wash sale occurs, the loss from the transaction should be ""disallowed"" for tax purposes, and the amount of the loss should be added to the cost basis of the newly-purchased shares. Unless otherwise requested or noted, Fidelity adjusts cost basis information related to newly-purchased shares when a wash sale occurs within an account as the result of an identical security purchase. Fidelity does not report disallowed losses or adjust cost basis information related to wash sales triggered by sales and purchases of the same security within different accounts or by sales and purchases of substantially identical securities within the same or different accounts.

Just looking for a sanity check.

Say you and your SO are 30yo. You max 2 traditional 401ks for 10 years and then contribute nothing for the following 25 years. At 65yo you retire.

A compound interest calc says that youâ€™d have about $1.9MM in today dollars if the market averaged 5% real returns, which I think is a bit conservative as a rate of return. A 4% yearly withdrawal rate gives you about $76k in annual â€œincomeâ€. If your spend now (at 30yo) is less than that, youâ€™re good right? 

I guess you need to factor in the cost of medical care, which I donâ€™t understand yet. But my approximations are ok up to that point, right?

That ror is inflation adjusted. I think nominal is 10%, inflation adjusted is 7%, and I used 5% to be conservative. So Iâ€™m comparing today dollars to today cost of living for this projection.

I make $112k as a Software Engineer in Seattle.

I also got approved for the full $20k so realistically if it goes through I could pay off the rest of the $6k by June. I have about $8k in stock sitting in my brokerage account that I am not sure what to do with. However, my credit score took a big hit from the CC debt, so I am sitting at below mid 500â€™s right now. Since I paid off my CC debt I am hoping I can get to the 700s quickly.


I have a fully paid off car that I bought with cash so my bills are low which is only about $200-300 for groceries and $2650 for my current rent. Other than that my expenses are very low. I also just paid off all of my CC debt which was about $7k.

I currently budget using using the envelope method and wanted to see how other people handle savings they put into brokerage/retirement accounts and how it impacts cash flow. Currently, I have my monthly envelopes set up along with goal/annual envelopes for Emergency Savings (at my goal so it is full with no more transactions), Short Term Savings, Home/Car Repairs, Vacation, and Investing. My monthly budget is below my base salary so what I do each month is at the beginning of the month fill the monthly envelopes and then at the end of the month I put the remaining cash into the various goal envelopes accounting for any that may have gone over those month or potentially extra from working overtime. Currently when I then deposit the money in the Investing category into my brokerage or Roth IRA, I put it through as a debit transaction. If I need to use this money I would then put it through as an income transaction and a subsequent debit transaction. This had always made sense to me to do it this way but I have been thinking about it more and am wondering if this the right way to do it since really this money is technically no different than the money sitting in the full Emergency Savings envelope, other than have a higher risk for potentially higher reward. For cash flow tracking purposes, I then take the investment debit transactions out of the monthly cashflow tracking and combine it into one annual debit so it is not tracked in monthly cash flow but is in annual cash flow.

If our car is in the shop, I could possibly get a ride with a coworker, but thatâ€™s not guaranteed. My wife would also be at home with the baby and no car in case of an emergency. Unfortunately public transportation is limited. 
I see our options as:
-trade in the equinox for something larger, roughly a $550-600 payment. This would stretch the budget a bit but we can swing it. Weâ€™re just not sure if we want to do that with having a new baby. 
-keep the equinox and make due with that for a bit. Iâ€™m hoping for a promotion soon, which would be a significant pay increase. New car payment would be about $750-800 if we also kept the equinox. We would be able to comfortably make both payments until 2025.
-buy an older larger vehicle in cash. Having trouble finding anything reasonable in this market.

17bj53d,blindmike95,"Should my wife quit her job?

We have a bit of a unique situation, and are wondering whether my wife should quit her job or stay. 
We live and rent our home in Connecticut, so cost of living is fairly high. I can't drive, so my wife has to drive me to and from work daily. This is only a 15 minute commute, but unfortunately it crosses state lines so I can't use public transportation. My job provides our health insurance, a penssion if I stay long enough, and enough money to cover our fixed monthly expenses, plus a couple hundred extra. 
My wife started her job 3 years ago at $15/hr, and now makes $16.40/hr. We just had our first child, and she was promised a raise 30 days after returning from maternity leave. After 30 days, she was told that she needed to wait another 30 days and that her request for  a raise would be re-evaluated at that time. This is coming from the CEO of the company, and at this point it's not looking like a raise is very likely. She does work from home, but unfortunately the requirements of the job are too demanding, so she can't watch our son. A family friend is watching him for $200 a week. However, the total daily commute for my wife to drive me to and from work, and our son to and from our friend's house, is 75 miles and 3 hours. This makes for an 11 hour day for my wife. After the expense of daycare and fuel, my wife's take home pay is $1000 a month, which we need to cover groceries and other expenses. This isn't considering extra car maintenance, depreciation, etc. Driving our son to and from our friend's house for daycare is an extra 520 miles a month, as compared to just driving me to and from work. We've been averaging about 2,000 miles a month between work and personal driving. We only currently have one vehicle with just over 51,000 miles, so this isn't a huge issue for the short term. 
We have just under $17,000 in savings, and are trying to decide whether my wife should quit her job as we get closer to the winter months. My father owns a small moving business and is hoping to be able to hire her within a few months to do bookkeeping, scheduling, and other office work, but this isn't a 100% guarantee. There are also some opportunities through people he works with to sell items on eBay and Facebook marketplace, but this also wouldn't be a guaranteed income. 
If my wife needed to find another full time job after quitting this one, she would need the flexibility to be able to pick up and drop off myself and our son, which might be an issue for some companies. 
What would you all do in our situation? She's leaning toward quitting, but losing the guaranteed paycheck is scary, especially with a new baby.",No,Yes,No,Yes,Yes

My fiance and I are going to be getting married later this year, and we're looking at taking out life insurance policies. We are currently renting but are planning on buying a house within the next 2 years, and also having kids. The plan is to have 2 kids. House will probably be in the $300k price range. Right now I make about $42k a year and she makes about $32k. I'm 26 and she's 21. We're not sure how much life insurance to purchase or what term to choose. What coverage amounts and term length would you all recommend? Does it make sense to start with a shorter term now and cancel/replace it in 5-10 years?

Me:
10 year term - $10.19 monthly
20 year term - $12.95 monthly
30 year term - $18.47 monthly

Fiance:
10 year term - $9.13 monthly

30 year term - $24.20 monthly

By going with Amica we also get a $37 discount on our 6 month auto policy. 

I can also get group life insurance from my employer. This is a term life policy from Metlife that I have the option of porting to a non-group policy if I leave the company. Coverage amount can be up to 8x my annual salary.

My fiancee and I are looking over our insurance policies and trying to figure out if we have the right amount of coverage.

tb5nqc,blindmike95,"Weighing pros and cons of staying at my pension job long term

Hi all,

I'm trying to figure out whether it makes more financial sense to stay at my state pension job long term, or if I would be better off going somewhere else where I can make a higher salary. Trying to figure this out is making my head spin!
I'm 26, and currently work in an entry-level IT position making $20/hr. I've been here for about a year and a half. Within the next few years the person ahead of me will be retiring, and I expect to take her position. My guess is that she makes about $65k/year. There probably wouldn't be room for me to move up after this point. This company has a union, so on average we get 2-3% raises every 2-3 years. This job has a pension, so we don't pay into social security. The health insurance is also pretty cheap (just under $400 a month for the family plan) with low deductibles and copays. 
I could leave this position and go to the public secter, and increase my salary, but that would mean losing the pension and paying into social security. How much more would I need to make in order to justify doing this? I'm trying to figure out if the better long-term option is to stay for a slightly lower salary and the pension, or leave for a potentially higher salary and lose the pension. 

Here is some info on the pension:
vested after 10 years
A public employee retirement allowance consists of two parts: an annuity and a pension. The contributions that are deducted during the course of your creditable service are deposited for you in an annuity savings fund by your retirement board. The interest that accrues on these contributions is credited to your individual account. The part of your retirement allowance that is based on the total amount in your annuity savings account on the date of your retirement is the annuity.
A pension is the difference between the total retirement allowance specified by law and the annuity as described above.
The superannuation retirement allowance of any member may not exceed 80% of his or her five-year average annual rate of regular compensation.

The retirement allowance calculation is 
benefit rate x Your Highest Five Year Average Annual Rate of Compensation x creditable service

Assuming at least 30 years of creditable service, benefit rates are:
67 or older, 2.50%
66, 2.375%
65, 2.250%
64, 2.125%
63, 2.0%
62, 1.875%

Benefit rates are slightly lower for less than 30 years of service. I can provide if needed.

xl0l0l,blindmike95,"Which credit card should we use for everday spending?

Hi all,

We have a few credit cards and are debating on which we should use for our daily spending. We want to use whichever card makes the most sense in terms of rewards and additional benefits, but also don't want to have to manage 4-5 cards with their balances, due dates, etc. 

The cards we have are:
 Costco Visa: earns rewards on travel, restaurants, gas, and Costco purchases, so we'll use that card in those categories. $6k limit, just signed up for this card since we recently moved near a Costco. 
BOA Customized Cash Rewards mastercard: earns 2% on groceries, 3% on a category of your choice (online purchases for us), on up to $2500 per quarter combined. This is the card we're currently using for misc everyday purchases. $37k limit. 
Capital One Quicksilver: Earns unlimited 1.5% cash back on all purchases. $5k limit which they don't seem to want to increase, probably since I got that card when I was trying to rebuild my credit a few years ago. 
Chase Amazon Visa: used mainly for Amazon purchases. $35k limit

We're not sure whether it makes more sense to use the BOA or Cap One card as our daily spending card. Cap One earns a bit more cash back, but it would be much easier to go over the 30% of credit limit mark since the credit line is so much smaller on that card. On average we spend about $1500 a month on credit cards (and pay off before interest is charged, of course). Whichever card we don't use regularly will just be used for a couple subscription services or something to keep it active.

My sibling visited me in USA and their baggage was lost during the international travel.  
The airlines is providing some compensation but they are sending a check to my US address on sibling's name.

As my sibling is not a US citizen or resident, they don't have any bank accounts here.

How can we cash this check?   
To add to this complexity, the check took 8 weeks to arrive and my sibling is back in their home country while the check is in my posession. I do have a copy of their passport ID if it helps.

Hello,

I am resident of CA and filed for STD with California EDD.

I have just received the first payment in the form of a check and I am a little confused on the stuff written on the backside.

There are a couple of fields on it and it tells me to report any other wages that I have/may recieve for the same pay period.

In my case, I am going to receive some payment from Employer & some from a STD Insurance provider (to make me 100% whole) -- 

* Do I need to report these payments?
* Do I need to do these every 2 weeks? as this form will be on the backside of every check I receive

I searched the internet and could not find any relevant information or video about the backside.

Would really appreciate insights from anyone who has been through this in CA state.

Thanks!

State of CA  
Mom - UnitedHealthcare HDHP Plan (3k Deductible)  
Dad - Aetna PPO Plan  
The plan was to always have the Baby on Dad's plan after Birth.  
We were under the impression that all bills related to the baby for the first 30 days will be covered under Mom's account -- while they are being charged to UHC correctly, UHC is treating it a a family plan now (6k Deductible) and have sent bills our way for the first 3 visits that occurred within the first 15 days of birth.  
**Is this correct? Will the baby have their own 3k deductible in the first 30 days?**  
Dad now has the new Aetna insurance card with Baby's name on it and ""ideally"" it should be effective from the child's birth date.  
Should we work with UHC here to get this sorted?  
Or  
Work with the hospital/Clinics & request them to bill past visits for Baby to Dad's Insurance (if retroactive billing is even a thing here)

* On the Husband's side, we are clear. He needs to open a Traditional IRA --&gt; Contribute 6k --&gt; Keep it in cash --&gt; Convert to ROTH IRA the next day. There is no pro-rata rule for him
* Should we do this anytime in 2022? or should we do this in the first week of Jan 2023 for 2022?

* On the Wife's side, we will have to go thru pro-rata conversion.
   * **Option 1:** Should we convert the current 11k --&gt; Roth IRA and then do a separate 6k for 2022 --&gt;. Roth IRA?
   * **Option 2:** or should we contribute 6k first and then convert the 17k in one go?

I'm 26, making about 75k/year gross income.

I currently have been living in an 850-900 sq ft. rental home I've been in for about 3 years.  I've been at my current job for about 5 years with no hope of getting out to another location for 4-5 years most likely. I was very fortunate to find this small house, albeit pretty crappy, for $575/mo and they haven't raised the rent on me since I've been here.  It's also pretty risky I suppose, but after the first year lease, we've been on a non-written agreement to do month-to-month since then with nothing actually signed.

Recently about 1.5-2 years ago I decided to get serious with retirement investments early for the future because I saw that my parents (separated) are struggling with nearly no retirement each, and I don't want that, I want to retire early (My dream is 47-50, I'm eligible at 47).  So I raised the 5% to 10%, then quickly to 15% (this was all roth TSP) and seeing it was a lot out of my paycheck for me.  Then after discussion and realizing I could max traditional TSP without as much of a cut to my take-home since it's pre-tax, I later quickly started maxing that out about last year.  I also finally learned about ROTH IRA and started one of those about 2-3 years ago (2023 is my third year maxing roth ira).  **So about 38% of gross income is invested in TSP (govt 401k) and Roth IRA, both S&amp;P 500 style funds.**

I've become addicted with saving towards retirement and I'm seeing the number grow more and more.  I try to follow the rule of having 1x annual earnings ($75k) saved by 30 years old, and according to Fidelity, between the two retirement accounts, some crypto (I know longer invest in but im holding), and individual stocks (no longer invest, but holding), and Checking Account balances, I am at $75,367 as of writing this at 26 years old.  It feels like a huge achievement and I can't wait to hit my first $100k!

Since I'll most likely be staying here in the town I live in for my job (not easy to transfer at all), I'd like some more living space as I've only stayed here (850-900 sq ft.) because it's cheap rent compared to similar for $1200-$1500/month rent.  My younger brother (21) whom has never left home to live on his own and wants a change of lifestyle has mentioned coming to live with me (states away from home).  This would also be the reason for more space, and as someone who is single for a while now and missing home, it would be nice to roommate with my younger brother who I share a very similar personality with.  I would probably charge him like $200 for a room per month if that.  It feels weird to charge my brother.  Not sure if I should expect more or none at all from him (open to advice on that).

I also don't want to be reliant on a roommate's rent payment to afford mortgage.

&amp;#x200B;

I have researched a lot, including Reddit, and understand that I should probably just leave the investments in TSP and IRA sit and don't withdraw!  **My main concern is, should I contribute LESS to those to have more money for a house mortgage** that can provide more living space, nicer place that isn't old and wearing down (I didn't mention but the hot summers are cooled by window units and winters warmed by one big heater vent in the living room that struggles to circulate to the rest of house.  I would love central cooling and heat), and starting to invest my monthly rent towards my own property instead of someone else's pockets.  I understand that rent is a necessary expense on it's own so it shouldn't be frowned upon; that's why I've stayed renting for so long, but I think I'm wanting to make that jump.

The only concern is after I've finally been able to achieve maxing TSP and IRA (this year would be the first year  both are 100% maxed), it's hard to think about contributing less so I can afford a mortgage in this insane 6+% loan interest market with expensive houses (around here the good ones are $150k+).  I would love a nice kitchen, big living room,  central air, and a backyard (I have none of this), but I also don't like to jump into big purchases since my only debt currently is $4k in student loans that  may be forgiven from the President.  My 2017 car has been paid off and I like to make extra payments on debt (factoring that into mortgage, I don't want nothing leftover each month, I'd like to make extra payments.

I was told to buy before Covid happened in 2019 and I didn't listen, and the market went up.  I don't want to wait around forever hoping rates will decrease only to see them go up more.  I'm not sure if it applies to homes, but I understand time in market is better than timing it, so I think I want in.

I can't afford a very big down payment (maybe $4k-$6k after tax refund) so I might be looking at an FHA loan whatever that would mean. I don't even know what I can afford.

114taqd,BMXBikr,"26yo. Do I keep contributing max TSP and Roth IRA and save minimally for a home down payment, or contribute only 5% match to TSP, none to IRA, and save max amount possible for home?

Main goal is early retirement

I want a home and to stop renting soon, but I've saved nothing liquid in my bank account for a down payment (only about $5k emergency).  I've been investing as much as possible in TSP and Roth IRA for 2 years, just now starting max contributions this year.  

I've been told since I'm 26, these are very important early years to get money in TSP and IRA now for compounding earnings for an early retirement (50yo if not earlier).  I'm nervous to cut back on contributions, but I could save a 20% down payment for a 200k home in about 1.5 years (doing 5% tsp match only) vs. 4-5 years if I keep maxing out both tsp and ira.

11qxz9p,BMXBikr,"Should I invest extra in FXAIX, VOO, or Individual Stocks for my situation?

I max out Traditional TSP (80% C &amp; 20% S)and Roth IRA (all FXAIX).  HSA would be my next option, but where I live, the HDHP is not accepted anywhere within 4 hours of driving.  Where should I invest extra? 

I recently read that FXAIX as a mutual fund is good for retirement fund like my IRA so I'm glad I'm already doing that, but I'm also reading that VOO index fund is better for a standalone brokerage account for tax savings.  How much of a difference actually is this at the end of 25-30 years? I'd prefer to keep my investments in one place (fidelity) if possible, but if it's a no brainer to open a Vanguard account for VOO because it's ""better"" I will.    
Or should I just invest extra in stocks like AAPL which over 5 years has done over 40% annually? I have definitely done a lot better just letting money sit and trusting it'll increase over time in TSP and IRA.  I feel like I could now do that with individual stocks now that I have some experience (early on I tried individual right away and bought high and sold low before I started learning more about investing for retirement).  Individual stocks like AAPL seems like a no-brainer at those returns, but I also like the idea of set it and forget it until I'm ready to retire.

**TSP: $69,400**

2. **$2,384.38** @ 4.290% interest (36.04 monthly)

I pulled the average of 4 paychecks without overtime and I average $1500/2weeks (**$3000/month**), but I still have  my monthly income in my budget spreadsheet as $2500.

**Monthly** **Expenses/Budget** that are subtracted from the monthly $2500 (but my calculations show $500 more as seen above):

* Rent - $575 (was just informed this is going up to **$650** in October)

* Car Insurance -  $107
* Spotify Family - $17
* Cell Phone - $42
* Fuel for Car - $60 (I don't take too many trips, mostly just my 15min commute to work, and back)
* Food - $200 (I budget this much, and try to eat cheap (chicken nugs, rice, toast/eggs, noodles, spaghetti, etc. but order take out maybe twice a week)

Now, my goal for the last 4 years has been early retirement (I can retire with pension at earliest 47yo, but TSP, IRA, and Social Security probably has to come later, not sure if I can collect earlier, but I'm still figuring out/learning how that all works.

I would probably be fine, if I went back down to just 5-10% TSP contributions with no IRA contributions, but I want to do whatever is best long term.

I also have been trying to save hard for a down payment to start paying on a house, and I waited when the interest waits were 2-3%, then I waited when they were 5%, and now they're 6-7% so I'm starting to worry, but I also know I am fortunate to have a really low rent, but I'm getting sick of the tiny place I'm in with no back yard, full dirt front yard (desert area).  

&#x200B;

I also like having no debt basically and know student loan payments are coming back.  

I'm stuck between:

1. Buy cheaper house $140k-180k that needs fixing (I'm not savvy with DIY, so fixing would cost me), and keep maxing retirement accounts
2. Buy more expensive $200k-$250k house that is mostly move-in ready, but might have to shorten retirement contributions a bit, but hope that the house investment will make up for the loss in retirement contributions. 
3. Keep renting at $650 and save for higher down-payment at risk of housing prices/interest rates increasing anyway, and possibly getting REALLY tired of this small place (Again, I'm grateful for the low rent compared to most, but its small sq ft and pretty crappy house in dangerous area, also I don't have central air, i have 2 window units that don't cool the whole house and sometimes trip the breaker.  Central air would be a dream come true). 

\*And then I don't know if I should just pay off my student loans with or without buying a  house, or ride that wave of monthly payments hoping for some kind of forgiveness. 

\*I've also considered renting out a room if I get one of the bigger houses.  I think a roommate could be fun, but I've never dealt with it before.

If I'm retired, wouldn't my taxable income be $0?!

Single. I make $66,000/year gross. I just got promoted to about $70k-72k.  With my govt. Job I also expect yearly raises until I reach top of my payband around $90k.  My insurance and 401K is taken out of paycheck before expenses listed below. My 401k(actually TSP) is 15% or currently before the wage increase, about $390 each biweekly check, or $780/month. My monthly net after taxes, 401k, insurance is about $2800-3000 (paid more on nights and Sundays to get to $3000). Here are roughly my current expenses: 

Rent: $575 (got a tad lucky with this rent but the house is really small and run down, depressing, but cheap. With current prices, rent everywhere else is easily $1000+. Landlord hasn't raised price since I started 2 years ago, but also not on lease anymore, I just keep paying monthly and they keep letting me live here.)

Hulu: $8

Student loans: $73 (about $3000 remaining) (also not paying during the pause from the president)

So maybe $842 leftover?


I want to move because this place even for 1 feels cramped and depressing, the neighbor dogs all around bark all night and neighbors won't listen to me to take them inside, but that's a different matter.

I WANT to move to a bit bigger place and have it be my own, but I also have gotten into a really good retirement savings kick 2 years ago after learning about saving early (schools should really do better with teaching this young. My coworker taught me and opened my eyes to how much I could have in the future. So I went from 5% 401k to %15 and maxing Roth IRA.)

I don't want a fixer upper, I'd prefer move in and ready to live with barely any fixings right away if at all. 
Most houses for this are $200k-$275k in my area. $100k-$165k are mostly way outdated, need work, or crack house but has much sq. footage.

I very much want to retire early so I know saving is important, but I also know houses can be good for equity and earning money over time as well.

I don't have much for a down payment (maybe $4-5k) currently because I throw a lot into retirement (I think it's a lot, it feels like it to me) unless I take from my IRA contributions or 401k/tsp loan which I heard you shouldn't do. So I'd probably have to do FHA Loan (would be my first house). 

What can I afford if I keep contributing to retirement? 

Should I back off retirement a bit to afford more monthly mortgage? 

Should I suck it up and stay in this crap house because it's cheap rent and keep adding to retirement? (I know rent can be looked at as an expense and not throwing money away, but still), and saving for more down payment?

I want money leftover for the random splurge and what not too. I buy a lot of clothes at thrift store and I'm set for a while there. I only buy family gifts for bdays, I don't do Christmas gifts anymore to save money, and if we do it's one gift secret Santa. Idk else what expenses are needed.

I said hell no to buying about 3 years ago at beginning of my career because I made about half what I make now, but I think my coworker was right in that it was a good time to buy. Now I'm wanting to buy and it feels like a crappy time to buy that might get worse. Knowing my luck I'll buy and in one year the house will be worth way less from adjusting to the market. 

I really don't want to move rentals just to have my rent increase by double, then it will feel like I'm throwing it away. I'd rather spend double what I pay now towards equity.

Why not just lose the Roth and go as much as possible in TSP?


If I just lose the Roth and just go full TSP with that money, wouldn't the outcome years later be roughly the same? Ex. Instead of $200k (Roth) + 400k (TSP), wouldn't I have roughly just $600k TSP since the funds are nearly identical? I don't understand percentages so would I grow more money with that 10% yearly in one account with a bigger total of money or does it grow the same in two separate accounts?

I'm debating switching to a 2 car setup. Getting a ~$5-8k used commuter car for my weekly stuff that gets much better mileage, and a $3-5k junker small truck(think 1990's small pickup. Ford ranger, Mazda truck, etc) for my material hauling. The thought being it's less total cost, and the redundancy of having 2 vehicles makes up for the reliability drop of having older cars. 

Does anyone have experience to share one way or the other? Reasons I shouldn't go the two-car route?",Yes,Yes,No,No,No
18ike0k,bobombpom,"My job has a crazy 401k program. Do I still need to save for retirement outside of it?

I'm a ~30 year old professional. I like my job, and don't see myself retiring before 59. I also don't really have a desire to be a ""Whale"" in retirement. Just need enough to stay housed, fed, and have some hobbies. 

Gross income is currently ~$110k. I  spend ~$50k/yr on all of my expenses combined(60% needs, 40% wants). I include my Mortgage as a need, and my car payment as a want.

My job has a 100% match on the first 6% of contributions, and my 6.5% annual bonus goes directly into my 401k. I opt for the Roth contribution option, so when I put in 6%, effectively 20% of my gross income is saved for retirement. 

I've been running projections with my current account balances(assuming 6% real returns, tax rates stay the same at retirement). With JUST those contributions, I'll have $2mm of after-tax, today's dollars money at 59 years old. Or $80k/yr at 4% withdrawal rate. A 60% pay-bump from my current lifestyle.

If JUST my 401k is enough to cover my lifestyle goals, is it silly that I'm also maxing a Roth IRA, HSA, and putting money into a brokerage account every month? With my retirement goals outlined above, does it make more sense to spend that money now?

That extra savings takes me from $80k retirement income to $115k. I don't think that would make a significant difference to the lifestyle I want at retirement.

Going from $50k to $65k spending now could make a significant difference to my quality of life for the next 30 years.",Yes,Yes,No,No,No
rxnz6o,bobombpom,"I'm in a favorable negotiating position for the first time in my life. How do I come out on top?

I'm in a position that is OK, making about $80k/yr. I'm currently interviewing with another company in a sister industry for a position that is very similar, but slightly more aligned with what I want to do long-term.

I interviewed with the second company for a position I wasn't qualified for, and was very up-front with what my capabilities are and why I think I could still handle that job. They liked me so much that they are creating a lower-credential-required job for me. Now I'm scheduled for an on-site interview, and they straight up told me that if I had a couple more years of experience they would have offered me the other position.

So now I'm in a really strong negotiating position, and I've never had to navigate that before. I like my current job enough to stay if this new one doesn't work out. I have the skill set and attitude they want. How do I navigate this to get the most for myself?",Yes,Yes,No,No,No

oc9hie,brethart91,"What should I do with my existing 401k given my situation?

Hi, I'm wondering if someone with experience can offer guidance an on what to do in my financial situation.

I'm in the process of changing jobs, and I'm not sure what to do with my existing 401k. I know there's a section in the wiki about my options (leave it where it is, roll it into an IRA, and roll it into my new 401k plan), but being an amateur at this, I'm still not sure what to do in my specific situation. Here are the details:

\-I'm 35.  
\-I have a 401k at my current employer with about $160k in it.  
\-I have a Traditional IRA (a rollover from a 401k at a previous employer) that has about $25k in it. Also, I honestly haven't looked too closely at this and instead have let my financial advisor handle my IRAs--but I believe the main fund is VSTAX.  
\-I have a Roth IRA that I started a while back with about $15k in it.  
\-I have a couple of 529s for my kids with about $10k in them.  
\-No debt except my house.  
\-Monthly expenses of about $2,000.  
\-I have an emergency fund of six months' worth of expenses.

In my new situation:

\-Gross income of about $100k.  
\-Combined with my wife we are in the 22% tax bracket.  
\-New employer matches 100% of contributions up to 3% of salary.  
\-New 401k can be Traditional or IRA. I'm still not sure if it's an either/or kind of thing or if I can do both simultaneously.  
\-New 401k allows for roll ins from other 401ks.

I know fund offerings and expense ratios come into play, and I'm sure there's a way that benefits my financial advisor the most if it goes to an IRA. I understand he needs to get paid too, but I also want to protect my interests. For example, I wouldn't want to move $160k and based on the fees structure, he automatically get 10% or something right off the bat--that would seem foolish of me...

What would you do with the existing 401k if you were in my situation?

Also, if you happen to have any thoughts going forward about whether to contribute to a Traditional or Roth 401k, I would be interested to hear that too.

Thanks so much!",Yes,Yes,No,Yes,No
oe8i7x,brethart91,"How can I separate from my financial advisor?

Sorry if this sounds like a dumb question, but I have a financial advisor that Iâ€™ve used for over a decade, and the more I read and understand about investment strategies, the more I think I can do what theyâ€™re doing myself and not pay a 1% feeâ€¦

I have a Traditional and Roth IRA and two 529s with their firmâ€¦.so how does one go about essentially having the same accounts with the same funds (presumably) but not have it be managed by the financial advisor (and therefore not pay fees)?

ALSO, Iâ€™m starting a new job soon so my existing 401k needs to go somewhere, so any high-level instructions on how to move that myself would be helpful. Do I just go to a place like Fidelity, open a(nother) Traditional IRA with VSTAX like my other IRA, and just roll it in?

Can anyone offer some guidance (and maybe some reassurance) that this is a good idea?

Btw, I know I havenâ€™t given a ton of details but essentially Iâ€™m planning on maxing out my new 401k and then my Roth IRA, and periodically contributing to my 529s for the foreseeable future. So nothing too crazy right now.

oeu2rt,brethart91,"Traditional or Roth 401k in my specific situation?

Hi, I know this Traditional vs. Roth 401k (or IRA) discussion has been brought up a million times (so much so there's a section in the wiki about it:

[https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/wiki/rothortraditional](https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/wiki/rothortraditional)

However, as much as I research this topic and read the wiki, I still am unsure what makes sense to do. So I'm asking point blank--which would you do?

\- I'm 35. I file taxes jointly with my wife.  
\- We have a combined income of around $185k.  
\- We currently make contributions to our traditional retirement accounts (so pre-tax), but I'm starting  a new job that offers both Traditional and Roth 401ks which is why I'm asking this.  
\-We qualify for tax deductions/credits that I won't qualify for in retirement. Specifically, child tax credit and mortgage interest deduction.  
\-We're planning on maxing out our 401k/403bs regardless of the type  
\-We're planning on maxing out our HSA  
\-We're planning on maxing out our IRAs  
\-No debt besides mortgage, and we have 6 months' worth of expenses in an emergency fund if we need it.  


So here I am--what feels like right in the middle of everything, where I don't have an astronomical income nor do I have a very low income that would make the decision easier. I meet some of the criteria that would lean towards a Roth 401k but not all of it. Yes, like many people, I would like to retire early--maybe around age 50 if that's possible--so I've also read up on the Roth IRA ladder--so I'm not sure if that plays into this.

Just a few more notes:

\-I'm planning to roll my existing plan into a Traditional IRA and let it sit (this decent-sized balance maybe can serve as the source for the Roth conversion ladder?)

\-As I mentioned, I'm planning to max out either the Traditional or Roth 401k at my new employer, followed by the HSA, followed by our Roth IRAs that we currently have. After that, I think we're looking at taxable brokerage accounts..

So given the various deductions I have/will have, does the Traditional or Roth 401k make more sense?

And is my strategy for contributing to all of these accounts sound? Or would you change something about it? I'm hoping someone with knowledge of this or similar experience can offer some guidance!

Thank you in advance!",Yes,Yes,No,Yes,No
of9r19,brethart91,"Job Change and New Dependent Care FSA Limit

I am in the midst of changing jobs, and I currently have a Dependent Care FSA through my employer that Iâ€™ve signed up to contribute the max ($5k) too. That means, at this point in the year, Iâ€™ve contributed and claimed about half of it.

I know after I leave I have three months to submit any receipts to get the remaining balance back. For simplicity letâ€™s say Iâ€™ve contributed and claimed $2,500.

oizxjs,brethart91,"Does my retirement strategy make sense, or should I change something?

Hi All,

If you get a minute, would you mind looking at my retirement strategy below to see if it makes sense? My goal is to retire in about 15 years at age 50. I've gathered several pieces of advice and tried to bring it all together for my situation, so any advice or changes you could give me would be greatly appreciated.

&amp;#x200B;

**General Information:**

Age: 35

Target Retirement Age: 50

Combined AGI: $185,000

Tax Bracket: 24% (Married Filing Jointly)

Joint yearly expenses in retirement: $80k (or $40k/person)

&amp;#x200B;

**Current Accounts:**

401k: $160k

Traditional IRA (rollover from a past employer's 401k): $25k

Roth IRA: $15k

HSA: negligible amount

&amp;#x200B;

**My Proposed Strategy:**

&amp;#x200B;

***1) Right now: Starting a new job.***

\- I'm planning to choose use a Traditional 401k at my new job (they offer Roth and Traditional).

\- I'm planning to roll in both my current 401k and my Traditional IRA to my new 401k (assuming a good fund selection).

That'll leave me with one 401k (balance: $185k) and one Roth IRA (balance: $15k). No Traditional IRA (to pave the way for a backdoor Roth if I need it).

If I can, I'm planning to use a Target Date Fund for the Traditional 401k and Roth IRA. Something like FIHFX from Fidelity.

***2) Next Fifteen Years: Age 35-50.***

\- I'm planning to max out my Traditional 401k ($19,500), my Roth IRA ($6,000), and HSA ($7,200) each year for as long as my income will allow me.

\- After maxing those three accounts, invest any extra funds in children's 529s and a Taxable Brokerage account.

\- If/when our MAGI exceeds $208k, then open a Traditional IRA and leverage a backdoor Roth strategy (or mega backdoor Roth if my 401k plan allows for in-service distribution to a Roth IRA). Continue to do this instead of a Taxable Brokerage Account because it's tax advantaged and there's no limit(?).

***3a) Retirement (phase 1): Age 50-55.***

\- I'm planning to stop working at 50 and live off of $40k / year ($80k between the two of us) from my Taxable Brokerage Account and/or Roth IRA for 5 years.

\- At the same time, convert $40k / year from my Traditional 401k / IRA (if I rolled it into one) into my Roth IRA and let it season for 5 years (Roth IRA ladder), since my marginal tax bracket should be low.

**3b) Retirement (phase 2): Age 55-60.**

\- I'm planning to start living primarily off of my Roth IRA conversions from the Roth IRA ladder and maybe supplement with the Taxable Brokerage account if necessary.

***3c) Retirement (phase 3): Age 60+.***

\- I'm planning to take distributions from my Traditional 401k / IRA (using the 4% rule) and maybe supplement with Roth IRA, Taxable Brokerage account, and HSA (at age 65), as long as I stay in a low tax bracket.

&amp;#x200B;

**Other notes (not sure if these affect anything):**

\- I have two children, so we're leveraging 529s, a Dependent Care FSA / Child Care Tax Credit, Child Tax Credit.

\- Only debt is the house, which I'm planning to have paid off in the next 8 or so years...

I want to know if this seems rational and makes sense as a strategy as I progress through my career...Are there any holes you can poke in, or is it a fairly solid strategy?

Hi. At my current employer, I elected $5,000 (the maximum at the time) for Dependent Care FSA (DCFSA). It equates to a little over $400 / month that I contribute. However, my daycare expenses accrue at more than 2x that rate...but for simplicity, let's say it's 2x, or $800 / month.

So it's like this:

Jan 21 Daycare: $800, DCFSA: $400

Feb 21 Daycare: $1600, DCFSA: $800

So in March, I submitted a claim for January because that's when I had enough money in my DCFSA to cover a month's worth of daycare (January's).

So I'm always having to wait longer to submit receipts...

Right now, I'm in the process of switching jobs, and that caused me to have two questions:

1) Since I've only contributed a little over half of the $5,000 (around $2,800), at my new employer, can I elect the remaining $2,200? Is that how it works?

1a) Depending on the answer to #1, if the new employer supports the new limit of $10,500 for DCFSA, can I elect what would now be $8,300?

1b) Let's say they don't support the new limit of $10,500 and it's still $5,000....can I elect the full $5,000 again, knowing the total from my last employer and my new employer this year would add up to $7,800 ($2,800 + $5,000)?

&amp;#x200B;

2) Once I'm done with my current employer, I'll need to submit a claim to get the remaining balance in my account...but to do that, I'll only need to get a receipt for services rendered March-April. Will I be able to file a claim with my new DCFSA manager to recoup expenses from May-present (and the rest of the year) or would they only take receipts for expenses incurred while my new DCFSA is active (So July forward)? If it's the latter, then I have no way of claiming expenses from May- mid-July...

Can someone with experience answer some of these questions?

omv5ei,brethart91,"How to ask if my 401k plan supports a Mega Backdoor Roth?

I'm about to start a new job soon and my new employer offers both Traditional and Roth 401k plans. I'm planning to go the Traditional 401k route.

I'll be talking to plan administrator soon, and I'm planning to see if the Traditional 401k plan supports:

1) My rolling in my 401k from my most recent employer and my Rollover (Traditional) IRA from a 401k at a previous employer...

2) Mega Backdoor Roths

I feel like I can ask the first question clearly so that I can get a definitive answer. However, what's the best way to ask the second question?

Is it like this:

""Does the Traditional 401k plan you offer allow for after-tax contributions and in-service distributions to a Roth IRA?""

onph1w,brethart91,"Can I have two health insurances?

My entire family is covered by my wifeâ€™s high deductible health plan (which is actually a pretty good plan). She/we also have an HSA attached to it that I believe we contribute something like $2k / year to.

I was looking at the health plans at my new employer and while theyâ€™re not as good of plans as my wifeâ€™s, the company will pay 100% for single HDHP coverage. So I have a few questions. We are in the US.

1) Can I have two health insurances at once? Primary coverage through my wifeâ€™s family HDHP and single coverage through my employer?

2) Part of the reason I want HDHP at my new employer is because they will contribute some (not much) but some money to an HSA automatically if Iâ€™m on an HDHPâ€¦.and if single coverage wouldnâ€™t cost me anything, that sounds like free moneyâ€¦also, Iâ€™m not sure if both my wife and I can have an HSA concurrentlyâ€¦.?

3) Not really a question but there are other perks like a gym membership etc that come with all health plans so thatâ€™s another reason why Iâ€™m interested to see if I can just elect this single coverage but never really use it as my primary insurance. Which brings me to my next question of:

4) If I am able to get coverage at my employer and both my wife and my plan is an 80%/20% split, can I run a bill (letâ€™s say itâ€™s $100) through my wifeâ€™s (primary) insurance, which would mean I would owe $20, then run it through my insurance, which would mean I owe $4 ($20 x 0.20)?

oo12b4,brethart91,"How to max out my 401k with a mid-year job change?

Ok, this is a very dumb question, but I just need validation that I'm thinking about this the right way. I recently switched jobs and I want to max out my 401k for the year. While these aren't exact numbers, they are simple enough for me to illustrate my point. Let's say I contributed $1,000 at my last employer and I make $100,000 at my new employer...

When I go to elect benefits, would I calculate the % for 2021 as follows?

$19,500 (max 401k contribution for 2021)

\- $1,000 (what I've already contributed for the year)

= $18,500

Let's say any benefits I elect this month don't go into effect until the first week of next month (week 31 of the year). I believe would be 22 remaining weeks of the year at that time.

so then $100,000 / 52 = $1,923 per week.

$1,923  x 22 = $42,306 remaining gross earnings for the year once the benefits are active...

\--------

$18,500 / $42,306 = 43.7% the percentage I would use now to ensure I max out my 401k for 2021.

Then, when it's open enrollment time (or maybe just prior to the first of the year?) change the percentage to 19.5% because I would have a full year ahead of me.

I really wish I could just put in a flat dollar amount. I suppose it's possible, but I haven't seen the screens yet to know...

Anyway, does my calculation and plan sound correct, or am I missing something?

I have a few questions regarding HSA accounts that I'm hoping someone can help me get answers to.

I am planning to enroll in a HDHP and HSA at my new employer. My entire family (including me) is covered under my wife's insurance. That's our primary insurance. So this new insurance would be considered my secondary, I suppose. I have a few questions about this situation.

1) If my wife and I both have HSAs that we contribute to, but my primary insurance is through my wife, can I use MY HSA account to pay for medical expenses that haven't been run through my insurance (i.e., they would've been run through my wife's--our primary)? Is it just considered a regular account and it doesn't matter whose plan it's ""attached"" to?

2) If my new employer contributes to my HSA as a perk of sorts, does that contribution count toward the annual family max of $7,200, or is it only the combination of my and my wife's contributions that count toward the limit?

3) I believe HSA contributions can be changed at any time, correct? So if I decide to contribute $1,000 initially but want to change it to $1,500 a month from now, I should be able to do that, correct?

4) Besides HSAs and Dependent Care FSAs, are there any other common ""individual"" accounts whose limits are based on the household or family? I'm trying to make sure I know specifically which accounts I need to coordinate with my wife on during open enrollment so we don't exceed any limits.

oprxyo,brethart91,"Is this a valid HSA scenario?

Hi, Iâ€™m covered under my wifeâ€™s health insurance. She has a Family HDHP and contributes $1,000 to her HSA.

My new employer will cover the premium for single coverage of an HDHP and also contribute to an HSA for me. I want to elect that coverage because it would allow me to get a partially funded HSA + some other perks.

My question is, letâ€™s say I do that and have dual health coverage for the rest of 2021â€¦then I choose not to elect benefits through my employer for 2022â€¦.

1) What happens to my HSA in 2022? I believe it just sits there if I drop my HDHP, correct?

2) If I did drop my HDHP, I would still be covered under my wifeâ€™s HDHP, so does that meet enough of a requirement that I could still contribute pretax money through my paycheck to my HSA at my employer (despite no longer having their HDHP)?

I hope I explained that well enough. I know itâ€™s a bit of an odd situation but Iâ€™m wondering if itâ€™s technically possible since I would have an HDHP that Iâ€™m covered under and be trying to contribute to an HSA (which sounds normal but in this situation my HSA and HDHP coverage exist in separate places/companies).

oscu86,brethart91,"HSA limit on an individual HDHP plan when spouse has family coverage

If my wife has family HDHP coverage and I have individual HDHP coverage, can I contribute the full $7,200 limit to my HSA and she contribute $0 to hers, despite her being the one with the family coverage? I think we'd both be eligible and the combined amount wouldn't exceed the family limit.

The reason I ask is because my new employer has separate areas for selecting HDHP coverage and HSA account type. In the HSA area, I need to choose ""Individual"" or ""Family"". I know HSAs are only individual, but I think it's so that they can validate the contribution amount I put in the field and error if goes over the max ($3,600 individual, $7,200 family).

So if the answer to my question is ""Yes"" and I can contribute the entire $7,200 despite my having just an individual HDHP plan, then that means I'll have to select the ""Family"" HSA option, which I'm sure would cause some issue (my employer I think would just see a mismatch of an individual HDHP with a family(limit) HSA.

So do I choose ""Family"", have a mismatch between HDHP and HSA types, put in $7,200 and hope for the best or do I choose ""Individual"", put in $3,600 and then explain to HR that my spouse has family coverage so I'm eligible to contribute $7,200 and see if they can adjust it.

Again, this is all assuming that I am, in fact, eligible for the family limit in my HSA account.

osumuz,brethart91,"Conversion IRA Transfer Question

Many years ago, I had a Traditional 401k with an employer. When I left that company, I transferred those funds into a Rollover IRA (I think also called Conduit IRA) with American Funds. A few years ago, my financial advisor suggested I move it to another financial institution where some of my other accounts (like my Roth IRA) were, which we did.

I've not contributed anything to it since it's been a Rollover IRA either at American Funds or where it is now in case that matters here (how could I anyway? It's pretax money...)

My question is, is it possible that it lost its Rollover/Conduit designation when it was transferred from American Funds to this other institution? I'm concerned that it went from a Rollover (Traditional) to a Traditional without the Rollover distinction. The reason I ask is because I think my new 401k plan accepts roll ins, but only from pre-tax IRAs that were from qualified retirement plans--which I think means Rollover IRAs...

Forgive my ignorance, but can someone tell me, if I have Fund A and Fund B, how can I compare them apples to apples?

Is it that Fund B is a better investment because 9.5% - 0.015% = 9.485%  is a higher net return vs Fund A (which had a higher gross return, but also a higher expense ratio). 10% - 0.75% = 9.25%?

My new 401k is managed by Fidelity, and they said I would need to personally get a distribution check from the originating institution and then turn around and deposit it with Fidelity within 60 days.

Hi, I have a 401k that's managed by institution ""B"". It accepts roll-ins from qualified accounts/plans.

My intention is to:

1) Roll the funds from the Rollover IRA at ""A"" into my new 401k at ""B""  
2) Transfer my Roth IRA at ""A"" to a Roth IRA at ""B""

This way, all of my accounts are with institution ""B""

I am trying to work with institution ""A"" to cut a check (FBO my name) so that I can hand it over to institution ""B"" to complete the roll in (this is how it has to happen to go from IRA to 401k). However, they are giving me lots of reasons why they can't issue me the check or why it's a huge to-do.

Rather than trying to work through that headache (for me), I am thinking of just doing an in-kind transfer of my Rollover IRA from ""A"" to ""B"" first (like I am with my Roth), THEN when everything is under the umbrella of institution ""B"", roll the Traditional IRA funds to 401k and close the traditional IRA account.

The difference is that the transfer of IRA to IRA first won't require me to make any more phone calls or get a check. I would just initiate the transfer online and Institution ""B"" would somehow facilitate the transfer. At least that gets the money out of institution ""A""

However, I think that uses up my twelve-month quota of IRA to IRA transfers, correct? If so, would doing that then prevent me from transferring my Roth IRA, or is it once every twelve months per IRA type?

My employer contributes an amount each paycheck to my HSA. I know employer contributions count toward the max, so I have my contributions set accordingly so that Iâ€™ll have contributed the max amount by the end of the year.

Due to a miscommunication, theyâ€™ve actually been contributing more than they shouldâ€™ve (my contributions are based on this higher amountâ€”so together itâ€™s not over the max).

To correct this, they said they would simply contact Fidelity to reverse the overage theyâ€™ve contributed, but:

1) I have all of my HSA money invested, and Fidelity apparently told them they canâ€™t reverse the overageâ€”I think until I sell some of my (one) fundâ€”and get that amount they plan to reverse in the Cash account.

Thatâ€™s fineâ€”I donâ€™t see why I shouldnâ€™t be able to do that, except

2) Theyâ€™re looking to reverse the exact amount of overage theyâ€™ve contributed. Does that seem correct? For several months that money has been invested and earning/losing money. Wouldnâ€™t that also need to be considered in the reversal?

3) Once this is all settled, I plan to adjust (increase) my contributions to make up the difference so that I still contribute the max.

So I am disabled - have been since I was born. Currently, my parents are looking into ABLE Act accounts (I am 99% sure I told them about it when it was signed into law - but I guess they forgot to set one up?) and they asked me to look into it today.



I am seeing that Fidelity allows ABLE Act accounts to be set up regardless of state (The Fidelity account is based in MA). It also allows you to invest the funds in the account - if I were to set it up, I imagine my parents would be able to put in around ~3-5k to start it up, then kick around that every year for a few more years.


So, if they were to set this up sometime soon, how much would you recommend be kept in cash and how much invested? I was thinking their 50, 60, 70, or 85% portfolio while my parents are still here (then switch it to a 20 or 30%) - I live in a HCOL state (NJ) - with property taxes around 7000 a year (That is where the property taxes should be frozen under NJ's senior freeze program).


They are also thinking of setting up a special needs trust for life insurance and other monies (pension) to go to (Would this be a good idea?). They aren't planning on anything happening to them soon, but their financial advisor has been trying to convince them to go to someone to get one set up for a few years now and they are finally listening, since we've been researching the Disabled Adult Children regulations.

My situation: I'm 31, parents are 67 and 57, my dad is going to start collecting SSI for old age in 1-2 years (so I can start medicare before my mom retires), and they are planning on being around for a while - the house is paid off, so when they go, I will only have to pay homeowners and property taxes (homeowners is usually around 1.5k a year, property taxes around 6.5k). I may also be able to try to work, however, it is best to do so *after* my dad retires and I have this account set up because of how the regulations are set up. 


Barring anything catastrophic, I should be around for at least another 30 years (if not more). I currently do not have a spouse or any dependents. I would be able to contribute around ~150 a month to the account, and my parents would put in around 2-3k a year.

I do not need the money for a while (hopefully). I do not know if I will be able to work for a while (or ever), so this may constitute a good chunk of my money once my parents die (and when that happens I should receive around $3000 a month in SSI). I might be able to put around $100-$200 a month into the account (may increase after I see how much I get after the COLA)


Note: I know that yes, my parents should see a special needs lawyer and a financial advisor, but they'll ""get around to it"" - which means it probably won't happen. Their advisor's a Wells Fargo guy who isn't a fiduciary, and they refuse to see a fiduciary, so yeah. They only have around ~400k in 401k/IRA retirement and they are both retiring in 2026. One parent is going to try to earn some money in retirement through a small home baking business and who knows what the other parent will do. When my parents are retired, they will no longer have life insurance (They didn't plan for this even though I have been disabled my entire life)

Food and Gym Stack 62 hours 
$1326 bi
$2652 monthly 

Solo Food 50 hours a week

$2408 monthly

I just paid $1500 for a nice place in Carlsbad California. And itâ€™s only $1000 with a peaceful older couple in their 50s. 

My next step is handling a car. 

My current schedule is I have work 8 am to 1 pm. Then 1 pm to 10 pm at my full time job. 

First job - a- sales 
Currently working a job at 40 hours for $14/hr in entry level. Thereâ€™s room for growth because everyone is getting each other fired. But thatâ€™s up in the air. 

Second job - b - restaurant 
My other job is guaranting me 50 hours at $16 an hour and 10 hours of overtime at $24 an hour. They are also offering me an assistant manager position. 
I work at two stores for the same company. 
The restaurant is very disorganized and stressful. Indeed ranked it 1. At one point one of the male general managers was man handling me because he found out I wanted to work at the main store. 

At my main store I got into a relationship with one of the cashier. For less than a week before I woke up and broke it off. Sheâ€™s holding it against me and she has her friends on two occasions text and harass me.  

So I might even lose the parks of the restaurant job. 

The gym is also very dramatic. 

Right now should I keep both? Half ? Or take advantage of the restaurant overtime ?

Currently $3000 cash on hand. 

I get paid roughly $2000 after taxes every 2 weeks if I make sales. I work 2 jobs at 61 hours a week. My rent is roughly $1100 with utilities. Not counting food expenses which I work at a restaurant which I could save money. 

My first job is 2 miles from my house that I get to at 8 am to 12 pm. Restaurant. 

Then I leave at 12 pm for my second job that starts at 1 pm at 4.5 miles away that ends at 10 pm. Sales gym job. 

So this is ideal because my house room rental is 7.5 miles away from my second job. 

The issue is that if I return the scooter now itâ€™s going to cost me about $60 in Uber rides each day. Thereâ€™s no metro bus transit after 10 pm. In between the 12 pm and 1 pm thereâ€™s no bus that takes 2 hours to get to the gym job. 

One of the jobs have to be put on hold or I would need to Uber to upkeep both jobs. If I Uber thatâ€™s $60 hours of wage lost about 6 hours of work. So why work 2 jobs when my hours at the job is lost. 

So the solution is the following. 

1. get a used car under $3000 or $5,000 next month - I donâ€™t know how to maintain or fix car. If I spend it here thereâ€™s no guarantee over the Craigslist or marketplace

My question is should I really be maxing out my HSA every year at 31 years old?  I rarely go to the doctor unless it's a routine eye appointment or routine dental appointment.  And even then I don't use HSA funds to pay for it.

I guess my question is how much should I really be contributing to my HSA to have it set up for retirement in mid 50s?  Would it be better to contribute a little less to HSA and a little more to 401k?

146oyh1,CelticsWin7,"When trying to save money over the long term, is it better to buy a new vehicle around 35k or buy a used vehicle around 15k?

Assuming buying in cash and keeping either car as long as possible.

Basically is it better financially to keep buying reliable used cars around $15k every 4-6 years when  my car stops working, or is it better financially to buy brand new around 35k in thinking it will last 10+ years.

Specifically financially, which is better.

I'm guessing new would be better, I'm just trying to convince myself whether or not to buy 35k of my hard earned cash that took a long time to save up.

I'm looking mainly at used and new Toyota Camry, Honda Accord, etc.  Reliable cars.

I previously had a Chevy Impala and wouldn't mind buying another used Chevy Impala either.  Got it up to 192,000 miles from 32,000 when I bought it, before it got totaled last month.  I feel like I could have easily gotten 250,000-300,000 too.",No,Yes,No,No,Yes
14i1gj7,CelticsWin7,"Should I buy a used car or a 2023 Toyota Camry in 2023?

My car was totaled earlier this month and I need to get a car as Iâ€™m currently borrowing a car from family.

The car check payout was $5,570.  Iâ€™m trying to decide if itâ€™s better in the long run to buy a used 10-15k vehicle or get the 2023 Camry for about 35k.

I donâ€™t want to justify buying a brand new car but used cars are just so damn expensive nowadays.  Seems like the average used car between 10k-15k is 8-10 years old with 80k-150k miles on it.

On the financial Iâ€™m a saver and stubbornly frugal.  I can afford the new Toyota Camry, but Iâ€™m not sure I want to spend that much on a car.  On the flip side used car prices are really high and you canâ€™t really get much of a car for 10-15k.

So really itâ€™s either buy a 10k, 12k, or 15k car with 100,000+ miles on it and see how long it can last, or buy the new 2023 Toyota Camry for 35k with 0 miles on it.

As far as income goes I make about 60k annually.

Also because I was going to originally spend 15k on a used car, if I did get the 2023 Toyota Camry, I would put down at least 15k+ down payment and have a small monthly payment.  Thatâ€™s if I donâ€™t buy it outright.

Iâ€™ve been searching for weeks looking for a decent used car buy and itâ€™s getting a little frustrating.  When I have found decent buys online Iâ€™d call the dealership and either the price is higher, mileage isnâ€™t up to date, or it had a bad car fax.

Iâ€™m completely fine going used or new either way.  I just want to make the best financial decision for the long run.

Also to note:  the 2023 Toyota Camry is in transit and itâ€™s the only one available.  The dealership said I can put a $1000 down payment to hold it for me.

Would the Camry be worth it longer term?",No,Yes,No,No,No
14vat1o,CelticsWin7,"I desperately need a car, but don't know what to get?

I desperately need a car as my car was totaled last month.  I don't need anything fancy.  I can pay cash up to 15k-20k.  Ideally want to pay on the lesser side as I'll only be keeping this car for a short period of time maybe 6 months to 2 years.  More information below.

Something reliable with good gas mileage.  I drive 15k miles per years.  Prefer mid-side sedan over compact.

The last vehicle I had was a 2011 Chevy Impala.  Bought it at 34k miles and drove it to 193k miles before it was totaled.  Was very reliable.  Maybe had $2k in repairs over the 11 years I had it.

That said, I bought it with just 34k miles and always had the routine maintenance done.  I'm cautious that if I buy a car with 100k+ miles on it that it won't be as reliable as you never know how the previous owner(s) took care of it those first 100k+ miles.  As for now it's more about **needing a reliable car ASAP** to get to work and back.  I drive about 60 miles to work round trip 5-6 days a week. 

Inevitably I want to buy a **new Toyota Camry** when Toyota inventory comes back up next year or the year after, so whatever car I buy now probably only needs to last me maybe 2 years tops.

What kind of **mileage vehicle / price vehicle** am I looking at to last me 6 months to 2 years while driving 15k miles annually?  100k mileage?  150k mileage?  I found a 2011 Chevy Impala for $7.5k with 160k miles on it.  Doesn't seem like a terrible deal knowing I got my previous 2011 Impala to 193k miles before it was totaled, but I don't know.

2. Buy 2 used cars for about **$15,000-$25,000** with taxes and fees.

My Chevy Impala for the last 11 years was totaled about a month ago.  I couldn't decide what to buy so I just opted to buy another Chevy Impala since my last one was very reliable.  It has 160k miles which is a lot, but I'm hoping it will last at least 200k-250k miles.  Maybe this is wishful thinking, but my last Chevy Impala was at 193k miles before it was totaled and I had **no major problems** with it.  That said, I did regular maintenance and a lot of the miles were highway miles too.

So currently I have this 2011 Chevy Impala with 160k miles that I bought at the dealership recently for $7,000.  I'm thinking of either buying a new Camry while selling or trading in my Impala, or, keeping the Impala and **buying a backup car**.

Obviously the new Camry is the most reliable and long lasting car, but it's also $35,000 and the depreciation on new cars drop about 50% after the first 5 years of ownership.

Maybe the best choice is to buy a **5-10 year old Camry or Corolla?**  Then I can use the Impala as a backup vehicle and used Camry as main vehicle?  If I opt to buy another backup vehicle, instead of the new Camry, then I'll be looking at Facebook Marketplace first before the dealership.  Dealership has too high of markups on used vehicles.

I like the idea of owning a new car, but at the same time it's not something I **need.**  Also I should note the reason my car was totaled is because I hit a deer on the way to work.  In total I hit **3 deer** and **1 raccoon** and **narrowly avoided many other deer and raccoons**.  This is another reason why I'm hesitant on buying a 2023 Toyota Camry.

I think I've basically just talked myself into buying a used Toyota Camry type car while keeping the Chevy Impala, thoughts?",Yes,Yes,No,Yes,Yes

Example 2:

Say I have $40,400 in long term capital gains, in addition, I have $40,525 in ordinary income.  Does this mean the ordinary income would push the long term capital gains into the 15% tax bracket?

So in the first example, I have $53,350 long term capital gains and pay no taxes at all.  But in example 2, I make just $40,400, but have to pay 15% long term capital gains tax on all of it because the ordinary income pushes the capital gains into the next tax bracket.

Recently married with a 12 yo stepchild.  Partner and I are both 32 years old.  We're planning to have our own child within two years.  I make $108k, she makes about $60k.  Expensive COL area in Southern California.  Our realistic first home options are either a 3br condo or a 3br townhouse, each are in the $600k-700k price range current market.  We've saved up $104,500 towards a downpayment.  I'm able to save about $17k to $20k per year towards the downpayment.  My spouse can only save a few thousand per year (if that) due to high student debt burden.

How are young families affording these homes?  In order for us to save as much as we are now, we're not going on vacation, meal prepping, got eloped instead of a big wedding, no honeymoon, etc.  I feel like we're at a crossroads where housing costs are rising so fast that by the time we can actually afford 20% down, much of life will have passed us by.

Our rent for a 2br condo is currently $2200/mo, but we're expecting a 5-10% increase every year going forward based on the market trend.  I'd rather be building equity so we can retire in a home that we own and not be at the mercy of a landlord and potential rent increases.

Gross income between me ($110k) and wife ($60k) is about $170k. We live in Southern California in a high demand metro region. Weâ€™re currently renting a 2bed 2ba condo for $2200/mo, which is lower than the current market rate of about $2700-2800/mo. Our lease ends in three months and the landlord wants to increase rent by $250/mo with a one-year extension or $200/mo with a two-year extension. Weâ€™re at the point where we want to have a child, so weâ€™d like to get a 3 bedroom place. My stepdaughter occupies the second room.  We don't want to put off having a child for much longer, as we're approaching our mid-30's.

Three-bedroom rentals are going for about $3500/mo. A nice townhouse in my area is going for about $800k. We have $102k to put towards a down payment, which will bring our full-boat monthly payment to about $4200-4400/mo. We plan on renting out the third room in the new townhouse for $900-1000/mo. 

Iâ€™m really struggling with the idea of having a $4200-4400/mo payment. Iâ€™m trying to weigh this against the alternative of renting a three-bedroom place, or (even more depressing) not having a child. My thought is that rent will gradually increase to the point where in about 3-4 years, the rental rate for a three-bedroom might be around what will be my monthly payment anyways. The townhouse we plan to buy is on the higher end, so I think we can be satisfied with living there for 10+ years.

Right after the housing crash in 2008, CalPERS, the State's big pension system, discontinued their home loan program.  The loan program was supposedly managed by a company called Mountain West Financial.  Mountain West Financial now offers a program called ""CalPATH,"" which is not officially endorsed by CalPERS.  As a member of the CalPERS system, I was curious about this loan as I am buying my first home soon.  I asked them to send me the deal points that set them apart from any other loan provider and this what they sent me:

* 1% of the loan amount credit towards closing costs (free money you DO NOT pay back)
* $395 processing &amp; underwriting fee (normal non CalPATH fee is $1,895)
* Free rate float down (after offer being accepted, within 30 days of locking in your loan if rates improve minimum .125%. We will float your rate down for free)
* Free appraisal special (min. loan amount $400,000 and 700 fico score)
* Realtor network that you can choose from, they will credit you .50% of the purchase price towards closing costs.

t3qkj7,CenterKnurl,"Father Had Stroke, No Health Insurance, Nevada

**Summary**: Father is a self-employed in a skilled trade.  Had a stroke out of the blue (in his mid-50's) and does not currently have health insurance.  I've been called in (his daughter) to pick up the pieces.  He residents in Nevada and that's also where the stroke happened.  Stroke occurred during sleep.  Moderate stroke, led to a 4-day hospital stay at a County-run hospital where an MRI and numerous echos were conducted.  My dad is doing pretty well and is slowly getting back into work, but I can tell there's some residual confusion/disorientation.  He's probably 90-95% functional (based on me hanging out with him for a day or two).

**Insurance Going Forward**

My first goal here is to get him insured.  The hospital gave him two different paperwork packets.  The first is a Medicaid application.  The second is a charity care application.  According to the hospital, individuals must make $1483 or less per month to qualify for Medicaid.  My father is a sole proprietor, so he purposely keeps tabs on everything to ensure his reportable income remains as low as possible.  However, his income can fluctuate wildly though.  One month, he may make $10,000, the next month, $500.  How does this work with Medicaid?  Does some one have continuously apply and verify throughout the year?

**Paying Bills Soon to Accumulate**

Bills have not yet arrived, but we're preparing for some whoppers.  Hospital already offering a ""30% discount"" because he is considered ""cash pay.""  If he is approved for Medicaid, will Medicaid help pay for the hospital stay that already occurred retroactively?  What about if I get him signed up through the ACA exchange within the week? 

Next step will be to negotiate the bills down.  My dad owns his house and vehicles outright, but I'm concerned the bills (even under a payment plan) will be huge.  What can I do to minimize the impact this will have to his credit?

**Outside the Box Ideas**

It seems like some of their historical investments have been as high as 19% which would obviously put them at a much better advantage than an index fund. Just curious on what people's thoughts are as far as performance is concerned and if they prefer multifamily syndications for their immediate cash flow and tax efficiency over investing in index funds?

For context I do mostly invest in index funds today.",,,,,

After his withdrawal, he has lost 54% of his investment portfolio.

Mark owns a high yield stock mutual fund that also dropped 50% during the bear market. His high yield mutual fund has a 4% yield. The dividend is paid once a year every December. Mark pays his retirement bills with the 4% annual distribution from the dividend of his mutual fund.  Mark feels like a genius because he lives on dividends and does not touch the principal.

Jerry- who collected SS at age 62-  decided to challenge Ben to a contest. Starting at age 70 he would withdraw from his $220K nest egg the difference between their Social Security checks so they both were given the same amount of money per month. AGAIN, Jerry would withdraw about $1500 a month out of his $220K nest egg he got from investing his smaller SS checks for 8 years so he would have the same income as Ben.

There is some truth to it but I believe the statement at face value is false.  I believe that historically there are certain commonalities to the stock and bond markets that time and time again are true.  In other words, history repeats itself over and over so we can be 90% sure in the future it will keep happening:

**Here are some examples of investing rules of thumb that have been true historically and with 90% certainty will continue to be true:**

Short Term Bond funds are less volatile than Long Term Bond Funds

A Bear Market in short term and intermediate bond funds is not as harsh as a bear market in stocks

Growth Small Company stocks are more volatile than large blue chips

Consumer Staple Stocks are less volatile than NASDAQ Technology Stocks in a bear market

If Stocks crash in a bear market they go back up within a few years (Every bear market has had a recovery.)

If the economy continues to grow the stock market long term trend will be up.

f9t6fs,chargum,"Stock Market Experts thought the 2010-2019 decade would be weak

I can't find a link but I strongly remember a number of articles written by ""so-called"" stock market experts in 2009 that told us the upcoming decade of 2010-2019 would have poor stock market returns.  They told us that the Great Recession of 2007-2009 had caused a permanent decrease in our economy.

The CAGR for a total stock market fund was an annualized 13.30 for that ten year period. The CAGR for a total bond fund (intermediate) was an annualized 4.05%.

As stated I can't find the actual articles online from the Internet that told us that the 2010-2019 decade will be awful but maybe you guys can find it.

Now it is 2020 and those experts are at it again and just like ten years ago are telling us to expect stock and bond market returns well below the 50-year average.  Are these the same people who made predictions in 2009?  If so, why are they still working?

Here is the current expert analysis of stock and bond market expected returns for 2020 to 2029:

fchtku,chargum,"In a Bear Market, it is much better to break your investments in separate total stock and total bond funds than use balanced mutual funds in retirement

I want to show you the math behind the advantages of having separate total stock and total bond funds vs using balanced mutual funds.

Jim retired on October 1st, 2007 and had 2 Million Dollars in his 401K retirement account and is using the 4% rule and is planning on withdrawing a starting figure of $6666 a month which will be adjusted for inflation. He has two accounts 60% of his money is in a total stock market fund and 40% in a total bond market fund. Just when he retires the stock market starts to crash so he pulls his $6666 a month withdrawal out of his bond fund so he does not sell his stocks when they are down. On March 1, 2009, just before the stock market hits bottom he has $955,736 in his total Bond Fund and $519,680 in his total stock market fund. ($1,475,416 combined) Starting in March 2009 he took his monthly withdrawals equally from both funds. On February 2020 he has $2,598,449 left.

Peter also retired on October 2007 and had $2 Million in retirement and put it all in a 60-40 Mutual Fund. On March 1st he had $1,164,377 in his Balanced 60-40 Mutual Fund (FBALX) He took an inflation-adjusted starting amount of $6666.00 a month out of that fund from October 2007 to February 2020. So, in the end, on February 2020 he had $2,489,195 left.

Why the difference? Because Peter used a balanced mutual fund that was selling stocks during the Great Recession (due to the investment having 60% in stocks). While Jim only withdrew from his bond funds during the 2007-2009 stock market crash.

So I am having some upcoming life changes, and was hoping I could get some advice on filling out the 2023 W4. My end goal would be to get as close to not owing, but also not having too much of a refund at the end of the years as possible. Although, it doesn't need to be perfect. I just do not want it weighed heavily one way or the other. 

I am currently married and file jointly. I am making \~130,000/year and my spouse makes \~75,000/year. We have 1 dependent. We have some changes coming up, and I plan to redo both of our W4s. 

Starting next week, my spouse will be starting a new job making \~230,000-250,000/year. My spouse is pregnant and will only be working at the new job for about 3-6 weeks before needed to take a 3 month leave. After 3 months, my spouse will return to work full time at the job with the above salary. Obviously this will also increase our dependents to ""2"" come 3-6 weeks from now. 

My question is, what would be the best way to fill out our W4s to get as close to my original goal as possible? I am pretty new to the new W4s and am a bit confused. I am also not sure how my spouse taking a 3 month leave should be taken into consideration when adjusting our W4s. Will this change the timing of when to submit new W4s, etc.? A lot of threads say to use the calculator, but it requires things like paystubs, but we won't have access to these as this will be a brand new job. However, my spouse will need to fill out a W4 prior to employment within the next week.

14tp2yh,CHB12312,"Recommendations on personal finance podcasts/videos/books vs financial advisor

I was looking for some advise/recommendations regarding personal financing with some major changes that are happening in my life. I currently average 130k a year. I have two dependents (young children in daycare-AKA second mortgage) and my spouse is currently making \~70k a year but starting in a week will be making \~230-250k a year. We currently invest into our 401/403b and have a decent emergency fund on the side (as much as we can invest with currently having the costs of daycare/dependents). With my spouses income increasing significantly, we are obviously looking deeper into how to invest our money moving forward. It is important to note we also have \~350K in combined student debt for which we are about 5 years into PSLF payments (fingers crossed in 5 more years the remainder will actually be forgiven and we won't get screwed with an even higher balance after accrued interest)

I was considering a financial advisor, but I have heard a lot of mixed opinions on whether it is worth it and I don't want to lose out on a lot of money long term. I also considered maybe seeing if a financial advisor could help screen over our situation and start a portfolio and then we take it from there for a flat fee (if this is a thing?). 

However, I am also interested in learning more about personal financing myself. I feel like I have a decent understanding of the basics. I know to max out pre-tax accounts like 401k/403b first. Also maxing out the HSA (especially since I have dependents) which can also be used as a mini retirement account later in life. I have heard mixed things on backdoor roth (seems like some ppl say its worth the hassle, others think it is a minimal benefit for the work you put into it/risk of messing something up with taxes). So I keep going back and forth on whether to do this. However, when it comes to the more detailed stuff such as managing the stocks/bonds (what to put where) and then considering further investing of left over money in other index funds vs doing other things with the remaining money, this is where I feel less confident and don't want to make a detrimental mistake.

I guess my question is... is is worth working with a financial advisor with our current situation/incomes? Or should I be doing more research and trying to manage it myself? If the consensus is to manage it myself, does anyone have any advice on the better books/podcasts/videos that can get me started in starting to research this stuff?

Current situation: I make \~130k/year and my spouse was making \~80k/year. I believe we filled out the W4 by checking the 2(c) option on both of our W4s. We have both worked full time this year up until now. 

Upcoming situation: I will continue to make \~130k/year. However, my spouse started new employment earlier this week and will now be making \~220-250k/year (170k base and the rest with call pay, productivity bonuses, etc.). The caveat is that my spouse will likely work 4-6 weeks and then be taking a 3 month leave for the birth of a child. After that, my spouse will return to work full time. 

I am trying to decide the best way to fill out our W4s with this new change. I know to list the dependents on my spouses W4 (higher income W4). I hear the online calculator is the most accurate, however, my spouse won't get a pay check for \~ 3 weeks and even then it may not be the most accurate as it will be smaller than some other paychecks that will have call pay. 

What would be the best way to go about filling out our W4s to achieve my original goal? Here are the options I was thinking:

1: Using option 2(B) the multiple jobs worksheet as that uses both of our projected incomes. If I go this route, I believe we only fill this out on my spouses (higher income) W4, correct? And leave it blank on mine? 

2: Using the 2C option. However, I have heard mixed opinions on this. Is our income difference too much for this option? If so, what would it result in? Withholding too much from our paychecks?

So my spouse just started a new job and the salary is going from 80k to ~230k. The yearly contribution to the 403b is currently around 7k from her previous job. Obviously we will have a pretty significant income jump. She will also have to take off 3 months. So she will essentially work a total of 3 months by the end of year.

Two questions..

1) Is there a max per paycheck that you are aloud to contribute to your 403b?

2) If the above answer is â€œnoâ€â€¦ then does it make sense to start off with a large contribution towards her 403b (like 40%) for those 3 months to try and max out the rest of her 403b limit before the end of the year to try and take advantage of the pre-tax dollars and then switch back to a normal contribution in 2024?

We wanted a bigger house (we were renting) because we were having a baby at the time. We were able to get this house using a â€œdoctors loanâ€ knowing when my wife became an attending, income would significant change.

Itâ€™s now 2023 and we still owe 295k. I was just reviewing our personal finances as she just became an attending physician and our financial situation has obviously changed. However I am shocked after almost 5 years of ~$2,200 payments that we still owe 295k. 

I was looking at a mortgage statement form last month and it shows $500 towards principal, $1000 interest, ~$800 escrow. Seems crazy (although I understand without a down payment it will be higher). It just feels kind of defeating. 

So I guess I have a few questions with with our upcoming lifestyle changes taking place. 

1) From my research on this thread, I hear that typically you shouldnâ€™t focus on paying down mortgage as itâ€™s considered a low interest investment and money would be better focused elsewhere (such as maxing out 401ks, HSA, back door roths, etc). 

But with us having never put down a down payment, should we save up and try and put down 15-20% to lower the total loan some so we are not paying so much in interest? Or just focus our extra money elsewhere?

2) is this normal for only 1/4 of your total mortgage payment to actually go towards the principal? If soâ€¦ thatâ€™s lame. If not, what could I be doing wrong?",,,,,

My job offers a 401k. My spouses job offers a 403b and also has the option for a 457 (due to my spouses higher income). We also have an HSA account. We are also considering back door Roth accounts for the both of us.

She stayed on Cobra because she was close to her out of pocket max and if she switched to my health insurance, it wouldnâ€™t have covered her delivering at the hospital she was planning to deliver. 

She ended up delivering at the end of July. From my understanding you can terminate Cobra coverage at any time (pay on a monthly basis). I had called my HR before any of this happened and explained our situation. I asked if she terminated her coverage starting August 1st, if that would be considered a â€œqualifying life eventâ€ to allow me to place her in my employers health insurance. They told me that yes it would be because she is losing health coverage. We sent an email last week asking to terminate her Cobra after July 31st. 

However, now I am doing further research, and many websites are saying that you can terminate cobra at any time, but this is NOT considered a â€œqualifying life eventâ€ and that you would not be able to be added to a spouses insurance plan unless it was during open enrollment or you had another qualifying event. This is NOT what my HR told me when I called. Is this true? If so, I have no idea what to do because we have now emailed Cobra asking to terminate and I am worried they are going to deny my attempt to get her on my health insurance and she is going to be left without health insurance until next open enrollment which would be terrible as she just had a baby and will likely need multiple follow ups. 

What do I do? Is it true that this will not qualify as a life event and that I am not going to be able to get her on my insurance? If so, what options do I have. Do we try and call Cobra back on Monday and ask them not to cancel the coverage and just get screwed with $600 monthly payments until my next enrollment period?

My question is, what should we focus on next. Here are my thoughts:

1)  My spouses employer offers a 457b NON-governmental plan. This could be an additional $22,500 pre-tax dollars. However, I am concerned about it being non-governmental as we are young and it would probably be close to 25-30 years before we retire. That is a long time to have money in an account that we could potentially lose if things went south with the company. Realistically, it would probably never happen as it is a well known hospital with a current bond rating of AA, but you never knowâ€¦ a lot can change in 25-30 years. 

2) choosing a taxable brokerage account and start contributing to this post tax. We lose out on the pre-tax deductions, but at least I know it is safe and not subject to the employer staying in business

We are currently married filing jointly. we are both in our early 30s. I make ~$135,000/year. My spouse was in residency making $70,000/year but starts an attending position in October planning to make around $230-250,0000/year after call pay/bonuses. We live in a moderate cost of living area.

Mortgage: originally 330k, owe about 290k, monthly mortgage payment around $2,300

We have two children. One in daycare which is about $1,400/month and our other child is about to start so we will probably pay around $2,800 a month for daycare at least for the next year until the older child goes to school (so much money :( )

Other monthly costs such as utilities, food, gas, etc.

My car is paid off (worth about $15,000 currently)and my spouses car has about 30k left which comes out to ~$800 month.

No credit card debt

I have about $150,000 in student loans and she has about $225,000 in loans. We are currently pursuing PSLF and both work for qualifying employers and are both 5 years into it. We have paid almost nothing so far due to the COVID forbearance. Likely wonâ€™t have high payments for another year and half or two due to not needing to re certify income yet. So obviously the hope is that in 5 years we will have these loans forgiven for a fraction of the cost we pay.

We have a 401k with ~$90,000 and a 403b with ~$100,000

Between our savings/checking about $30,000

Obviously with her income increasing significantly, we plan to heavily focus on retirement investing. Going to start maxing out my 401k, her 403b, her 457b and plan to do a back door Roth for both of us. Also plan to max out HSA. This will hopefully reduce our taxable income by a lot, reduce our student loan payments, and start catching us up for saving for retirement.

With the remaining money I am considering placing into a HYSA until closer to the 5 year mark to make sure that PSLF actually works. That way if for sone reason it fell through, I could dump that money on it to help pay it off.

What do you guys think? Are we in a decent place financially? Do my future goals seem reasonable? Is there any changes I should make? Am I putting too much of our income towards retirement/investment accounts (I.e maybe hold off on the 457b for now or something?)

I appreciate any advice.",,,,,

My spouses employer is a pretty major hospital system. Obviously we would like to think that nothing would ever happen to them, but we canâ€™t help but worry about that. 

I guess my question would beâ€¦ do you think itâ€™s worth the risk to take advantage of the pre-tax deductions which will also lower our taxable income? Or should we direct remaining money elsewhere such as a taxable brokerage account to be safer and not have to worry about losing our money if something bad happened to the company?

17zz326,CHB12312,"Seeking Help on Path to Financial Independence

Here are the current numbers....

Married filing jointly with 2 children. We are in our mid 30s. Combined annual income of about 360-380k/year (recently increased to this amount, previously around 190k)

Auto loan \~$30,000 at 4%. Second car is paid off and worth about 16k 

Mortgage: 290k (original 325k) at 4%. House is now worth 500k in current market

Student Loans: I have about 120k and my spouse has about 225k. We are currently pursuing PSLF. Both 5 years into it. Currently low monthly payments (<$10) because still using pre-covid income. This will change obviously. Our plan is to make the minimum payment on SAVE plan for another 5 years and hopefully have this forgiven

401k- $95,000 and a 403b with $100,000

HYSA $15,000; checking $12,000

Sadly with 2 children have to pay around $3200/month in daycare costs (hoping when the one starts going to kindergarten that the before/after day care will be cheaper?

Leftover pay after all our expenses each month: About $5,000-$6,000/month

**Our current plan:** Max the 401k, 403b, max backdoor roth for both of us, max HSA. My spouse also qualifies for a 457b which we are considering maxing as well. The largest stressors for me is the student loans. Obviously if PSLF works out, this will make a huge impact on our financial situation. However, I am a pessimistic, so I would like to be prepared in case for some reason it doesn't work out in 5 years. So my thought was taking the extra 5-6k we make each month and just dumping it into a HYSA so that way if at 5 years the PSLF doesn't work, I can use that amount to pay off the majority of student loans. If PSLF does work out, great I will invest/use that money to pay off any other debts at that time

This above plan may change some once we have to recertify incomes in the next 1-2 years as we will then likely have a decent sized student loan monthly payment (not sure how much this will be with out debt to income ratio).

How does our path to FI look so far? I often stress with the large amount of student debt and can't help but feel like FI is far off for us. It feels even harder with the cost of everything going up with inflation and childcare costs being so expensive. We are in medicine, so we are getting a bit of a late start. Is there any other adjustments to our plan that you would recommend? I appreciate any advice/feedback.

10cp4dg,ChiSouthSider43,"Financial Picture - ready to buy a new car?

I am trying to evaluate whether or not I'm ready to buy a new car. I know a car isn't a ""smart"" financial move; that's not what I'm trying to figure out here. More like do I need to have anything else in order before I make this purchase. 

My financial picture:

* 36 years old
* 6-month emergency fund
* $34k invested in 403b
* $20k saved for new car
* $10k in additional savings (outside of EF)
* Gross annual pay: $75,000
* Debt includes $82k mortgage balance and $129k in student loans (I know this number is astronomical. Mistakes were made in my early 20's. Interest has killed me because the original amount of these loans was only about half of this. Good news is I'm a teacher and this balance is about to be forgiven through PSLF. Just waiting on MOHELA to process my last form).
* No other debt
* I feel I'm a little behind in retirement savings, but I'm a single parent and for years I was trying to get on solid financial ground. It's just the last 2-3 years I've gotten on solid ground and been able to contribute a nice chunk to retirement. I'm also a teacher and in addition to the 403b, I will be eligible for a pretty good pension upon retirement.
* Take home pay after taxes, insurance, and 15% to 403b: $1900/paycheck
* I save an additional $400/paycheck to various sinking funds, so net after additional savings is $1,500/paycheck or $3,000/month
* Total monthly bills: $2,200. That's everything - mortgage, food, utilities, gas, car insurance, student loan payment, medication, subscriptions.

Car information:

* I want to buy a new SUV that costs $38k. I plan on doing a $20k down payment (I have been saving for about 5 years). I've been driving my current car for 10 years. It's not necessarily on its last leg, but repairs are starting to get more expensive (just dropped $1900 on it a few months ago).

I've been working on my 2022 tax return (largely to decide if I need to make a Q4 estimated tax payment or if I already paid enough in the first three quarters), and I discovered a funny bug in TurboTax.  I prepared my return in both FreeTaxUSA and TurboTax, and FreeTaxUSA showed a refund that was hundreds of dollars larger.  After going through the forms, I found the difference on line 8 of Form 8959 (Additional Medicare Tax, where household income over a certain threshold is taxed an extra 0.9%).  The value on Form 8959 line 8 comes from Schedule SE line 6, and FreeTaxUSA brought it over just fine, but TurboTax doubled it, resulting in hundreds of dollars more in tax.

As I messed around trying to fix the problem, I eventually figured out that TurboTax has two versions of Schedule SE, which show up as ""Sch SE-T"" and ""Sch SE-S.""  I also figured out that TurboTax uses Sch SE-T for self-employment income that's attributed to the first-named person on a joint return and Sch SE-S for self-employment income attributed to the second-named person (I suspect the ""T"" stands for ""taxpayer"" and the ""S"" stands for ""spouse"").  In any event, when I change my return so the person with the self-employment income is named first (and TurboTax uses Sch SE-T), the error on Form 8959 goes away.  When I change it back, so the person with the self-employment income is named second (and TurboTax uses Sch SE-S), the error reappears.",,,,,

hy976w,cloister-fuck,"What if you stuck to an all-stock retirement portfolio and never held bonds?

Let me preface this by saying I assume I'm wrong / missing something, because everyone seems to know that bonds are an important part of one's portfolio (specifically, they help reduce volatility, and the closer you get to retirement, the more of your portfolio they should make up).  I keep wondering, though, don't bonds reduce volatility at the expense of returns?  Assuming that's right, what if you simply didn't care about volatility (you have nerves of steel or whatever) and had a flexible enough time-horizon that you could wait out any downturn or otherwise minimize sale of stocks that are down?  Bottom-line: Would an all-stock portfolio outperform a portfolio with bonds across the long term?

Even if we imagine a worst-case scenario in which a major downturn coincides with your retirement, wouldn't decades of maxed-out growth help your overall position (again, assuming that's what you'd get by being all in stocks)?  Sure, your portfolio would be down -- maybe way down -- but it'd be down from a higher high, right?  Also, it's not like you're going to liquidate your entire portfolio the day you retire -- you'd only sell enough for that week or month or whatever, so while it sucks to sell low, there'd be plenty other times when you'd get to sell at record highs (assuming a long enough retirement), and wouldn't continuing to max out growth be beneficial during retirement, as well?

I assume people have run simulations on this and concluded that we're better off with bonds (and an increasing amount of bonds as we approach retirement), but it's just never made sense to me.

snrdxc,cloister-fuck,"Employer social security contributions when total income from multiple jobs exceeds the maximum

When total income from multiple jobs exceeds the social security maximum and excess social security tax is withheld, an employee can get the excess refunded at tax time ([https://www.irs.gov/taxtopics/tc608](https://www.irs.gov/taxtopics/tc608)).  How does this work on the employer side, though?  Given a single job, when an employee reaches the social security maximum, both the employee AND the employer stop paying their respective 6.2%, right?  In the case of an employee with multiple jobs, though, do the employers just end up overpaying social security for the employee?  Or do they somehow get their excess payments refunded, too?  Are refunds to employers (if there are any) pro-rated based on how much the employee earned from each employer?

My reason for asking actually has to do with self-employment income in addition to W-2 income.  To make things simple, let's suppose someone earns exactly the social security maximum ($147k for 2022) in W-2 income and another $147k in self-employment/1099 income.  The employee only has to pay social security tax on $147k, but what about the employer side?  Can the entire employer responsibility be put on the W-2 employer and the self-employment/1099 income be taken free of social security tax (thus netting the self-employed individual an additional 6.2%)?  That's great for the employee (and a bit unfair to the W-2 employer), but how does it work in actual practice?

x3fe5u,cloister-fuck,"Employer 401k error corrected but still costing me money

I'm paid semi-monthly, and as a result of a payroll error, basically my entire mid-August paycheck went into my 401k.  My company quickly issued a paper check for the correct amount and told me the 401k side would be corrected within a couple of weeks.  Now that my end-of-month paycheck has come through (with everything correct), I logged into my 401k account to see how they handled the correction.  What they did was liquidate and withdraw a dollar amount equal to the huge mid-August contribution minus the sum of the correct mid-August contribution and the correct end-of-August contribution.  That works in dollar terms, but in terms of shares, I'm short of where I should be by a decent amount due to market movements between the middle and end of August.

I really want this fixed this so I end up with the number of shares I would have had if this hadn't gotten messed up in the first place, but I thought I should ask on this sub first.  Is this normally how employer errors are corrected?  If not, how could they do better?  If they give me the missing shares in the form of an additional employee contribution, I'll still end up losing some tax-sheltered space (since I expect to hit the $20,500 limit).

y0jpbx,cloister-fuck,"Iâ€™ve done some tax loss harvesting. When using losses to offset gains/income, where do dividends fit in? What about interest?

As I understand it, realized investment losses can be used to offset an unlimited amount of realized investment gains.  If there are still losses beyond that, those losses can be used to offset ordinary income up to a maximum of $3,000.  And if there are still losses beyond that, they can be carried forward to the next tax year, at which point the process starts over with offsetting realized investment gains, etc.  (All of my realized losses are short term, so Iâ€™m glossing over short term vs. long term gains and losses.)

Anyway, assuming the above is correct, I just wanted to ask where dividends fit in.  Are they realized investment gains (subject to unlimited offset)?

I'm having a bit of a tough time picking what insurance we should get for next year. Some context: My wife will almost certainly max out any limit that she has. She regularly goes to Therapy, PT, and for the last few years she's unfortunately been in and our of the hospital for various things, all of which are out of her control. There's some injections/back issues that are in play for next year too. The rest of the family (me and the kid) are generally very healthy, and don't really go to the doctor that much, mostly just generic preventative type stuff. Obv could change, but that's been the history.

My options are:  
Traditional: $441/month (fam), $1k deductible (personal), $3k deductible (fam), 20% co-insurance for most services, $4k max OOP (personal), $12k max OOP (fam), co-pays are flat fees depending on the service

HDP: $310/month (fam), $2k deductible (personal), $4k deductible (fam), 20% co-insurance for more services, $6k max OOP (personal), $9.1k max OOP (fam), co-pays are 20% for all services, company kicks in $1,200 as a side benefit to the HPHD

The way that I'm thinking about this:

The wife will max out the OOP most likely regardless of the limit. The fam will likely not, but could obv. If the wife maxes her OOP, on the trad we're paying \~9k (440\*12+4000) + whatever the rest of the fam needs. On the HDHP we're paying \~9.7k ($310\*12+6000), less the $1.2k that work kicks in. Also less the tax benefit of the HSA which will max out (or approx $7k \* 25%) so -1.7k in taxes.

Also, if it happens that worst case the whole get super sick, the Traditional plan has 8k in extra OOP that we'd have to cover over the wife's limit, where as with the HDP there's only a max of 3k in extra costs we'd have to cover.

How would I figure out how much tax I actually paid on my business income when it's rolled into the total family income on my 1040 tax return?

Then at the end the of the year we file and do all of our normal stuff, inclusive of a Schedule C. But during the year, I'm also making money via my company and we pay taxes on that too. At the end of the year, we either get money back or owe them more money, some portion of that would apply to the business income/taxes part of the family.

But that 30% that I estimated would just be just that. An estimate. What is the real tax paid on my business income?

Assuming it's at the marginal tax rate on top of my pay seems bad because that's assuming that it's all 'after' other money we make. Which isn't really accurate.

Assuming that it's at the effective tax rate that we paid on total income seems plausible, but means that credits/deductions the family got for the year would affect the estimated tax rate. This does however seem like the better of the two methods.

jfhijs,code-baby,"How much should I have invested in my ESPP as a % of my total retirement savings?

Hello everyone,

I've been reading a number of the threads here, and some really good advice, so thanks in advance!

&amp;#x200B;

My wife and I are blessed that we have a (relatively) decent amount of income we are able to put towards retirement savings each month given recent life/job changes, but now we are stuck trying to figure out where to invest the money.

I have an ESPP plan that we (almost) max out each pay period for $450/month (max $600/month), and 401k contributions are \~$1,500 per month (well past the max for the company match point, which nets us another +$600/month).  Thus far we have not sold any of the stock as we feel that the company is on a solid upward trajectory, we were trying to avoid short term capital gains taxes, and because the raw amount was not enough to spend much time thinking about.

Right now, we have \~$5k in company stock (mix of long term and short term at this point), and \~$75k in 401 savings (mostly large cap targeted retirement date funds through Fidelity if it matters).  The primary question is, when does the stock % become too high that I'm too tied to strongly to my companies results?  And/or should I sell some of it an invest it in something else?

Side question that I have (after reading this article [ESPP Contributions)](https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/8oso8o/how_much_should_i_contribute_to_my_employee_stock/), is should I be selling the stock right way and trying to reinvest it in something else?  I understand the relative value of selling it immediately, as I can capture the return on investment and put it somewhere else.  But that feels like it only nets me value if I can invest it into something that would have a higher return than the expected return of the company stock, is that correct?  The $$ profit realized on the stock is something that I would realize in the generalize long term regardless of when sold, so I think it would just be a question of which investment generates the highest likely return (company stock vs other investment)?

Final question, should I be maxxing out the ESPP for the remainder of the $150 per month?  One of the reason that we haven't thus far is for diversifications reasons, but related to my main question, that might not be something that I need to worry about and it might just be a fancy buzz word that misapplying.  The choice to max it out would probably involve putting less towards the 401k contributions, or not making extra payments on the mortgage as right now we're not strongly considering other life style changes to reduce expenses and save more.  (But we might in the future.)

And after typing this and re-reading, I guess one other thought is that we should consider selling the long term options and using those proceeds to max out the new stock purchases and capture a second round of discount/return.  Is that the right way to think about it?

&amp;#x200B;

Edited since I didn't say it specifically before:  I get a 15% discount on the ESPP purchases, and it's discounted from the 'lower of the purchase date or start of period'.

Evening,

I see much advice about having an emergency fund, and it being 3m to 6m worth of expenses, which makes sense for a single person, but how should I adjust that for a 2 income family?

The lady and I operate on the idea that it's very unlikely that both of us will lose our job at the same time (very different industries) and so we are taking the lower of our incomes, assuming that's 'fixed' and then calculating how much we'd need to survive with just that income for 6 months.  Is that reasonable method?

Numbers based example: 1 person makes 70k/year, another makes something higher.  So monthly income if 1 person loses their job is at least 70k\*.70 (taxes) or \~4k/month.  Our semi-committed expenses are \~$5,500 per month.  So our emergency fund is \~$10k.

Also, from what I can tell, we can both contribute 6k/year to an IRA (combined between Traditional and Roth) so we can contribute 12k total, is that right?

However, it looks like since we are covered by a work program, we might be phased our of the deductible limits for IRA contributions based on [https://www.fool.com/taxes/401k-ira-maximum-contribution-limits-for-2021/](https://www.fool.com/taxes/401k-ira-maximum-contribution-limits-for-2021/), correct?

Now we're clearly in a much better place

* Combined income of \~200k per year
* 150k in various retirement accounts
   * 74k in my current company 401k
   * 22k in my previous company 401k
   * 12k in wife's Roth IRA from forever ago (Edward Jones, we're working to close and roll into the new vanguard account)
   * 12k in two new Roth accounts we just opened with Vanguard this year
   * 32k in my current company stock (partially RSUs vesting over 3 years), I max out my ESPP each period, which gives a 15% discount on cheaper of start or end of period price.  I'm willing to hear input on selling the non-RSUs, but honestly, I likely won't, I'm *very* bullish on the company, despite the 'too many eggs in 1 basket' risk

We contribute 17% of my paycheck to my company's 401k (company kicks in another 6%) so that I max out the 19k yearly limit, plan to contribute 6k/year to each of our Roth IRAs in perpetuity, she is just now eligible for her company 401k, so we'll start contributing \~6% of her income to that (which maxes out the company match), and increase to the 20k limit over the next two or three years as incomes hopefully go up.

We also contribute \~5k total per year to HSAs at both of our companies.

The CC debt is gone (except revolving monthly spending for cash back rewards), the family debt is gone, student loans are down to 55k (and holding while interest is free) mortgage is down to 210k and we're paying it off on a 13 year timeline.

&amp;#x200B;

All of this 'feels' like I'm on the right track, but I find it really hard to get a sense of if we'll be ok in retirement at this rate or not.  Things that throw me for a loop:

* We're 'making' 200k right now, but in no way do we live like we do.
   * Given how much we put towards retirement (which we obviously wouldn't do in retirement)
   * We max out the DCFSA for our kid (thanks gubbament for the free money!) which we won't have in retirement
   * We're aggressively paying off the mortgage which we won't have in retirement
   * We have half baked plans to have another kid in another year or so, and then move into a new house \~2 years after that but rent our current house, and I've no idea how to think about how that will affect the long term plans

&amp;#x200B;

So it's really hard to know are we on track for a similar quality of life, something worse, something better?  If I just ignore the retirement savings, DCFSA, and mortgage, that's almost 50k a year in extra income that we don't 'need' to have the same quality of life.  So is it correct to assume that if we have retirement income of 150k, we'd be in \~the same boat?

Also I have no idea how to think about inflation.  A quick calculation on this site:

[https://smartasset.com/retirement/retirement-calculator](https://smartasset.com/retirement/retirement-calculator)

Suggests that 125k/year in income now may need to be \~225k/year to 'feel' the same.

And maybe as a more important question, what high level things would you recommend that we look into in order to better our situation?

pybkyx,code-baby,"Use HELOC to Pay for (part of) Student Loans

The wife and I are considering taking out a HELOC (in Jan) to pay down our student loans.

The loans are at a blended \~5.5%, while the HELOC would be \~3.25% with no fees to take out the loan.

We diligently pay our bills / mortgage / cc bills so that we have no revolving debt.  We've been abstaining from paying student loan bills for the last 1.5 years because no interest and instead shoving the money into our retirement accounts.  And we have no issues with the actual payments of the student loans, we're more just considering ways to reduce interest.

I'm aware of the concept of not trading unsecured debt for secure debt (no one wants to lose their house due to not paying their student loans), but the opportunity to reduce our interest rate is tempting.

We have also considered using a private company to refi the loans into something with a lower interest but most of what I can find is either 4.00%+ or includes fees to refi which feels like throwing away money.  If it matters at all, on our current time table, the student loans will be paid off in \~5.5 or 6 years.  Alternatively if my research just sucks, and there's somewhere I should look to refi them with better rates / lower fees, that would be great too!

I have an IRA with Edward Jones and many of the investment in the account are with proprietary funds that I don't believe can be managed/actively invested in by outside companies.

I started thinking about this yesterday, and it hurt my brain.

I get paid every other week, so 26 pay checks a year.  During the course of the year, my yearly gross pay equals 26 \* gross amount on the paycheck, and equals my 'salary' as offered / expected, and this is what shows up in my bank account (less taxes, retirement, whatever).  Life is happy.  Example:  52k/year or 2k/pay check.

But once in every 10 or so years, there will be 27 pay periods, meaning that in that year I'm getting 27 \* my gross amount, so basically 3% more that year in cash.  Since there's never a year in which I'm getting less than 26 pay periods, does this essentially mean that I'm making more money that year than my stated pay or am I thinking about this wrong?",,,,,

The wife and I started using 1 joint card 3 or 4 years ago because it's easier and we like the rewards.

Recently a number of our cards have sent us letters saying they will close them due to inactivity. How much should we care about this?
We have no need of the actual credit limits as our primary card limit is vastly (10x) more than any normal monthly spend, but what sort of dent could this in theory put into my/our credit scores?

xf7ad9,code-baby,"Selling Company ESPP Stock, Sell Recent Stock or Older Stock

As the title implies, I don't know what the best bet is from a long term standpoint.

My newer stock (in the last year or two) has an average appreciation of \~30%, and would be taxed as short term capital gains on the profits. But my net cash in hand would be higher since gains are notable less (higher basis) and thus less taxes.

The older stock (older than 2 years) has an average appreciation of \~200%, but would be taxed at more favorable rates.

So it mostly comes down to a question of should I recognize the gain now and pay the taxes now or wait till later? One factor that I'm considering is that in future years we will likely go over the Roth ITA contribution limit, so we might better off selling now and recognizing the income so that if we sell in future years we don't price our self out of that option.

The goal here is to re-invest, so it's not specifically a cash flow question (i.e. not trying to go buy a car or house or anything).

The wife and I are setting some new goals to travel more and do more fun stuff, while still living inside our means. One area that we think that we have a ton of opportunity is our 'grocery' spending. This generally includes anything that we'd buy at a grocery store including places like Wally World.

So from a practical standpoint, this would include actual groceries, beer, special foods (fancy cheeses, meats) health and beauty stuff (makeup, vitamins), baby stuff (food mostly) and household stuff (cleaners, bug spray, small kitchen stuff). Ideally we'd subdivide that into some other groups to have a better sense of where the money is going and where we have room to cut back.

Purchasing it in 2, 3, 4+ different transactions when we're there seems tedious as best, and painful/useless at worse. Reading back through the receipts seems terrible.

**Do you currently** have any disorder, condition, or disease or are you currently taking prescription medication for any disorder, condition, or disease (other than: allergies; cold; or cough)?

* Cancer, tumors;
* Respiratory disease or disorder of the lungs;

* Kidney, liver or pancreas disease or disorder;
* Diabetes;
* Mental or nervous disorder;

(I went to a cardiologist over a year ago for mild intermittent chest pain I was getting. We did a stress test and an echocardiogram and both came back negative.

Nationwide protests have cast a spotlight on racism and inequality in the United States. Now a major bank has put a price tag on how much the economy has lost as a result of discrimination against African Americans: $16 trillion.

Since 2000, U.S. gross domestic product lost that much as a result of discriminatory practices in a range of areas, including in education and access to business loans, according to [a new study](https://ir.citi.com/NvIUklHPilz14Hwd3oxqZBLMn1_XPqo5FrxsZD0x6hhil84ZxaxEuJUWmak51UHvYk75VKeHCMI%3D) by Citigroup. It's not an insignificant number: By comparison, [U.S. GDP](https://www.bea.gov/news/2020/gross-domestic-product-2nd-quarter-2020-second-estimate-corporate-profits-2nd-quarter) totaled $19.5 trillion last year.

And not acting to reverse discriminatory practices will continue to exact a cost. Citigroup estimates the economy would see a $5 trillion boost over the next five years if the U.S. were to tackle key areas of discrimination against African Americans.

""We believe we have a responsibility to address current events and to frame them with an economic lens in order to highlight the real costs of longstanding discrimination against minority groups, especially against Black people and particularly in the U.S.,"" wrote Raymond J. McGuire, a vice chairman at the bank and the chairman of its banking, capital markets and advisory team.

Wall Street itself has also faced accusations for years of discriminatory practices against African Americans, such as limiting approval for mortgages or not providing enough banking options in minority neighborhoods, which are among the damaging actions identified by Citigroup researchers.

Specifically, the study came up with $16 trillion in lost GDP by noting four key racial gaps between African Americans and whites:

* $13 trillion lost in potential business revenue because of discriminatory lending to African American entrepreneurs, with an estimated 6.1 million jobs not generated as a result
* $2.7 trillion in income lost because of disparities in wages suffered by African Americans
* $218 billion lost over the past two decades because of discrimination in providing housing credit
* And $90 billion to $113 billion in lifetime income lost from discrimination in accessing higher education

As a result, Citigroup urges a slew of actions to reverse discriminatory practices and boost GDP over the next five years, including addressing the wage gap suffered by African Americans and promoting diversity at the top within banks and companies.

Citigroup's recommendations aren't new: Various studies have shown similar findings, and experts have called for similar action for years, though so far progress has been slow.",,,,,

p1lsn2,CoffeeQID,"(NY) Surprise medical bill question

Got a \~$30,000 surprise medical bill in the mail. Long story short, on Halloween last year of 2020 I fractured my nose surfing and had to get \~20 stitches in the ER. I actually work as an RN at the hospital I was treated and have their employee insurance so obviously I was covered and everything SHOULD have been in-network. The ER doc asked me if I wanted plastics to stitch up my nose. I'm 28 years old so of course I said yes as I didn't want horrible scarring. As soon as the plastic surgeon walked up to my stretcher, the first thing I said was ""are you in-network?"" ""I work here at the hospital and have the employee insurance"". He assured me he was and not to worry.

6 months later I get the $30,000 bill. Insurance cut me an out-of-network benefit check for \~$3,000 which I gave to the provider. Provider still wants the other \~$27,000. Someone showed me a link to this thing where you can sign and send copies to your insurance and provider and apparently, I guess it absolves you of responsibility? I already tried appealing insurance for more money, it was denied. The provider stated to me that they also appealed and I'm assuming it was also denied as they just sent me another bill in the mail. 

Here is the link: [https://www.dfs.ny.gov/system/files/documents/2020/07/oon\_aob\_form.pdf](https://www.dfs.ny.gov/system/files/documents/2020/07/oon_aob_form.pdf)

The bill got knocked down to about $6,000 which is great but still way too much. NY state told me that: ""I have what is known as a self-funded health plan.Â  Under a self-funded plan an employer collects premiums, puts them in a fund, and then pays for the employees' health care costs out of that fund set aside for medical expenses.Â  This arrangement is not considered insurance.Â  You filed a patient dispute with DFS because you don't have insurance subject to NYS legislation that would hold you harmless.""

 ""Want to really make your paperwork complicated? Contribute to your IRA each month and convert it each month. Then you have 12 contributions and 12 conversions to keep track of each year.

Pretty much what the title says and I guess this is more philosophical than a financial question but when we do eventually retire and itch closer and closer to death (think being around 70-80 something), should we keep money in our investments and the bank still at that point? I mean we retire because working becomes more annoying than the money is worth, otherwise we'd keep working all our lives.

Now, I understand hoarding some in your old age if you have a family and needs to be tended to after death but I don't have any kids and the only person I plan on having to be cared for after my death would be pets (whom I would leave to my younger brother). Henceforth, wouldn't it make sense to at some point just cash out your remaining investments and have some fun with them? I know of course, this might sound dumb because you don't know when you'll actually die but assuming you keep easily enough to keep your housing, food, and medical bills in order for the rest of your life, then wouldn't throwing out the last remaining bits on people and experiences you enjoy make sense? I wouldn't necessarily spend it on materialistic items seeing as those will simply be gone when you die but the rest could leave a lasting impact or even help others. I just keep thinking about this because in Sweden, they do ""death cleaning"" when they're approaching their elderly age in which they throw away or give away materialistic items so their inheritors don't have to go through it all and determine what to do with it all.

I'm only using my base pay for my budget since my bonuses are one time payments that I'll use to save for one time things like a house, grad school, wedding, honeymoon, etc. but that'll be roughly $57k pre tax

I will be starting a new job, where I will be making considerably more than my new job but the take home will be less because I will investing my money a whole lot more and my COL is also going up.

Currently I make $60k from work and about $25K from my side hustle. I only invest 8% into my 401K and nothing else. I have no money invested into a Roth IRA or HSA or stocks. On a normal month, after monthly expenses including rent, my take home is roughly $3k.

With my new job, I will be making $92.7K base, $18K annual bonus, and $39K performance bonus. I also make about $22k from a side hustle. My work is also giving me $625 per month pre tax for a car allowance if I buy a car 5 years or newer so I'm going to take advantage of that plan. I'm only using my base pay for my budget since my bonuses are one time payments. 

After heavily studying the flowchart on this subreddit, here's the best monthly budget plan I came up with:

**Take home pay (including car allowance) after contributing 15% to my 401K: $5240**

**Total take home including side hustle is \~$7090**

Rent &amp; Utilities: $1650

Car payment, insurance, parking and gas: $975

Eating out and Groceries: $600

Gym and medicine: $90

Fun money and subscriptions(only $50): $350

Roth IRA or stocks (I'm having trouble picking which one): $500

Sending Money to Parents: $200

**In all, my total monthly expenditure: \~$4360**

**Net savings: $2730**

I'll use my bonus money to max out my HSA at the end of every year, and I'll make around $40k post tax from all my bonuses.

Regardless, considering how much I'm making, I feel like I'm not putting enough into my savings every month to feel comfortable. I have $40k in my checking right now as my emergency fund, and to save for a house, wedding, etc.

I know the general rule of thumb is to invest 30-35% of your pre tax income, but taking into account only my W-2, I'm only investing 21%. I would not feel comfortable at all with my monthly net savings if I invested 30%.

This all being said, I was wondering if my net monthly savings is enough for me to feel secure or if I should be saving more monthly, and any other advice?

Hi!

I (23) am a recent college graduate who wants to maximize my savings in long and short term, but am not very financially literate so I was hoping for some advice.

Background:

I recently started a job with a salary of 60K, and i am assuming that I will get raises and promotions in the future, along with a supplemental income. i put in 8% into my 401K and my company matches 3%. The max my company will match is 37.5% up to 8% of my compensation. How that works is if I were to contribute 8% of my compensation, my company will match 37.5% of that amount. Any additional contribution will not be matched. 37.5% of 8% is a 3% match. I know i should be putting in more than 8% but I am currently cash poor right now due to some personal emergencies. After taxes, 401K, health, etc. i bring home around $4500, including supplemental income. My expenses are roughly $1700/month. I will have a savings of about $14500 (after paying for all my emergencies) at the end of this month and have about $2000 in my 401k which I have not invested into anything (I would like to invest it but have no idea where to start). I have school debt of $21k of which i will start paying $200/month starting next month (unless you guys have a better suggestion. I am moving across the country in July and my moving expenses will be about $1500.

I know HSAâ€™s are great if your employer offers them. My employer offers a silver PPO plan with an HSA, as well as lots of gold/platinum non-HSA plans for the same cost.

My employer pays 100% of my insurance premium.

HSAâ€™s are amazing, but also are seen as good options because of lower premiums. Since I wonâ€™t have a premium, is it still a better choice to get a lower quality plan for an HSA? My healthcare costs are fairly low - prescription and a few tests/visits per year. Itâ€™s difficult to predict costs which is why 25% coinsurance with the HSA is a little concerning when I have a better, more predictable option at no extra cost.

Original post:

My employer matches 25% of the first 6% and I make ~120k a year. I was eligible to start contributing to the 401k starting in July, but I did not actually start putting money in until October because of clerical errors on my HRâ€™s end (the HR department is one person, and it has been really difficult to get any clear information or help from them in general). I set my contributions super high to try to offset this (like 40% of my income) and get a decent amount contributed for 2021. I have contributed 12k at this point, well over 6% of my yearly salary.

Shouldnâ€™t my employer match be ~$1800 now? Because currently it says only $418.

Here's some quick info: 29 year old single male, make about $80000 in a union trade., currently in my second year of apprenticeship. I currently have an Emergency fund of $11,000 (which covers 6 months of expenses, something I really don't want to touch). I'm currently paying $500/month (min. payment is $259) towards my student loans, which has an interest rate of 7.14% and a balance of $9784. I'm also contributing 15% of my paycheck (about $240/week) towards a 401k. Through my employer i also have an annuity (balance of $25,000, this is based on the hours I work) and a pension (balance of $34,000). 

&amp;#x200B;

If i continue to pay $500 a month it would take me about 21 months to pay off my SL entirely. I am thinking of stopping my 401k contribution for the next few months and throwing everything towards my SL. This would make it about a $1400/month payment and I would be able to pay it off in about 7 months. I also sporadically throw a few hundred at my SL when i save more during the month which could make it about 5 or 6 months. Once these are paid off I would immediately start contribution 20% of my paycheck (about $315) back into my 401k to kick start that again.

My question is whether this would hurt me a little in the long term? Obviously we're only taking half a year but that could be about $4000 that i lose in contributing to my 401k.

Option A - Keep the $15,000 in my E. Fund, throw all excess money after bills throughout the next few months and have my loan paid off by September/October (would be paying about 1700-2000/month).

Option B - Pay off the Student Loans now and have that done with. My E-fund would be down to $7,000 but I could save the money I'd use towards the loan and get that E-fund back to $15,000. Obvisouly the big draw to this is I'd be done with my student loans and my only other debt would be my car.

if2nw7,CuriousernCurioser,"How to choose a financial advisor/planner.

If you want to do it yourself thatâ€™s fine. If youâ€™d prefer to hire a professional these are the 3 questions to ask. 

1) Are you a CFP? 

CFPs are the cream of the crop in the industry. They go through more extensive education and training and have experience requirements that donâ€™t exist for your average advisor. 

2) Do you charge fees or commissions?

You want to eliminate the conflicts of interest between you and your planner as best as possible. Commissions for trades are the worst compensation structure because they are getting paid regardless of the advice they give. Flat monthly fees are best because the advisor is now being compensated for the advice they give and not just the investments. Fee based and and Fee for assets model are the most common and fine as long as the advisor is worth the advice they are giving. Many of the best planners charge a fee for assets under management because itâ€™s the most lucrative business model and they have no trouble keeping and acquiring happy clients. 

3) What if I wanted to buy a stock?

You donâ€™t want an old school stock picking broker who hasnâ€™t kept up with the times. The evidence is clear that index funds are better than most mutual funds and picking stocks. The advisor should reply with some form of, â€œyou can do whatever youâ€™d like with your money, but if we are going to work together I do whatâ€™s been proven to maximize your chances of success in the long term, and that means I donâ€™t pick stocks and I donâ€™t try and time the marketsâ€. This may seem harsh but if they are willing to let you do it then they have one foot in the old school and a good sign theyâ€™re not truly objective. 

* if you find yourself in some niche like government employee, doctor, dentist, retiree, employee stock options, and can find yourself a specialist who only works with these people and wonâ€™t take on others, this is ideal. Specialists are more valuable in finance for the same reason you want someone who does hips all day to replace yours as opposed to a general orthopedist.

Hello,

I may have screwed myself over and may need your help. I work in healthcare and have a main job but I also have a lot of per diem jobs I pick up on the side. (I know I'm going to regret this because I will be waiting for 5 W2's this upcoming January).

My main job will be well over six figures with the appropriate federal and state tax withholding. However, my other pay stubs, because they're small, doesn't reflect the correct amount of federal or state tax withholding (they're sometimes a couple of dollars).

What can I do now that I'm close to the end of the year to ensure that I don't owe money? Should I just quit my side jobs in total?

I recently discovered the Treasury Direct Treasury Hunt.

I found that there are matured bonds in my name that I requested more info on about 3 months ago. I am told it takes 6 months for them to get back to you. These bonds are likely paper bonds from my grandma on my mom's side that we have no record of.

Anyway, I just found out my grandma on my dad's side's social security number who passed in 2013 and gave it a search to see if anything came up. It appears there are bond results for her.

If she is the sole person named on these (which is yet to be known) they would go to her heir which would be her only child, my dad.

He is in a Medicaid nursing home. Would the nursing home get the money automatically? Illinois does have a spousal rule where the spouse is allowed the house + 120k in assets. They (my mom) literally lives paycheck to paycheck.

She needs to contact Discover, a couple Synchrony brands, and a Citi account in which she only has the last 4 digits. She obviously knows all her personal info. She's still supposed to be paying on these cards but they are closed.

She needs them for a debt settlement program she's entering into. It's not a typical debt settlement program. It's actually legit. I know all about the ins and outs of it. Waiting 6 months of not paying and striking a deal and such. This company just does it for us with pro negotiators who will go through multiple calls with all 10+ creditors but they need the complete numbers. We have the money and their cut is reasonable. Trust me it's legit. All the accounts are closed anyway and have been for years.

Maybe it can keep her afloat a little bit, I don't know. You tell me. I know she would get his higher $1,8xx if he passes but that's still not enough by itself.

He is diagnosed with dementia and a lack of motivation to move and a fall that broke his hip has him permanently in a wheelchair.

Question: With the extra 50k saved, should I apply a principle payment, or put it in my brokerage account (fskax) and let it grow, thus giving me options with the money in about 20 years or so (I.e pay off home sooner, FIRE, etc)

Extra details:
We gross 132K right now, will go up to 135 starting July 1. We have no debt, 8 months of EF savings, investing 24% of gross income towards retirement between 2 pensions, 2 Roth IRAs and my 403B.

Hey everyone, happy Friday. Iâ€™ve been thinking about this for a couple of weeks now and hoping to get a discussion going about this idea I have,  partially inspired by The Money Guy show. Iâ€™m not risk adverse, but more along the lines of covering my bases â€œjust in caseâ€. 

First tier is the emergency fund (9 months) which is strictly an â€œincome replacement fundâ€ if either my wife or I lost our jobs. 2 months is in a separate bank, the rest in a HYSA. 

Second tier is having our deductibles saved up (renters, car, and earthquake, total is about 6K), currently in I Bonds but can be redeemed at any time (bought in November 2021). 

Third tier is having our max out of pocket medical expenses saved (3K for both) in the same HYSA, but different bucket. 

The emergency fund is 9 months bc weâ€™re hoping to buy a home in 2025 or 2026 and have been trying to start a family, so I know instead of being 9 months it will probably go down to 3-4 months depending on how much our expenses rise.

\-If I can open an HSA through Fidelity, would I invest the money as I do with the Roth (i.e. Target Date Funds)?

However, I have been reading more about sinking funds, and I'm a little confused by a couple of things. 

Firstly, I understand that sinking funds are for things like car repairs, annual car fees, Xmas gifts, etc. How many sinking funds should someone have? What are some of your sinking funds?  I think I get overwhelmed by seeing many different categories, and so I get anxious about funding them all. How long does it take you to get to your goal for each one?

For any homeowners, I also know you should have 1% of home value for repair or maintenance each year; if you know you will need a new roof for example, do you make that part of the yearly repair fund or a whole separate fund? How far in advance do you contribute to a sinking fund if you think you will need a new roof in a few years? I'm hoping to buy a home within 2 years and looking to be prepared for any surprises.

My fiance and I are planning on starting a family, but the baby would be on her insurance. Might need IVF at some point as we have been trying for a few years and she is a little older (38).

Edit:  I should add I go to the Chiropractor monthly, and pay $40 including the $20 co-pay. If there's any other needed information, happy to provide it. Premiums for PPO: 40/month, HSA would be $0/month.

What would be the best plan for me? I will be going to look through my budget for money I can (potentially) invest in the HSA, but with the Roth IRA and 403B income limit increases, I might want to focus on those first. I max out the Roth IRA and contribute $600/month to the 403B (no match). Focused on saving for a DP though so most of my after-retirement money goes to that. No debt of any kind.

My wife and I have an unusual situation.  

Due to a combination of factors (inheritance and receiving a lawsuit settlement) we have about $400K in *taxable* VTSAX/VTIAX funds.

Meanwhile, we did a poor job in our younger years setting aside retirement funds.  Our combined Roth 401K and Roth IRA balances total about $115K.  

We're in our late 30's now.  My intention has been to save most of the taxable $400K for retirement purposes, but I hate that it's currently in taxable accounts.

Most of this money was invested between 2017 and 2021 so there's not a ton of capital gains over this period.

I'm almost 40 years old with a 1-year old kid.  The successors we'd like to use at this point are all in my age bracket or much older.

I understand what this provision is trying to accomplish, but it seems like a nightmare for the kids inheriting the money because it stretches the successor responsibilities so far into the future, and potentially puts the assets at risk.

First, I had a HDHP from 5/31/2023 to 9/1/2023. My total contributions during this time was $1,282.40. I was on the individual plan. 

Then, now I have a HDHP starting 10/1/2023. This time on the family plan so my max contribution goes up to $7,750. There are 4 remaining pay periods for 2023 (I get paid on the 7th and the 22nd). Is this how it works or can I contribute up until tax day of 2024? 

I believe the IRS considers you eligible for the entire month as long as you were covered on the first day of the month. Prorated max contribution considered...

Given these factors, how much house should I comfortably target for? Iâ€™m pretty keen on having a roommate for awhile until my income increases significantly but itâ€™s not always a safe bet to force yourself to find a roommate you love.

wpkqs2,DexterTwerp,"Is my house hacking strategy good?

I hopefully will be house hacking starting in 2023. Please analyze my strategy and let me know if you see any flaws or risks.

**Financials**

*All the calculations are based on a $2,000 mortgage.*

Income:

Gross: $67,800 yearly $5,688 monthly $2,844 bi-weekly

Net: $52,338 yearly $4,362 monthly $2,180 bi-weekly

Projected rental income (found tenant, ready to sign lease): $10,800 yearly $900 monthly

Current debt-to-income ratio (w/ mortgage included): 41%

Current debt-to-income ratio (w/ mortgage &amp; rental income included): 36%

Emergency fund (cash reserves only, not including payment for closing costs &amp; down payment): \~$12,000

% of net income spent on housing: 46

% of gross spent on housing: 35

% of net spent on housingÂ (w/ rental income): 40

% of gross spent on housingÂ (w/rental income): 31

**Rules of Thumb**

*No more than 30% of your gross monthly income should be spent on housing:*

A $2,000 mortgage puts me at 35%, but with the rental income itâ€™s 31%.

*Your mortgage payment shouldn't put you more than 36% DTI:*

A $2,000 mortgage puts me at 41% DTI, but with rental income itâ€™s 36%.

*The 4x rule (if you spend less than 20% of your current take-home income on debt):*

I currently spend less than 5% of my income on existing debts, so the 4x rule gives me a purchase price of \~$270,000 with no HOA dues. This is currently the price target Iâ€™m aiming for. So although these calculations are based on a $2,000 mortgage from a \~$300,000 purchase price, it will more likely be a $1,800-$1,900 mortgage.

*Emergency fund for household expenses to last at least 6 months:*

Stashing away $2,500 for 6 months puts me at $15,000, but by the time I officially close and have to start paying the loan I should be around there.

**Factors to consider:**

* My girlfriend will live with me, and her income was left out of the loan approval process purposefully to ensure we do not overextend ourselves. My current thoughts are that weâ€™ll just split the mortgage from whatâ€™s left over from the other tenant. Weâ€™ll be paying around $550 each with the current calculations.
* I would need to lose my job and BOTH of my roommates in order for me to be truly swamped. In this case, I could sell my \~$20,000 car and live off my current cash reserves to give me time to find another job or sell the house.
* I shouldn't rely on this but my quoted \~5% interest rate leaves room for improvement, so I could refinance down the line and save money.
* The tenant is only signing a lease for a year, so the rental income is not guaranteed for the life of the loan but hopefully my income will increase in 2 or 3 years to a point where I can cover their portion eventually or find another tenant. 

Are there any flaws in this way of thinking? Any other rules of thumb I should use?Â

yozif4,DexterTwerp,"Job negotiating... Should I accept this new offer?

Here's the rundown.

My current job is with a very solid company. I am fully remote. They offer a retirement benefit of 10% (no match required, fully vested instantly), we work 7.5 hour workdays, admin staff is talking about adding amazing flexibilities like random 'wellness' days, I love my team, and I am very independent which I like, very flexible work schedules, 30 total days of leave (sick, vacation, and bereavement). My salary is currently around $68,000, but we do market research every year to make sure we are keeping up with inflation. Last year it was an 18% increase. That was for being within the top 60% of our industry. This year we are doing top 70% of the industry, but I do not expect it to be as high as 18%. I expect the 5-10% range starting Jan. 1st. I also recently got promoted, so I wouldn't be eligible for another raise for at least another two years.

The new job just offered me $80,000. They have a Cash Balance Retirement account where the company contributes 4 percent of your annual pay and bonus but this doesn't vest until 3 years of service. For the 401k, they match â€œdollar for dollarâ€ up to the first 3 percent you contribute. They then match 50 cents on the dollar for the next 2 percent. You are immediately vested and are free to take the company match with you if you decide to leave the company (no waiting period). Four and a half weeks of leave plus 5 days of bereavement. It would be a hybrid model (I could probably negotiate a remote role) coming into the office once in awhile on Mondays. I live 5 mins from the office. They give a $50 stipend every month for Internet, gym membership, or anything that I could use. There's probably more benefits but those are the most important ones to me.

They seem THRILLED to have me. What should my negotiation tactic be? They realize I am content in my current role. I have another offer on the line and they know it. I am not accepting that offer, but it's good they feel a little threatened. Should I shoot for the stars and have them meet in the middle? What's the plan here?",,,,,

24, just moved back in with my parents after living in an apartment for a year with my now ex-girlfriend. Currently paying $300/month rent to my parents. I make $90k/year, and have $90k in student loans. $10,000 in savings at the moment.

Originally my plan was to live at home for a few months to get my life figured out and then find a new apartment. But I hate the feeling of throwing rent away...in my area, a nice apartment is $1700+ for a 1 bedroom. It would take me ages to save for a house (and the current fad of paying over asking price and waiving inspection scares me) but a condo seems more doable. The only thing scaring me off is the average $400-500+ HOA fees all around my area.

I was in a rehab facility January and February last year after surgery.  I would say every other person in the facility was medicaid/medicare.  More on that in a second.

Thanksgiving week I received a bill that the facility hand wrote my forward to address on from a pharmacy out of state.  It was literally an invoice with my name on it, a due date back in August, and a bottom line amount due for a few hundred dollars.  Not a single indication of what the bill was for, when, etc.  I called the 800 number and they told me they would reprint the bill and send it to me.  I gave them my correct address.  The week after Christmas, I got another hand written forward of the exact same bill.  No changes, no updates, except the bill now said 'past due'.

The Monday after New Years, I received another letter, to the correct address from a collection agency saying I had a bill that was being collected on because I failed to pay it in August.  The only associated number was the same one I called before.  They tell you to press '6', then '1', etc, and you get a prompt that indicates you want to pay a on a collection notice.  Since it's the same number, and they have a menu prompt, this can't be an uncommon thing for them.

I got through to a representative, and explained they had been sending bills to the wrong place, I wasn't getting those bills, and when I did, there is no information in the bill as to what it was for.  The rep said they saw I had called to get a reprint, but that I refused to pay the bill.  I asked them if they could send me the actual invoice that i was supposedly missing, and they told me it looked like it was for 2 bills, one back in December of '21 for a partial Medicare copay.  I explained to them I am not on medicare (I still work and have private insurance), and I wasn't in the facility in December.

I asked them to send me an updated invoice to my email, that I think they have some mistakes on the bill, and to ask the collection agency to back down.  I also asked for a reference number for the call so when I called back i would have a case already opened.  She said I just needed to use my 'account id'.

It's been over a week, and I still haven't heard back from them.  What steps do I take next?  I feel I've done my best to figure this out.  It already seems a little shady, so I am not going to keep investing time into digging into this.  At what point will they start putting liens against me or ruining my credit?

Recently been given a medical diagnosis that might leave me unemployed and disabled in 2-3 years. I wont need intensive care, bur without getting into details I wonâ€™t be able to do many job functions (so still could find a job of some kindâ€¦ but not counting on it).

Wife and I (both age 31) a combined income of 200k (120k for me 80k for her) my wife will be at 100k in a few years, so that could be the sole income.  But if I am unable to work at age 32-33 I need to have a good system set up of security.

We have been very financially smart,  but worried about me not being able to bring money in here soon. Here is our set up.


* to start our full net worth is around 730 which is in:
* 25k Savings (was for new house and emergency fund)
* 22K I bonds (was for newhouse and emergency fund)
* 6K HSA
* 100K non retirement brokerage
* 106k roth (with 66K I could technically pull of contributions)
* 50K in 401K
*We have a house that is valued at 400k and we have 3 years to pay it off 
(at 3k a month. we are going 1k over our mortgage but once I got my medical issues I wanted this as a peace of mindâ€¦ sort of so we wouldnâ€™t have to worry about our largest expense. I know this is against popular logic but this is important to meâ€¦ to be able to feel like I took care of the biggest expense while I had my job and health)


**So my real question isâ€¦ where should I be putting any extra money? Through out the next few years ill have 1-1.5K a month potentially I could put in places like Roth, HSA, and non tax brokerage account.**

 I am confident in my wifeâ€™s role so we will have income coming in (100k) and we will have our house paid off right around the time I wonâ€™t be able to workâ€¦. But if I am maxing out my roth (6k), HAS (3.5k) and 401K (30.5k after company match a year) for another 2 years, that still puts us in a great position. 

I realize while not idealâ€¦I have near 160ishK of accessible money for some horrible double loss of employment or something. That includes roth and some avenues not ideal for early use. 

But outside of keep on keeping on this pathâ€¦ what should I be doing with extra money I want to be accessible once I get out of work, the non-retirement brokerage? Bonds? High yield savings account? Any advice welcomed.

**Alsoâ€¦. The last year with my medical diagnosis has left me depressed and suicidalâ€¦ seeing a therapist has literally saved my life and gave me a positive outlook. I encourage anyone to do so if struggling.**

**I fully realize that outside of my health I am blessed with an amazing wife who is gonna help me out as well as a very strong financial start to everything. So i hope the numbers dont come off as a humble brag**

EDIT:I also wanted to add.... my biggest regret is not doing disability insurance.

ohmrj0,dipcupdipcup,"Plan to aggressively pay off condo (2.3 years), save for downpayment on house (need 50K more), and modestly invest (6K a year Roth)

Recently married in the US, and we have a net worth of $292k (see break down). We are both 29 years old. We have a small combined monthly income (7.2k) and make a combined 80k after taxes. Both of our jobs don't really offer any retirement account or benefits, so we just fund a roth yearly ourselves.

Due to a generous gift as well as a unique family situation, we are planning to pay off the condo we live in, in 2.3 years. This needs to be done time wise for a family situation far too complicated to explain. To do this, we are paying 4K a month (for the next 2.3 years). The idea is to pay it off in the 2.3 years, any leftover money save up for a down payment for a new house (try to get about 100k, so we are halfway there with 50k savings), and then because of that aggressive strategy, just barely fund our roths (6K each). If we aren't able to save another 50K, after we pay off the condo, we will aggressively save for another year or two since we will own the condo and no mortgage payments. 

The grand idea... is rent out the condo (for 1.5-2k a month) and then use that to pay most of the monthly mortgage on a large house (20-30 year mortgage). Thus, since that is paying off most of the mortgage, our salaries will feel much larger than they are (used for investments, savings, set). 

The downside of this plan, is that we are neglecting our retirement accounts a bit for the next few years, as we might have to dip into savings/the down payment fund to get that 6k a year each. We kinda decide paying off the house and viewing that as our investment for the next few years is our goal.

I wanted to run this plan by here to see peoples thoughts. We have to pay the condo this way. Is focusing on this and the downpayment better then investing for a few years? Should we hold off on the downpayment and make the Roth a priority for the 2-3 years? Funding the roth for 2-3 years is 24-36K that could be for the downpayment. Or is it best to save and do roth and once the condo is payed then aggressively save.

I really like the idea of Roth since I know exactly how much I have and donâ€™t need to worry about tax rates come withdrawal time, but I donâ€™t want to let personal preference get in the way of the better financial decision, especially since my marginal tax rate is so high. I (22M) live in CA and am making ~70k/yr which puts me at a 31.3% marginal tax rate: 22% federal + 9.3% CA (though only a ~21% effective tax rate). 

Iâ€™m unsure whether I should choose traditional or Roth for my 401(k). I figure a pro for Roth is that Iâ€™m starting young and plan to contribute ~20% to retirement annually, which should give me a higher retirement income on distributions alone, plus I expect the U.S. to have higher taxes in the future. However, saving 31.3% on taxes right now is a big pro for traditional, and if I end up retiring in a low tax state then it would almost certainly have been the move.

One option Iâ€™m considering is starting out with Roth then jumping to traditional when I start earning more. I expect to be promoted and making $85k/yr in 3 years, so I could do 3 years of Roth 401k contributions then traditional indefinitely after the pay jump.

kczrha,disgruntIed_giraffe,"Basic Investing Advice to get you started.

I wrote this out for a friend, thought it might be helpful to share here too. The goal is to provide some context for beginners and show how to get started. Iâ€™m open to questions from anyone trying to learn, or critiques from the veterans.

First off the rule of thumb is to only have your emergency fund and expected upcoming expenses in cash, everything else should be invested. Think about how much cash you need, and in the meantime you can start small by investing a little bit each month and increasing your contributions as you get more comfortable. For how you should be investing, Iâ€™m going to recommend putting everything into a Total Stock Market Index Fund.
 
A Total Market Index Fund tracks the performance of the entire US stock market. The way it works is it has almost 3,700 different stocks in it, each weighted based on their total value in the stock market. For example Apple is the biggest company in the US by market value, worth 6.5% of the entire stock market. Microsoft is the next biggest at 5%. So if you have $100,000 invested in a Total Market Index Fund, itâ€™s like you actually have $6,500 invested in Apple, $5,000 in Microsoft, and so on based on each of the 3,700 stocks weighted values.
 
The S&amp;P 500 is another popular index fund. It is comprised of the 500 biggest companies in the US and makes up over 2/3 of the total stock market, so it has a lot of overlap with the Total Stock Market Index Fund, but it has a little less exposure since it excludes the smaller companies. Historically the performances of these two indexes have been nearly identical.
 
The S&amp;P 500 and Total Stock Market have had over 13% annual growth over the last 10 years, so in that timeframe $100,000 invested wouldâ€™ve grown to ~$370,000, which is a great example of how powerful investing is over sitting on cash, but itâ€™s also important to note that past performance does not guarantee future performance. These last 10 years have had particularly strong growth, and Iâ€™d be surprised if it keeps that pace.
 
The Total Stock Market fund and S&amp;P 500 fund are both synonymous with â€œthe Market,â€ and are two examples of low-cost, passively invested index funds. Index funds seek market average returns, but there are thousands of actively managed mutual funds to choose from which are more expensive and exist on the belief that theyâ€™ll â€œbeat the Market.â€ Some do, but in reality most end up underperforming, which is why Iâ€™m recommending a cheap and easy index fund.
 
You can find these funds at any of the big investment firms: choose from either Fidelity, Vanguard, or Charles Schwab. To use Fidelityâ€™s Total Stock Market Index Fund, FSKAX, thereâ€™s no minimum investment, and the fee is only 0.015%, so every $1,000 you have invested will cost you 15 cents each year. Good practice for investing is to consistently contribute every month, as much as you can afford. You can do things like set up direct deposit to have a portion of your paycheck go straight to your investments, or automatically transfer some amount from your bank like $500 every month, or just contribute each month based on how much you have available. They have good customer service that will help you get setup.  
 
Note on the power of compounding interest: Historically the market has averaged 10% annual returns. At that rate of growth, if you were to invest $1,000/mo for 40 years, you would end up with over 5 million dollars, having contributed a total of $480,000. $500/mo would get you over 2.5 million dollars from $240,000 in total contributions.

Afterthought: Investing is much easier than most think, you just need to find the right fund(s) and contribute monthly, can even set that up automatically. It does get slightly more complex as you get older and as you accumulate more wealth. Once you cross a certain threshold of wealth, and Iâ€™m talking $200,000+ invested, itâ€™d be a good idea to get more diversified. And as you get closer to retirement, youâ€™ll want to invest more conservatively. But both of those are just a matter of adding a couple more funds to your portfolio and choosing how much you want in each one.

kt7mt4,disgruntIed_giraffe,"22M living in California, should I go with Roth or Traditional 401(k)?

There are a few factors to consider and I could use some perspective or opinions on sorting it out. Note that regardless of my 401(k) decision, I plan on opening a Roth IRA and maxing that out annually until retirement.

1. Income: My income is ~$70k and I expect to have a lot more in retirement after 40 years of steady contributions. However because of CA taxes, $70k means Iâ€™m already in the 31.3% tax bracket (22% federal + 9.3% CA). Based on todayâ€™s tax rates, my income would have to be a whole lot higher for my future effective tax rate to be more than 31.3%, especially since Iâ€™ll likely be married. [Higher income in retirement is a pro for Roth, though itâ€™s hard to swallow paying 31.3% today thinking itâ€™d be even more in the future]

2. Location: Living in CA puts me in a very high income tax state, and who knows if Iâ€™ll end up here, or somewhere with lower taxes. It would be nice to stay in CA but anything can happen over these next 40 years. [pro for Traditional since I could only end up in an equal or a lower income tax state]

3. Future tax rates: With relatively low tax rates today and the current state of debt, itâ€™s hard to imagine taxes wonâ€™t be significantly higher 40 years from now. I feel a little risk averse on the fear of doing traditional then getting slammed by taxes in retirement. [pro for Roth because expecting future rates to be higher]

4. Pension: I have a small pension plan at my company. Nothing major but it would definitely serve to raise my retirement income. But unless I stay at this company this point is not applicable. [pro for Roth because higher retirement income if I stay with company]

5. Roth reliability: I think itâ€™s less likely but worth noting the possibility of the government finding ways to tax Roth in the future, whether itâ€™s wealth tax, sales tax, or just diminished Roth benefits. [pro for Traditional]",,,,,
mm42vv,disgruntIed_giraffe,"Looking to buy an apartment for my twenties, then eventually upgrade to a house. Rather than selling the apartment for cash for the next down payment, would it be ideal if feasible to keep apartment as a rental property?

I know a lot goes into that question in terms of the investment value of the specific property, but Iâ€™m just looking for insight on this strategy as a way to broaden my portfolio. If I can save up for the second down payment without needing to sell the apartment, and if I can find renters that will cover the apartmentâ€™s mortgage after moving out, then Iâ€™ll eventually come out owning the apartment and can earn rental income or cash out if needed. My primary and only source of investing right now is saving 15-20% of my income via IRA and 401k, and Iâ€™ll continue to do that until I retire. Iâ€™m thinking anything above that 15-20% could go toward maintaining this property, rather than toward increasing retirement contributions. 

I know I need to be prepared to handle both my apartment mortgage and home mortgage in times when renters fall out, plus plenty of maintenance costs to consider. But assuming Iâ€™m in a good enough financial position to handle those (steady income, big emergency fund), should I make it a goal to pursue this option? If so then when I do buy the apartment that Iâ€™ll live in, Iâ€™ll also have to consider its investment potential rather than just is it a good/affordable place to live.

I like this option because it would increase my portfolio beyond just my 401k and IRA, and I see this as the only way Iâ€™d be able to get into real estate investing, as I donâ€™t want to outright buy a rental property, but soon Iâ€™ll have to buy a place to live, so after a few years I will have some equity in it and be able to make a more informed decision on keeping that property as an investment.",,,,,
nadmbs,disgruntIed_giraffe,"To pay off or not to pay off debt...

Looking for some friendly â€œWhat Would You Doâ€™sâ€ in my situation. 

I (23M) have close to $30k in student loan debt and am otherwise debt free. The average interest rate is 4.5% with loans ranging from 4 to 5.5%. I have a full emergency fund, save approximately 15-20% of my paycheck in retirement accounts, and save about ~$2k a month in cash that I have not yet determined how to use. The excess cash could go toward: 
* Paying off debt quickly
* Saving for a downpayment on a home (not urgent but I want to be ready to do this in the next few years)
* Increasing retirement contributions

Thinking my main two options are as follows:
1. Put that $2k/mo entirely toward student loans, have them paid off by summer of 2022, then start saving for a house while seeing if thereâ€™s extra room in the budget to increase retirement contributions
2. Make the minimum monthly payments over the life of the loan while prioritizing increasing retirement contributions and start saving for a down payment when necessary. 

The emotional component is in favor of option #1 as I think it would feel great to not have to worry about debt anymore, but I know the loan interest isnâ€™t that high especially since Iâ€™m young, so looking strictly at the math Iâ€™m likely better off investing (though I do think this might be slightly offset by the seemingly increased risk of market uncertainty at this time).

qkpf0y,disgruntIed_giraffe,"Downsides to using my Roth 401k instead of standard Brokerage Account for a 5-10 year investment life?

Background - Iâ€™m 24 with an 80K income in a HCOL area. Iâ€™m contributing 20% of my income toward retirement between a Roth IRA and Roth 401K (might switch to traditional 401K in the coming years but doing Roth for now), which equates to 6K to the IRA and 10K to the 401K, so I still have 9.5K of unused Roth 401K contributions. I donâ€™t want to increase retirement contributions beyond 20% because I feel thatâ€™s a good baseline and that I should prioritize saving for the likelihood of needing a downpayment on a home in the next 5-10 years.

Question - Since my timeline for a downpayment is 5-10 years, I figure I should be investing that money rather than holding it all in cash. Rather than using a taxable brokerage account, would it make sense to save for a down payment via increasing my Roth 401k contributions, with the intention of withdrawing that money in 5-10 years, since thereâ€™s a penalty free early withdrawal exception for first-time homebuyers? If that exception includes the non taxable Roth growth (correct me if it doesnâ€™t), then essentially I can invest without capital gains tax up until reaching my Roth 401K limit, and the downside of not being able to withdraw until age 59.5 is eliminated since this falls under one of the early withdraw exceptions.

rfk1yb,disgruntIed_giraffe,"Does high inflation incentivize holding onto debt?

I have 30K student loan debt with 4.5% interest, and Iâ€™ve always used that 4.5% number as the basis for my internal pay off debt v invest argument, i.e. pay off debt for the security of being debt free and receive a guaranteed 4.5% rate of return, or invest hoping for better returns. 

Now with inflation on the rise, it devalues the amount of debt I have and offsets the interest I owe. Iâ€™m salaried and receive annual inflation-based raises, so letâ€™s assume next year I get a 4.5% inflation raise applied to my salary, that would loosely translate to my loan being interest free in terms of real dollars right?

So now the debate becomes pay off debt for the security of being debt free or invest hoping for better returns, except now the returns just have to beat inflation or it to be net positive. Does my logic here make sense?

Edit: after reading comments I think I can more accurately summarize my viewpoints
* Inflation offsets interest on debt in terms of real dollars
* Assuming 4.5% inflation, the real value of my debt remains the same, but the nominal dollars increases which still affects me, but THIS is offset if I get the 4.5% inflation raise
* Due to the above two points, in the debate of Debt v Investing: interest rate on my debt is no longer a factor in the equation, and if I choose investing, I just need to outpace inflation for a net positive.",,,,,
wpfapm,disgruntIed_giraffe,"How to calculate personal savings rate when saving before and after tax dollars?

I know Iâ€™m splitting hairs here, but it helps me with tracking and goal setting.

Hypothetical $100k gross salary and 75k net salary. Annual savings is 10k pre-tax to 401k and 6k after-tax to Roth IRA. So what is my savings rate? Seems incorrect to combine pre-tax/after-tax and say Iâ€™m saving 16k per year, which could equate to a 16% savings rate or 21% depending on whether Iâ€™m dividing by gross or net income.

I figure the simplest and most accurate formula is to do pre-tax savings/gross income + after-tax savings/net income as follows:
* 10k pre-tax / 100k gross income = 10% savings rate
* 6k Roth / 75k net income = 8% savings rate 
* Total savings rate = 10% + 8% = 18%

Does that formula make sense? What else should I consider? While I understand itâ€™s somewhat arbitrary and Iâ€™m probably close enough, Iâ€™m happy to get granular if you are.",,,,,

I quite stupidly took out a student loan at 8.5% 12 years ago from my credit union, and now that I have graduated (PhD) my payments are resuming in 6 months.

Hey guys,

I'm in a rough financial predicament right now. I'm a 28-year-old graduate student making $35k/yr, in my last year. In &lt;6 months, I will graduate with my PhD (physics, from an Ivy) and will make approximately 100k. I do not yet have an offer, but I have enough connections in industry that for all intents and purposes, this is guaranteed.

However, my rent just went up by $500/month. When I moved in seven years ago, I paid $1000/month, it went up to $1500/month over the past seven years, and is now $2000. 

My plan was to graduate this May, in which case I would not have had to sign a new lease. However, as my mom passed away and I had to take time off to play home hospice nurse for a few months, I am now graduating in the fall.

As a result, I am chewing through my savings. I will also need to move after I graduate, as I live in the middle of nowhere and my PhD focus is very niche. I am planning on taking out an unsecured personal loan out for first+last+security when I move, as most jobs are in the Boston area where first+last+security will run 8k easily.

My assets/debts are as follows:

* Undergrad student loans: $20k (payment not required until after graduation)
* Monthly expenses: $730
* Vehicles: Both owned outright, car worth $2k motorcycle worth $500
* Emergency fund: $1k
* Investment accounts: $4k
* Roth IRA: $4k


I paid off about $10k of student loans while in grad school, despite not being required to pay, just because I hated seeing the interest rack up. I also put a measly amount of money into an IRA, both of which were kind of stupid as I chewed through my savings so quickly once my rent went up.

Honestly, I am so stressed right now. My rent is $2k per month now, and I get paid $2.4k monthly. I cannot move without paying a $2k fine to cut the lease, and even if I could, finding somewhere that will take two cats is difficult, and I will pay another $1-2k just for a security deposit.

voeetu,DishsoapOnASponge,"Sell my car now, later, or keep and repair?

I have a 2007 Camry with 180k miles on it. It's worth about 3k. I just dumped 3k into it (over several months) to repair some things - catalytic converter, transmission repair, new brakes. 

In six months, I'll wrap up grad school and move to another state with inspections. I recently took my car to a mechanic in that state and while there for repairs, got a quote for bringing the car up to speed to pass inspection. The e-brake and ABS do not work in my car and a few emissions issues, altogether about $3k for it to pass inspection.

My problem is this. I'm in my last semester of grad school (PhD) and my rent just went up by over 30%. I don't have the cash on hand if I have another major car repair. I will have no issue getting a job, and also have an offer for one which I consider a backup job. 

My options are as follows:

1. Sell my car now, use the money to make monthly payments to buy or lease a car, put $0 down. 
2. Risk another car repair, which will either put me underwater or leave me car-less. Sell and buy a car in ~6 mo when I move and need to have the car inspected.
3. Keep the car indefinitely, use money from new job to bring the car up to inspection-worthy.

I'm pretty clueless on this stuff, in my mind it is best to just keep on keeping on, and continue driving my current car until I move and get a job. Thoughts?",,,,,
yzhj44,DishsoapOnASponge,"I am having issues obtaining a personal loan and am not understanding why, can someone help?

I am 29, and in my last year of a reputable PhD program in physics. I have a stipend, but it's not much (high 20s, and I pay 1.3k/mo in rent...). I also have student loans from undergrad, about 30k. Really just pinching pennies here trying to make it to graduation.

I have had credit cards since I was 18. I pay them off each month, and have never missed a payment. My credit score is in the upper 700s. 

Recently, I received a job offer in a major metropolitan area. It pays about 6x what I currently make. I need to move, but cannot afford to. Relocation assistance is not offered through this position.

I went to my credit union where I have been a customer since age 12 (with a kiddo account). I asked for a personal loan for moving expenses and first/last month's rent in my new place (totals about 10k). I showed them my job offer, and detailed what I would spend the money on. I made clear my history with the credit union (I keep my savings there, and use the checking account regularly). 

I was denied, on the basis that I was asking for a 10k loan on technically a salary less than 30k. Makes sense.

I simply do not know how to move forward - if my own credit union will not loan me this money, I do not know who will without charging exorbitant interest rates. 

Is my current income truly the only consideration when making decisions about personal loans? This is quite ridiculous. I cannot stay in my current area as there are no jobs here - are highly employable graduate students really expected to take a less-than-desirable job in a LCOL area just because they cannot afford to move?

I do not have friends or family to loan me money, as even with my measly grad student stipend I make more than my parents lol.

EDIT: Some have suggested an extended stay hotel, but I have two cats, one of which is special needs. I do not have family that I trust to take care of them (a previous cat was once put down without permission by my only family with the space) and my friends do not have the space/willingness as they are mostly grad students too. I know I am being picky but I will not give them up or have them somewhere where their health will suffer.

EDIT: I've gotten some very helpful suggestions, thanks so much guys! I've requested a credit line increase, gotten some ideas for where else to apply for loans, and will also look for apartments where I can just live in a room month-to-month that allows my cats. Thanks!!",,,,,
zyhogm,DishsoapOnASponge,"Salary increasing by 300% but also moving to HCOL... wondering if I'm missing anything in my budget.

Hey there!

I am a PhD student (F29) making 40k gross right now, with $1600 monthly rent/utilities expenses. I also spend about $1k/mo for everything else.

I just got a job at a startup in an HCOL area (Boston, MA). There are a lot of things I've never had to worry about before (student loans, retirement plans, health insurance) and I'd love a second (third, fourth... thousandth...) set of eyes.

My gross income will be 130k. From online calculators, it seems like I will lose about 34k to taxes so 96k net, a nice round $8k/mo take home pay.

**8k take home**

From this, I will take $6k and put into a separate account so that I will never see it. I will pay:

**$500 - student loans** I have about $28k (before any forgiveness) at 4%. I think making the minimum payments here makes sense, as I earn more in the market.

**$500 - Roth IRA** I have a target date fund through Schwab. This will max out my Roth IRA contributions for the year as I understand. Since my job is at a startup, there are no retirement plans or anything.

**$500 - HDHP premium and HSA contribution**. I don't know exactly what health plans are offered by my employer as I don't start formally until February, but if it's an option I'd prefer an HDHP with an HSA. If I can, I'll put $300/mo away in the HSA to max it out. Otherwise this will just be my premium. I'm a healthy single person so don't have much need for a low-deductible plan.

**$3500 - rent/utilities** No way to get around this one, I'm afraid. I've signed the lease and set up utilities. Might go down in the future but not planning on it right now.

**$150 - car/renters insurance combo** 

**$850 - non-tax-advantaged investment account** This will be my emergency fund. I rent and won't need a car for commuting, so I'm okay with this being in the market. Also will help with a car downpayment in the future, or a house downpayment in the far far far far future. At first, this will actually go toward paying off a loan I took out to move - I get a signing bonus which covered a lot, but not everything...

That is the 6k that I won't ever look at. I will then have 2k for spending money:

**$300 - savings account** For things like vacations, gifts, random shit.

**$800 - groceries/restaurant** This is about 20% above what I spend now when I'm lazy about budgeting, allowing a bit of lifestyle inflation (and HCOL inflation...)

**$200 - clothing** I know this sounds ridiculous. My clothes are falling apart, and as a grad student lab rat I've spent most of my days in comfy informal clothing.

**$700 - misc** Vet bills. Cat food. Vehicle fuel. Random shit. Honestly I find that everything that isn't food totally racks up without even thinking about it. 


--------------------------------------------

I designed this budget based off stuff I've learned from this subreddit and the helpful stuff in the sidebar. 

Am I missing anything? I really don't want to be surprised, and this move/shift in lifestyle is really terrifying to me, as I am independent and don't really know what to expect.

11drqxr,DoctorQuinlan,"[Auto] Would it be better to wait to buy an SUV with all cash (or with a car loan)?

I really need to get my own vehicle soon, but for now am borrowing a relative's. I pay them, but would like to be independent. I have a good amount of cash saved up to buy my own SUV. Looking mostly at used Toyota Rav4's or Subaru Forrester's (but willing to consider any comparable SUV that has a good reputation and is on the cheaper end - Toyotas, Hondas, Hyundais, etc.). 

Where things get complicated....I think...

1. Market seems not great now for buying used cars. Prices seem high from what I've heard

2. This would be my first vehicle I bought on my own (ie without parents)

3. Interest rates are high (not a problem if I use cash, but I also wonder if saving cash and investing it would benefit me more - maybe not worth the risk if its 5% +)

4. I could technically use my relative's car longer, but then they (potentially) lose out on the opportunity cost of selling their car sooner

5. I am also looking for a house to buy asap as well

6. I can also buy the vehicle under a family/my LLC I think

7. If I do a loan, would it make sense in today's market? And how does one go about finding a good loan or dealership that offers rebates (just learned this is sometimes a thing)?

Iâ€™ve never had a brokerage account, always did Roth IRA and traditional 401k which are easy when it comes to income taxes. 

I have read that with a brokerage you have to claim/pay tax on gains for that year even if you donâ€™t take the money out (lame).

So, if Iâ€™m using todayâ€™s example of a couple that makes 100k and files jointly and has a standard deduction of 27k = 73k taxable income. 12% marginal tax rate (12% rate up to 83k).

Letâ€™s say you invest 10k and make 2k by the end of the year, for easy math sake. Is that 2k taxed as income, making your taxable income 75k instead of 73? Also, I know it can get tricky year over year with how much of the gains are on money you put in vs gains/ especially if you do DCAâ€¦does a form come in yrly that explains those gains that you can use on your form or is it up to you to determine what is taxed?

It just seems odd so many people say to act like you'll get nothing, but those same people say ""oh of the market doesn't go up in a few decades > now, then we have bigger things to worry about"", isn't that the same case with SS being gone?_x000D_

Reason I ask is when I see ""1m in today's dollars isn't enough to retire""...to me, at least, thinking about having 1m in retirement for my wife and I and having a paid off house, seems fine. If I retire at 65 with 1m in 401k and start taking out my SS + wifes (estimates in todays dollars) of \~55k a year there + SWR of even 35k to be safe...that gives us 90k a year to take out with low taxable income and no FICA taxes leaves us with over 80k to spend, we don't even spend that now!_x000D_

I know a Roth IRA should be used for retirement, get that. I know people use taxable account for different reasons, get that.

The way I see it is if I am 30 and do 7k a year to a Roth at 45 I have 105k of TAX FREE contributions I could take out of my Roth IRA at any point vs had it been in a brokerage paying 15% on that money. I know the other (gains) on the Roth cannot be taken out so perhaps thatâ€™s the situation itâ€™s better but I would imagine for a lot of people the Ira is a better option especially those with a more traditional life whoâ€™s kids start going to college/get married when the parent is 50â€¦you could have close to 300k between you and your spouse of money you could pull out for things like that and pay 0 tax on it vs paying if you had to take it out of a taxable brokerage assuming youâ€™re still working and making a good salary.

pfs00v,DoeJumars,"Early Retirement question

Big IF, but if I can continue to max out my 401k and ROTH and retire with a few hundred k in cash (parents leave behind, general savings) and have ~500k in Roth savings thatâ€™s close to a mill of non taxable income/savings which could bridge the gap for a guy who wants to retire early and not be left with no medical care, no? Like theoretically if I had enough cash to live 55-59.5 and used that all up, then at 59.5 I cash out my Roth and live off that until 65 (when I can get government insurance and then tap into 401k) I could be covered from 55-65, right? If my taxable income is low enough I can get Medicaid even if I have the assets, long as itâ€™s all tax free savings Iâ€™m plucking from?

A couple things, Iâ€™m still a what are you doing away (33 now) from retirement So right now I have my 401(k) from work through Transamerica and I am invested in a total stock fund through Vanguard on the site that is all stocks so being a little bit more aggressive which is helped me out over the last few years because the market has been so hot. Iâ€™ve been thinking a bit about retirement this week and just for shits and giggles I went on and looked at the different allocation options I have to the fund and looked at the target date retirement fund for 2025 and on the breakdown of it and noticed that it is 50% stocks (32% US, 18% international), 37% cash, 5% bonds and 8% otherâ€¦

1. The stock allocation seemed a bit high, but the more alarming part was I always thought the bond allocation would be closer to what the cash allocation is? Is this kinda the rule of thumb/is there one and does the % keep swaying in the cash direction a few % points the older you get? Basically wondering what the standard is with this at/close to retirement then through the remainder of retirement.

2. Transamerica Lifegoal 2025 with Blackrock Ret Acct is the one I looked at, they have a different one for every 5 year increment until 2026â€¦what happens with the people who are in this (2025) one when 2025 passes and it drops off the list of available allocations on the Transamerica website?

pms0o2,DoeJumars,"Taxes now vs the future

Taxation in Retirement vs Now

Someone help me understand the difference between taxes and retirement versus now (broad level).

I get a standard deduction and now, Iâ€™m married filing joint. 93k a year, max 401k and 5k in HSA. So that should be ~69k AGI, then 25k standard deduction puts us at 44k taxable income. 12% bracket but an effective tax rate of like 6% federally if my math is correct?

Letâ€™s say when I retire and I push off my SS benefits until Iâ€™m 70, it says on the SS site that my wife and I could get 79k a year (3316/mo)..if I couple that with say a RMD on my 401k of 60k. Iâ€™m at 149k, but I donâ€™t know how the SS money plays into that, is it half of it thatâ€™s taxed? So 70k + (.5 SS) 40 for a total of 111k AGI?

â€¦so confused, reason Iâ€™m looking at it is to figure out if I need to start contributing to my Roth instead of my Traditional 401k. 33 with 160k in traditional, if I keep maxing it out Iâ€™m going to have RMDs that are higher than what I make now lol",,,,,

MAX OUT YOUR HSA (if you have one).

Since I started out of college (debt free luckily) I have been pretty much contributing to my 401k at least a bit, maxing out last few yearsâ€¦.all fine and dandy. Now Iâ€™m making some good $ and thinking I can keep maxing it then I get more interested in retirement so I do reading instead of putting my head down and maxing my 401k and not thinking twice and just letting this hsa account sit thereâ€¦

Your HSA account (after 65) works EXACTLY like your 401k does, but betterâ€¦no required distribution minimums so you arent left trying to figure out how much to take out to stay in a low tax bracket, you can use the balances in the account to pay medical expenses ANY TIME YOU WANT, then if youâ€™re lucky enough to pay medical expenses out of pocket you can go in and reimburse yourself for decades worth of medical expenses.

Hey all,

Lets assume rules and brackets are like they are today, these numbers are my assumptions in 26 years for myself.

**..I am 60, MFJ and retired.**

&amp;#x200B;

* **1.5m** in 401k that I just rolled over to a **Roth IRA (70/30 split stocks/bonds)**
* **900k** (445 in mine, 445 in my wifes- who I contribute to via the spousal Roth since she doesn't work)  **Roth IRA (100% SP 500)**
* **250k in HSA (100% SP 500**

&amp;#x200B;

*...kid(s) are in college/finishing up, I have a 529 setup for them which should cover costs or at least a good chunk of them, so assume they're good there.*

*My wife and I can live off 65k a year. House paid off, if anything we could downsize. This lets us live life, enjoy some vaca's, etc.*

**My question is, what order should I do things? In my mind:**

1. Take out \~85k in IRA money a year which after taxes gives me that 65k I need to live life from age 60-70 or as long as I can (*put off SS until 70*).
2. I have \~25k left that I can roll over from my IRA to Roth and pay minimal taxes on to fill the 12% bracket (MFJ) and let that grow tax free for later via a conversion/ladder whatever you want to call it, Repeat step 1-2 as long as I can until the well runs dry. *All the while my Roth IRA and HSA keep growing, I use the HSA to pay any big medical expense but hoping they wont be that crazy.*
3. My IRA gets milked dry eventually because I am taking out close to 6% a year plus the \~25k I am rolling over which is basically 8%, twice the recommended amount...but instead of doing me 30 years it will do me \~15 which is probably more than I really need since SS is about to hit at 70 for wife and I. 
4. Now I am 70, have put off SS long enough. I don't have much left in the IRA so I can use that to fill lower tax brackets, wife and I are combined supposed to get 59k a year in SS by now which probably will only be taxed at 50% because I am using only \~30k in IRA a year to fill the lower brackets. I still roll over the excess like I have been until I am finally dry of IRA.
5. Now I have no IRA but my Roths have been growing forever, same with HSA and we get a lot of SS. Rest of my life I can pull out anything in Roth tax free, use SS to fill lower tax brackets, HSA for health still...

1.  ""The composite rate for I bonds issued from **November 2021 through** **April 2022** is **7.12 percent**. This rate applies for the first six months you own the bond."" 
2. ""You can redeem the bond after 12 months. However, if you redeem the bond before it is five years old, you lose the last three months of interest.""

Do I understand how I-bonds work or did I miss anything? They sound like a sound investment from what I understand.",,,,,
r0ih75,Dr_Garp,"Could you buy I Bonds each year?

So the limit for owning I Bonds is 15k per calendar year (10k in electronic and 5k in paper, referenced as 1). So in theory could you have 45k in I Bonds if you purchased 15k worth each year for 3 years?

r680nd,Dr_Garp,"Is it okay to lose money on a vacation?

So I'm going home for the last week of December to see my family. It's been about 2 years now so I figured I should check on my nieces just to make sure they're okay and stuff.
Only problem is I only have 4k saved up. I wanted to use 3.3k to pay off all my unsubsidized loans, on January 30th, and then just keep saving up from there. 
If I go home I'll probably still be able to do that but I'll be in a tricky spot money wise (not too bad as in missing rent or anything but I probably won't be able to pay all of those loans at once without risking my security).

I think the entire week will end up costing me a grand (700 for hotels assuming I can't stay with anyone for the week, and maybe $200 traveling because Massachusetts is big. The extra 100 is just in case.). 
Is losing a grand worth it? I think I can make it back if I really cut my expenses but I'm not 100% sure.",,,,,
rcityx,Dr_Garp,"Building took an electricity bill early, should I be concerned?

So I usually leave a little extra money in my account for my rent just in case the building I live in has issues with accounting but I just noticed they took an electricity bill early (it's dated Jan 1st 2022). I get that's why I have money in the account but who charges a month early???
Maybe I'm just paranoid because I woke up to find Amazon charged my card without using my gift card and greyhound changed my bus schedule to an hour earlier than expected but should I contact my building? The money is out of sight, out of mind but I seriously didn't expect an electricity charge so early in the month.",,,,,
