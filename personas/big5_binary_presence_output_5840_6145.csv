yjhi8h,tadhg555,"Question about financial planners

I am looking for a financial planner to help me manage investments. I know that I want to use a fiduciary, but I am a little unclear on how the process works.

Would the CFP actually manage my funds, or would they simply provide advice on what I might do?

For example, if they recommended that I invest in a mutual fund (say Fidelity), would they do that for me, or would I need to open an account with Fidelity?

I ask because I would prefer to avoid a situation where I am getting conflicting advice (from my CFP and whomever would be assigned to my account with Fidelity). 

Just trying to make sense of how the relationship might work.",Yes,Yes,No,Yes,No
yo8wjs,tadhg555,"Confused about advisors

Following up on an earlier postâ€¦ My wife and I recently came into some money and we are looking for some professional guidance.

My inclination is toward a flat-fee fiduciary with whom we could discuss our goals and risk tolerance, and who would work with us to develop a financial plan for our investments. We would then implement the plan, and if necessary return to this person to discuss any major changes in the years to come (paying as needed for future consultations).

Hereâ€™s where I am confused: nearly every person I have spoken to who has a financial planner works with someone at a wealth management firm who handles their investments for a percentage (usually around 1% or so). 

These are very smart people whom I would trust on most any other topics, so I am surprised that they seem unconcerned about the amount they are spending.

Am I missing something? Is there a benefit to having a money manager on retainer that Iâ€™m not seeing? Do they have access to a level of investment that I wouldnâ€™t be able to get on my own (shorts, etc.)?

I canâ€™t believe that everyone I know is outperforming the market with their personal wealth managers. But maybe they are?",Yes,Yes,No,Yes,No
ywfgut,tadhg555,"Increasing payroll deductions to offset RMD?

I have a somewhat naive question about inherited IRAs and the tax impact of potential RMDs. If the tax rules change (as it appears they might) and beneficiaries again have to take yearly RMDs, I was wondering if it  makes sense to increase the amount that one contributes to a pre-tax 401k in order to offset any increase in taxable income.

For example, let's say I currently make $100,000/year and contribute 10% to my pre-tax 401k. Then let's say that my RMD for 2023 will be $10,000. If I increase my pre-tax 401k contributions to 20%, would that effectively keep my taxable income the same?

Does it work that way?",Yes,Yes,No,Yes,No
z15lnc,tadhg555,"Question about RMD for deceased parent

My mother passed away last month, and I am trying to make sense of her estate. I am going to be meeting with a financial planner and a CPA, but I wanted to see if anyone had insight into a specific issue I'm dealing with.

I understand the 10-year rule regarding any inherited IRA I receive, but I was wondering about any RMDs that my mother was responsible for before she died.

My mother did not take the 2022 RMD from her IRA, so my understanding is that her brokerage will distribute that amount to me and I will be required to pay any taxes on it based on my current tax bracket.

However, the coroner has not yet determined an official cause of death for my mother (due to issues at the hospital), and it's doubtful that I will legally be able to settle her estate and receive anything until 2023. (I am a named beneficiary for the IRA, but they need a death certificate with cause of death to finalize any transaction.)

If I can't receive my mother's 2022 RMD until next year, will I be subject to the IRS' 50% penalty, or can they forgive it given the extenuating circumstances? How do I notify the IRS about this?",Yes,Yes,No,Yes,No
hh2lc8,TaeTwoTimes,"How To Refinance Personal Loan?

So about a year ago I eagerly wanted to get one of cars over always wanted , only issue was it wasnâ€™t within the 10 year model year limit my banking institution gives out Car loans to so I had to take out a personal loan for it through them. Yes, I know I shouldâ€™ve shopped around to other banks and see who could do an actual car loan but the car probably wouldâ€™ve sold if I waited another day and I didnâ€™t have the cash at that time. So my question is , the loan is through my primary credit union. Have all my accounts through them , is it possible to refinance this loan through another bank And if so how do I go about it and when I do refinance will it effect my credit since the age of that existing open account will close Iâ€™m assuming ? Itâ€™s a crazy interest rate of about 14% on this and still owe 9k paying around 305 a month and only about a little over half of that goes to the actual principal ,initially I didnâ€™t care due to the excitement of the car but now I realize it was foolish. Iâ€™m 21 have about 20k put away and  have a good job. I can pay this off and it wouldnâ€™t really effect me but I like keeping liquid capital to play around and invest with.

f1i7bl,Teddyworks,"Yearly retirement portfolio check-up

Didnâ€™t get any responses on my last post, so Iâ€™ll try again. 


Hey all, I've been checking in on my retirement portfolio lately, and I have a few questions.  I'll list all my info first


33, married, first baby due in September


Currently maxing out my 401(k) and my Roth IRA, here's my combined portfolio between both accounts: (percentages are rounded)


25.5%  VTSAX (entire Roth IRA)

25%  FSPSX

16%  FXAIX

9.5%  FIDELITY CONTRAFUND (benchmark is S&amp;P 500, but only has 300 funds and different weighting. Also higher expense ratio)

7.5%  DFEVX

6%  MPC (a mistake, I know)

6%  FSMAX

3%  DODIX

.5%  VBMPX


Overall allocation:

63%  US Equity

32.5%  INTL Equity

3.5%  Bond/income


1)  I bought MPC through the employee stock purchase program in my 401(k) when everyone thought they were doing great.  Since then, the stock has done nothing but drop, and I am down about $4k from my total cost basis (25% of my MPC investment).  I still believe the stock will get back to where it was and beyond, but I don't know how long that will take.  When do you cut your losses on an investment?  I know I'm losing money on not being invested in something like FXAIX that is producing returns.  Should I hold or sell?

2)  Do I have redundant holdings?  Should I try to reduce down to 4-5 holdings or is it not that big of a deal?  Fees aren't really an issue.  My most expensive holding is DFEVX at .64% gross exp ratio.


3)  How should I use my money after I max out my 401(k)?  I put back 17% of my paycheck, and I will probably max out in October or November.  I can still get a 7% employer match through after-tax contributions.  I don't have much retirement savings outside of my 401(k) and Roth IRA.  Should I be saving money in a taxable account since I plan to retire when I'm 55?  How should I plan for the years between retirement and 59.5 years old when I can start withdrawing from my Roth IRA?",Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes,No
fg3scc,Teddyworks,"Windfall advice, and also some retirement savings tax treatment

We could use some advice on our current situation. Weâ€™ll be having a windfall from the sale of a rental property soon. After paying off the mortgage, we should have about $25k leftover. Weâ€™re trying to figure out how to handle it. 
 
Me: 33
My wife: 28
First child due in September!!

**Income:**

Me: $120k minimum (hourly employee with plenty of overtime opportunities)
Wife: $60k

**Debt:**

$120k mortgage at 3.25%

**Savings and investments:**

$7k high-yield savings
$8k HSA (maxing out)
$120k 401(k) (maxing out)
$40k my Roth IRA (maxing out)
$8k her Roth IRA 
$4k Fidelity brokerage

**1.)** How should we use the $25k windfall?  We have considered paying it all as a principal payment on our current mortgage, or using it all to begin investing more in our brokerage account. Most likely would be in an index fund. I know I could probably have higher returns than 3.25% in the stock market, but it would also be a huge weight off our shoulders if we paid off the mortgage by the time Iâ€™m 40 too...

**2.)** We also plan to start maxing out her IRA. We have been thinking more about using a traditional IRA. Our AGI was $173k after our 2019 tax returns. It will lower a little bit next year after selling our rental property. If we used a traditional IRA, it might drop us down to the 22% bracket? I have always been confused on how to handle this situation, but I basically just split my savings 50/50 between pre-tax and after-tax. I can save Roth contributions in my 401k as well. 

**EDIT**: did some additional searches and found my answer. Looks like we cannot take a tax deduction on a traditional IRA with our high income. 

**3.)** I own a few individual stocks in my brokerage account, and plan to buy some more in the future. This is just more as a hobby than anything. But should I open an IRA with Fidelity to start buying those individual stocks in the tax-advantaged IRA?",Yes,Yes,No,Yes,No

rxrbt1,Teddyworks,"Possibly purchasing farm ground in the future.. is it generally a good investment?

So we have a rather interesting family situation so itâ€™s a little tough to describe. Weâ€™re in the *VERY* early stages of this discussion, so Iâ€™m just trying to get a decent handle on things before more serious discussions and talking to lawyers and bankers. 

Essentially, my wife and I live on a 1 acre lot (we own) in the middle of a family owned (her family) farm land. We expected to have this land passed down to us (although I knew things might get complicated someday). 

Now, a family member that is the main executor (not sure thatâ€™s the right term) of the revocable trust wants to sell their portion of ownership in order to move away and stay close to their son in their retirement. 

So now we own our home in this cornfield and we are somewhat in a tough spot. Itâ€™s a lot of money. We would roughly be buying 70 acres of farmland. Itâ€™s already rented out to a farmer. Thereâ€™s also oil wells and we would have mineral rights, although I donâ€™t believe theyâ€™re major producers. Iâ€™m guessing a few bpd for each of the 4 wells. 

Letâ€™s presume that the cash rent and oil payments would cover 80% of the yearly mortgage and tax payments (since I have no idea of the specifics, only taking my best guess). So some money would be coming out of our pocket. We can afford this, although not saying itâ€™s ideal. 

Generally, I stick to the Boglehead approach, but it sure seems like a lot of people around here buy up land like itâ€™s the best investment. I guess what Iâ€™m asking.. what kind of things do I need to think about ahead of buying? Obviously I donâ€™t know much about land ownership. What are some benefits that Iâ€™m not seeing?

We could easily just continue on as we have been and have a fantastic retirement and all those normal things.  We also feel like we are capable of more, and being a Boglehead.. it's very hard to feel like you're accomplishing much (even though you are).

&amp;#x200B;

So we're kind of looking for ideas.  I've really been thinking we need to meet with a CFP, which is on our outlook as well.  I'll give a quick rundown of our financials

&amp;#x200B;

**\*\*Income (combined) -\*\***

\- 2021 AGI $185k

**\*\*Debts -\*\***

\- Home - $108k 14 years left @ 2.25% (Appraised at $165k)

\- Minivan - $18k 3 years left @ 2.5%

**\*\*Savings -\*\***

\- HYSA - $35k (emergency &amp; large upcoming expense)

\- Brokerage - $50k (mostly S&amp;P500)

\- 401k - $250k (Pre-tax)(max-out every year)

\- Roth IRA - $95k (both accounts combined/ max both out every year)

&amp;#x200B;

So we had saved up to remodel our kitchen which is why we have such a large savings.  Well we got to that point and we really weren't inclined to follow through.  Then we got word of a future opportunity to buy a large amount of income producing farm-ground from family (roughly 80 acres @ $6k-$10k/acre).  So we've kind of held on to this money to see how that situation turns out.

&amp;#x200B;

We're now kind of at an impasse.  The farm-ground purchase could go either way, and still might be a few years out before its available.  We've considered real estate, but our schedules are so hectic, that I'm not sure it's viable for our happiness/marriage quality (we both work shift work).  Rentals are promising if they're quality properties that wouldn't need much renovating/maintenance.  We're in a small town in Southern IL, so higher rent prices can be a tough sell.

&amp;#x200B;

We've kind of held off on paying down our debt because the rates are so dang low, and we feel we have a pretty safe cushion should something happen.

p4mng2,TheRealMulli,"401(k) questionâ€¦

The company I work for matches 50% up to 6% of pre-tax income so with that and reading around the webs about contributing 15%-20% of your gross income and since I get paid weekly, how much should I invest per paycheck? I put down 10% per paycheck and I get paid about $420 per week so thatâ€™s $42 a week into my 401(k). Am I doing too much or is this fine? 

I was going to follow the 50/30/20 rule and since 20% goes to savings I figured Iâ€™d take 10% weekly and put into my companyâ€™s 401(k) and the other 10% will go into my personal savings.

But could yâ€™all let me know if this is a good plan atm

So as I said I bring home about $420/week and if I break that down via the 50/30/20 rule, that gives me $210/week for needs, $126/week for wants and $84/week for savings. 

Needs are around $550/month, Wants run about $50/month and then after the 10% contribution into my works 401(k) Iâ€™d have $42 left per week to throw into personal savings. 

Is this a good starting point or should I change anything?",Yes,Yes,No,Yes,Yes

So Iâ€™m starting to budget and trying to get a hold on my money and am currently looking at going with the 50/30/20 Rule. My question is since I mostly see that 401(k) is counted along with the 20% savings, how should I go along breaking down my weekly check via this rule?

For my 401(k) I do 6% cuz my employer matches up to 50% of the first 6%

So to break it down imma low ball on how much I usually bring home per week:

$400/wk (itâ€™s usually more than this by maybe $20-$40, but to be on the safe side Iâ€™ll say only $400)

Now Iâ€™ve got two bank accounts, one at Ally and the other at Capital One. Ally is for bills and emergency fund since they have the savings buckets so each paycheck Iâ€™ve got 70% going into my Ally Checking which then I split up into needs and savings. The remaining 30% of my paycheck goes to Capital One for my Daily Checkingâ€™s for you guessed it wants and daily stuff. 

My question is, since the 401(k) is taken into consideration for the 20% savings and Iâ€™m only putting in 6% into that, that means Iâ€™ve got 14% left to budget into an emergency fund savings so with that 70% Iâ€™m putting into my Ally account, should I divvy it up as 56% into my Bills and then that 14% into emergency fund or just keep it as is 50% still into Needs and 20% still into Savings?

Hey everyone! I had a business go under last August where I had to refund almost all of our clients. When I ran out of money to refund them, I asked them all to open PayPal disputes to get their money back. Since August Iâ€™ve had a negative $44,000 PayPal balance. 

Iâ€™m 23 and got a job last month and Iâ€™m very, very slowly digging myself out of all the debt I got myself in (around $70,000), but Iâ€™ve been waiting for PayPal to send this account and balance to collections. 

They charged it off but for some reason they are keeping it in house, which is fine, but they donâ€™t accept payment plans. I find it odd because my personal account had a negative $1,000 balance a while back for too long and they very quickly sent that to an external collections agency where I set up a payment plan and got it paid off.

Whatâ€™s odd is that except for one phone call to my house in October they havenâ€™t contacted me at all. Iâ€™ve been calling them more than theyâ€™ve been calling me. 

The account is closed/charged off (I canâ€™t log in either), but every time I call and ask for the contact info of the collections agency they sent it to Iâ€™m told they are still holding it with their in house collections.

gk1qol,thesonofnarcs,"Iâ€™m 24 years old and heavily in debt - how can I thrive while paying it off and get past the shame, paralysis, and fear Iâ€™m feeling?

Hey everyone! Iâ€™m a 24 year old guy living with my parents. 

I just graduated college in December after 5.5 years. 

From 2016 through the summer of 2019 I built what got to be a large, fast growing, and successful business until I closed it in August last summer. 

Over the course of almost four years I worked with hundreds of clients and built a name for myself until it all came crashing down. 

I had only paid myself $1,000 a month as a salary and mistakenly reinvested every penny back in the business without any kind of cushion or saving anything for myself. 

The failed business left me heavily, heavily in debt at 23 years old. $68k to be exact 

Iâ€™m an entrepreneur to my core. At 24 Iâ€™ve never had a â€œreal jobâ€ working for anyone but myself. 

Iâ€™ve been working on launching a new business, but the shame, anxiety, and fear has lead to mental paralysis. 

Itâ€™s just this big secret Iâ€™m keeping.

While I am paying them $500 a month for rent, My parents have no clue. They arenâ€™t very supportive of me being an entrepreneur as it is and we are on shaky ground relationship wise because of it. They make good money but they couldnâ€™t help even if they wanted to.

I got myself into this mess and somehow some way will get out of it myself. 

Throughout last fall and early this year Iâ€™ve went to each creditor one by one and explained my situation. Theyâ€™ve all been very understanding. 

The payment plans Iâ€™m on with each creditor are manageable and very, very long term (two creditors make up 75% of what I owe and both have me on 4 year payment plans), but just the thought of having that much debt for such a long time is causing me so much anxiety. 

None of the debt is on my credit report. My score is 680. 

The one thing that scares me to death is the UCC lien Kabbage filed for the the loan I took toward the end of the business.

I guess my question is how do you remain productive and at peace mentally while in debt? How do you pace yourself? 

Iâ€™m a big thinker and am not the most patient person. The thought of it potentially taking 4 years to be debt free alone leaves me paralyzed mentally if that makes sense. 

I just keep pushing myself to find a way to make more money faster. Itâ€™s put me in this never ending spiral of churning through business ideas and chasing money.",Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes

i5h02m,thesonofnarcs,"Why you have to look beyond the balance sheet: A Cautionary Tale

For almost 7 years I was a dyed in the wool value investor. I did very well. 

As I would look back on stocks I passed on investing over the years I saw many of them went to zero or close to it. 

So, I got the bright idea of using LEAP put options on companies I would never go long on. 

I started in the casino, hotel, and resort space. I spent two weeks one by one researching and then ranking each company based from strongest to weakest on all the metrics and benchmarks Graham talks about in the Intelligent Investor (interest coverage, what their bonds yielded, working capital, credit rating, etc.)

My goal was to find the absolute weakest company in the sector/industry. A company with an atrocious balance sheet that was barely surviving. 

In my mind I thought it would be the perfect one to bet against. 

I found it. It was Penn National Gaming (PENN). They ranked number one as the weakest company. They have billions in debt, negative working capital, negative tangible book value, and not enough money before tax to cover the interest payment.

They have had to continually issue new shares and dilute their stock. Their current shares outstanding are 200% higher than they were 4 years ago. 

PENN reached a low of $3.50 during the March crash. When I finished my research it was at $28.

My thesis was that with the company being in such horrible financial shape and their casinos being closed for so long would take the stock back down and potentially make the company file Chapter 11. 

Even if their casinos reopened I did not think that they could survive on a fraction of their former traffic. 

With all that in mind it seemed like it was possible for the stock to go back to what it was in March. 

I had such conviction I invested $1,000 in puts with a $3 strike that expire in January.

I made one big mistake. I didnâ€™t know about Dave Portnoy when I initiated my position. I didnâ€™t think Barstool could generate enough revenue to save them. 

Dave Portnoy is the equivalent of Elon Musk in the sports world. Just like Elonâ€™s tweets move Tesla Portnoy has been able to move PENN.

I donâ€™t blame him. I just made the mistake of overestimating the influence one person can have on a stock. 

Today the stock is worth $49. I bought my puts when stock was at $28. 

Iâ€™m down 70%. The money I lost does sting, but it doesnâ€™t bother me. 

I went in knowing I could lose it all or make 42X my money. I saw it as an asymmetric bet. 

But, at 24 years old this lesson will stick with me the rest of my investing career.

onieor,thesonofnarcs,"PayPal contracted my debt balance to a collection agency and then took it back in house?

I owe PayPal $40,000 from a failed business two years ago when I was 23

In the spring of 2020 after not hearing from them for almost 7 months I emailed the executive team/CEO and told them my story. 

I asked for a payment plan. 

Some high level executive had the COO of the debt collection agency they contract with (meaning they didnâ€™t sell the balance) call me personally and oversee my account. 

He was managing my account personally (meaning the main agency wasnâ€™t calling and it wasnâ€™t in their teams system). He knew my story and basically just said to pay when I can and what I can and that PayPal would be monitoring my payments.

I paid off $4,000 of it in a year. 

Today I called to make a payment and was told that the account was removed from the agency and to call PayPal. 

My hope was that it was sent to another agency that I could set up a new payment plan with.

I called PayPal and was told it was back in house with them. 

I guess I wasnâ€™t paying fast enough?

The problem is they donâ€™t and wonâ€™t accept or set up Payment plans because itâ€™s not a line of credit and thereâ€™s no interest (itâ€™s just a negative balance).

They said that I can call and make partial payments as often as I want but thereâ€™s nothing to setup. 

The lady in the collections department also didnâ€™t know how long theyâ€™ll keep it in house.

They also wonâ€™t settle. The collection agency was willing to knock $10,000 off.

Iâ€™m a little freaked out by all the ambiguity from PayPal. I had a smaller balance with them in another account (that Iâ€™ve since paid off) from the same business and they called my parents house at all hours.

I'm interested in financial independence and would like to start working towards it.  
Right now, I'm in $82,000 of unsecured debt and $20,000 of student loans.  
I currently work as a driver for a federal contractor, which is dependent on passing a security clearance, which is unlikely. So I will be looking for another job soon. I think my earning potential is anywhere from $18,000 to $40,000 a year, depending on the job.  
Right now, my expenses are very low because I live with my parents, rent free. They also pay for my car insurance and phone bill.  
My only recurring expenses are gas, health insurance, and dental insurance.  
Until my current job asks me to leave, I plan to use my money to:  
Get a root canal  
Take care of car maintenance and repairs that I've been putting off  
Move into an apartment

175ja8s,TheVoicesTalkToMe,"Budgeting for Therapy

I have BPD. Therapists trained in DBT, which is recommended for BPD, generally only accept one insurance in network. That's fine. I'm paying $140 a month for that one specific insurance. Next, there is a long waiting list to become a patient. That's fine. However, the biggest issue is that they charge anywhere from $100-$175 a session, and treatment requires a session each week. Treatment is minimum six months to a year to see improvement, two years until I can reasonably expect BPD to no longer severely impact my life. 

  
That's $400 on the low end to $700 on the high end \*each month\* just for therapy. Plus the $140 for health insurance. 

  
I'm making $18/hour plus an extra $4/hour bonus at my job, so it's combined $22/hour. This is the high end for salary for my occupation.

  
The problem comes in that [I am roughly $80k in debt right now](https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/16s5qo3/30k_on_credit_report_sued_and_judgment_obtained/). 

  
It's very likely that I will lose my job because it requires a security clearance and my debts will be called into question. That's fine. I could find another job paying anywhere from $12-$15/hour.

Hello! Quick question for you all.

I have a 2016 Honda Civic, which I love. I got it when I was in college and it's treated me very well. It's been on a lot of road trips with me and as a result it's got about 160,000 miles on the odometer. Despite the high miles, it still runs well, and the only expenses I've incurred with it are routine upkeep (tires, brakes, fluids, etc.). And the body is still in beautiful shape.

My question is this -- does it make more financial sense to trade in periodically, or should I run my Honda until the wheels fall off? A local dealership estimates I could get around $12,000-$15,000 for it given the current state of the car market, and I could afford to level up to a newer Civic or Accord with lower miles. On the other hand, I could probably continue to drive this car for another five years (or more), though the trade-in value by then will probably be next to nothing.

So, which scenario makes more financial sense? Trade in and bank a good chunk of money to put toward a newer model with fewer miles, or run the car until it dies, at which time I'll have to buy a new car without the benefit of being able to trade in my Civic for the cost of half the new car?

Needless to say, I was really hoping not to have a car payment for the foreseeable future -- especially given the fact that I recently graduated from college and wanted to put all the money I possibly could toward a downpayment on a home and invest the rest.

But, unfortunately, I am now in the market for another car. My insurance payout will help, but my car had high miles, and therefore there's still going to be at least a $10,000 gap between the value of my old Civic and the value of a newer model (I will probably buy a Honda Insight, which is essentially a hybrid version of the Civic). Obviously, this is a terrible time to be in the market for a car, as prices have inflated at least 35% on used cars.

So, given this less-than-ideal situation, what is the most financially responsible thing to do? I can either pay for a new Honda that will likely last a decade or more, or I can pay slightly less for a used Honda that may not have been maintained properly by the previous owner and may not last as long due to previous use. Also, I can afford to pay for the car in full, but I think it may be more financially prudent to secure a low APR loan and invest the money I would otherwise be spending to pay the car off in full.

Advice would be greatly appreciated. Thank you all so much.

EDIT: I can get a 2022 Honda Insight for $26,500 or a used model for a couple thousand dollars less. Even the equivalent of what I had (2016 Honda Civic) would be around $20,000 for a model with under 50,000 miles. Really an awful time to be in the market for a car.",Yes,Yes,No,Yes,No
s83c80,throwaway_4829890973,"My car was recently totaled and now I'm in the market for another. However, I am leaving the country soon, which complicates things a little. What do you think of this idea?

Hi, everyone!

Unfortunately, my car was recently totaled by another driver, and I am now in need of another car for everyday use. However, I will likely be leaving the country for an extended period in four months, which complicates this situation. I can either buy a used car (Honda) at an inflated price, considering the current state of the used car market, or I can opt for something a bit more unconventional: I could buy a new Honda Accord, use it for a few months, and then sell it back (either to a dealership or on the private market) when it comes time to leave.

Considering the current value of used cars (which I don't imagine will go down much in only a few months), I think this may be a decent way for me to give myself a means of transportation while recouping most of my money down the road.

Is this something that would be financially wise, in your opinion, or do you think used car values will start to deflate sooner than April?

Thanks!",Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes,No
sb4uva,throwaway_4829890973,"My car was totaled by another driver, so I am in the market for another car. Should I buy a dramatically overpriced (but cheaper) used car, or a slightly more expensive new car?

My 2016 Honda Civic (160,000 miles) was totaled by another driver recently, so I am unfortunately in the market for another car. I am anticipating a \~$15,000 payout from the insurance company -- which would be enough to get me into another high-mileage Civic, but I'm not sure it would be wise to pay for a used car that has 160,000 miles already. 

**So, I am left in a bind. As you are probably aware, used car prices have increased 35% over the last year. That in mind, I have found several 2016-2018 Honda Accords with \~50,000-70,000 miles for between $23,000 and $26,000 OTD, while a new Accord with zero miles would cost me closer to $30,000 OTD.** 

The same is true of Civics: used Civics with \~75,000 miles are often selling for only slightly less (and sometimes more!) than \*new\* Civics, so I would be in the same situation if I decided to buy another Civic (but I would prefer an Accord).

I am also factoring anticipated depreciation into my calculus. As the used car market begins to cool down over the next year or two, I would expect a used Accord priced at $24,000 now to lose a third of its value or more, which is a huge waste of money and probably even worse in terms of depreciation than a new Accord.

I know buying new is typically frowned upon in this sub, but considering the state of the used car market right now, which do you think is the better choice?",Yes,Yes,No,Yes,No

Almost four months later, it has approximately 3,500 miles and I need to sell it because I will be moving out of the country (I did not know about this when I purchased the car).

Hi!

As I said in the title, my uncle recently passed and as a consequence I have been left with a decent chunk of money (around $200,000). I'm not exactly sure what to do with it yet, but I am certain that I want to use it to build further wealth rather than squander it by letting it sit in a bank account or some other low-interest vehicle. 

I have thought about putting it all into an ETF (such as VTI), especially considering I'd be buying at a significant discount relative to when it was selling for $240/share last year. However, my preference would be to use a significant portion of the money to build a stream of passive income, probably by investing in a rental property or two.

I used to see a dentist close to my office for a dental cleaning and stuff. He took an X-Ray of my whole mouth barely 6 months ago. Now I switched jobs and I found a new dentist closer to my home and she has great reviews on Google/Yelp.

My new insurance only allows a full mouth X-Ray once in 3 years. And since I have new insurance she wants to do a brand new X-Ray of my whole mouth again. I got a copy of my X-Rays which at this point is barely 6 months old and she is refusing to use those :| She wants to do an X-Ray again. This is just a routine dental checkup/cleaning that I get every 6 months.

I have two concerns at this point. (1) If I do have to get an X-Ray maybe next year for an actual problem, I would have to pay for it out of pocket. (2) I don't want to get an X-Ray for no justifiable reason. X-rays are radiation. Just because it is free, I am not going to bombard my mouth with radiation, because this dentist can bill my insurance company an extra 100$.

On the whole, to me, it feels like the dentist is just being greedy. I called her and asked her why she wants to get another X-Ray and she is like because it is free. I want to get my own X-Ray done.

So I always end up wasting a crap ton of time thinking about these kinds of problems I face with budgeting money. This is a mathematical problem I think rather than a pure finance problem. I spent hours trying to solve this in excel, but I am not able to convince myself one way or another. So I thought I would finally ask for help here.

* I bought a mobile phone for 950$ on March 31st using my credit card.
* My credit card company posts my statement on April 15th.
* I have to pay off my balance by May 13th.
* Between now and May 13th, I will receive 4 paychecks, with the final paycheck being on May 13th coincidentally.
* If I pay off my balance on May 13th, I would not have to pay any interest at all. So essentially I got a 0% interest loan for 1.5 months.

Now, I make enough money that I can pay off 950$ from a single paycheck. So my question is, should I pay off 950$ using my May 13th paycheck alone or should I set aside some portion of my salary from each paycheck up until my May 13th paycheck?

I invest my surplus money into ETFs. I don't sell any of my ETFs unless I am trying to rebalance my portfolio. I have no plans to rebalance my portfolio this year.

* 20% VTWO(Russell 2000)
* 20% VEU(FTSE Ex-US index)

hxxhm6,ToKeepAndToHoldForev,"Is it dumb to pick between two near-identical funds based on the fact that the one with the higher cost (.15% versus .12%) was easier to find on their website?

I just feel like being able to find the Vanguard Target Retirement 2065 fund on their website without any special googling makes it better in my mind. I couldn't find the right page for the Fidelity Freedom Index 2065 fund from their website through the IRA section. You have to go to Research &gt;&gt; Mutual Funds and either toy with the buttons and stuff based on risk and other specifications or search up the target date you want. If you go through the IRA section, they only show their non-freedom index funds.

On the other hand, I don't know if .03% is a dumb amount of money to leave on the table if it's for retirement. My calculator (just desmos nothing special) says .15% versus .12% of a million is a difference of 300 dollars. I doubt $1M \* (.0015 or .0012) is the right way to do that math, but still.

I got a 2-year CD for $500 at Fifth Third a year and a month ago as an 18-year-old when the rates were .15% APY. I didn't know online CDs and savings accounts existed and my personal finance knowledge was limited to a personal finance class that still suggested treasury bills around 2015. 

I didn't plug the numbers into a CD calculator until 6 months in (nor did I have any intuition on returns, just that .15% was and is more than my bank account), and I wouldn't have bought the CD if I knew I'd tie up $500 for two years to make it $501.5.

Wife works... but for this scenario, her income not included... mostly going to pay out kids college costs. 

we refi'ed house @ 118k fir 20 years at 2.99% last summer. present balance is 97k. I make the monthly payment.

I send 1k/week to mortgage principal.
I send appx. 750/week to Roth IRA. (might be more-never less)
I send appx. 500/week to brokerage account.(might be more-never less)

When Roth IRA gets maxed out in a couple of weeks...that money will be sent to mortgage principal...maybe dump some of it in brokerage account if I feel like I need to buy something. 

I'd like to have 100k in deposits to Roth IRA by the time I retire. (or as close too 100k as possible).
I'd like to have 100k+ in deposits to brokerage account by the time I retire.
I'd like to have the house paid off by next year.
There is no rhyme or reason to these numbers - I had a vision while showering one day ...which commenced with the refi the next day.

No car loans. 
No CC balances outstanding.

1) JP Morgan equity income R5 (OIERX) - ER 0.55%
2) American funds new economy R4 (RNGEX) - ER 0.76%

I donâ€™t have much clue about these funds but I think they have higher fees so I was thinking he should just swap those to vanguard funds but the Ascensus site that handles his 401k doesnâ€™t have VTâ€™s equivalent mutual fund, VTWAX. And there are no ETFs available either.

My dad in Canada ordered a pair of shoes from a US website for $80 from some unknown site that he saw on his Instagram ads. On checking later, I found the same pair was available on AliExpress for $13. It was too late to cancel the order though as I had received an email saying that the shoes had been dispatched by â€œChina Postâ€. I asked them why it says China if theyâ€™re â€œheadquarteredâ€ in the US and they said their TOS state that their products ship from all over the world. Which means it would take forever to reach.

Besides, I really donâ€™t want my dad to pay 6x for these cheap quality shoes and he wants to return them but the website says returns are NOT FREE, the Cx must pay for return shipping. Iâ€™m definitely not going to want him to pay for return shipping all the way to China and wait another 3-6 months to get the money back.

I am 32, a Canadian Permanent Resident residing in Canada since 7-8 years, with a pending US green card application thatâ€™s due in 2023. Had a few questions:

1) Since I have most of my savings in USD (~$60k) and also intend to move to the US in the future, I want to start investing in USD stocks in my tax-sheltered TFSA (the Canadian equivalent of a Roth IRA I believe), which I will have to move to a non-registered USD brokerage account when I move to the US, rather than buying CAD stocks to avoid currency conversion fees. Correct me if Iâ€™m wrong with this logic.

2) I would like to primarily like to invest for long-term growth and read up on Vanguardâ€™s asset-allocation ETFs like VGRO, VEQT, but unfortunately theyâ€™re all CAD denominated. Does it really matter if I purchase CAD securities like VGRO in my Questrade TFSA account that Iâ€™ve funded with USD or would I lose too much in conversion fees? 

3) If thatâ€™s true, what are the USD equivalents of VGRO, VEQT, etc that I could purchase on a Canadian brokerage like Questrade using USD?

4) I was thinking about mimicking the Vanguard 2050 Retirement Funds allocation, but that means I would have to re-balance regularly myself. So 55% VTI, 35% VXUS, 6% BND and 4% BNDX at present. Would that be better?

My father is 66, still working but not investing-savvy, and I finally started investing for him post-lockdown (better late than never) in a simple 2-fund portfolio that we wouldnâ€™t need to look at too often considering a broad time horizon: 60% VT and 40% BNDW.

Out of the $164k Iâ€™ve invested over the past year or two in the above portfolio, he currently stands at $143k (down approx. $21k or 13% till date) which now stands as follows:

VT: $89k


BNDW: $54k

(Ratio is 62:38, havenâ€™t re-balanced in a while.. I actually find this kind of weird because stocks have dropped more than bonds so the ratio should have been tilted towards bonds?! But anyway, thatâ€™s not the main point of the post.)

I am now trying to correct it so VT:(BNDW+cash) is 60:40 because I guess thatâ€™s the correct way and cash must be included in the 40%?

Hereâ€™s my proposed plan for the $64k savings account balance and needed advice:

1) Buy $35k more of VT so total VT would be $124k

2) Buy $20k of i-bonds ($10k each under his and his wifeâ€™s name)

1) Ascensus 401k (OIERX+ANEFX): 37k

2) Fidelity VT: 104k

3) Fidelity BNDW: 53k

4) i-Bonds: 30k

5) Cash at bank: 35k (need 10k to buy ibonds and 14k for self+spouse IRA contribution in 2023)

Equity/(bonds+cash) = 54.5% to 45.5%.

If he retires next year, he will draw a total of $3.3k in SS benefits. If he retires at 70, he will draw a total of $4.7k in SS benefits.

1) Does his portfolio look okay or needs any changes or rebalancing? Should I swap out the JP Morgan and American Funds New Economy mutual funds and buy VTSAX in his 401k? 

2) Is he in a good financial condition to retire next year or is better off delaying retirement until 70?

I think I know the answer, but here's how it reads (not sure what parts of this are relevant, so I'll simply post the entire text):


**Claiming children as dependents on tax forms:   the parties have the right to claim the children on their tax forms as follows: every year (ex-wife) has the right to claim (child one) and (child two).  For tax years where a non-custodial parent has the right to claim the children, the parents must cooperate to fill out and submit IRS form 8332 in a timely manner.**

**The parents are designated joint custodians of the children solely for the purposes of state and federal statues which require designation or determination of custody.  If only one parent can be named custodian, it shall be the mother in even-numbered years and the father in odd-numbered years.  This designation shall not change the parenting rights and responsibilities described in this plan.  Washington state law generally refers to parenting time and decision-making rather than custody.

rfxftc,TrustyBagOfPlaylists,"Is my approach to budgeting for a home purchase conservative, aggressive, or just right?

Hi allâ€¦Iâ€™m sure this is a worn-out subject for most of you.  Please understand that, while Iâ€™ve done extensive research on this sub and outside of it, Iâ€™m always going to seek out more confirmation because this is one of the two or three most important purchases of my lifetime.

Iâ€™m in a comparatively low-cost-of-living area (but itâ€™s growing as rapidly as any place in America; Knoxville area).  Iâ€™m looking at making a purchase in spring to early summer of next year.  I have $30k in a discretionary portfolio.  I have $25k in savings/checking.  My non-housing costs total $800-$1k/mo.  My after tax/retirement take-home is about $2900/mo.  Iâ€™m currently saving about $1k/mo.

Iâ€™m looking at a purchase in the $140k-$200k range, depending on how aggressive I choose to get.  I can probably cut discretionary spending by as much as $150/mo.  Iâ€™m drawn towards the idea of a 20% down payment to avoid PMI.  If we assume my $30k portfolio is liquid, to be used on costsâ€¦and that my $25k in bank accounts will grow to $30k by the time this comes yo fruition, how risky is a purchase in the range Iâ€™m considering?

If I want to keep an emergency fund of ~$9k, expect closing costs of $5k, and immediate expenses of $5k (Iâ€™d likely be buying a home built between 1940 and 1970), that would leave me with with roughly $40k to use on a down payment.",Yes,Yes,No,Yes,No
szyrvh,TrustyBagOfPlaylists,"Some Micro information that I learned today in a conversation with a mortgage lender (student loans, time lines, etc).

Iâ€™m just putting this out there in case others have similarly mistaken ideas of how things will work for you.  As someone whoâ€™s been paying in his student loans for 10+ years and still has &gt;$100k to pay, Iâ€™ve done a fair amount of research as to what I can possibly do to own a home.  But, that research didnâ€™t reveal some things to me.  Hopefully it helps.

My biggest misconception is that my debt to income ratio would impact my interest rate.  Iâ€™d waited longer than necessary to start this process because of it.  According to the two lenders Iâ€™ve spoken to, DTI has much more to do with whether you qualify for a mortgage at allâ€¦and which programs you might qualify for.  It has a much smaller effect on interest rates.  Even though their current, non-ideal formula (.5% of total debt paid monthly) is much more than I would actually pay on ibr (by about $500/mo), I was still given a 4.25% estimateâ€¦which is competitive.

Secondly, whatever rates youâ€™ve researched are subject to change until you â€˜lock inâ€™ your rate, which happens after youâ€™re ready or have made an offer on a property, which can happen 2-5 months, or more, after youâ€™ve been pre-approved for your mortgage loan.  That difference in that amount of time can be staggering.

Step 1) get pre approved by having your credit pulled and giving basic info.  Step 2) search for and find a house.  Step 3) get real numbers and lock in a rate.  Step 4) submit your offer.  At some point in there, Iâ€™m sure the inspection happens.  I imagine between step 3 and 4â€¦but unsure.  Also can speak to subsequent steps yet.

Iâ€™ve been contemplating a home-purchase for 2-3 years.  I am on realtor.com, Zillow, Facebook, and Craigslist 2-3 times per week during that entire time.

I just recently went through the process of talking to two recommended agents, of whom I chose one.  He took me on visits to houses this past Thursday.

I live in a townhouse with 2 people I trust and like (even though Iâ€™d rather separate), paying $~580/mo for rent/utilities (and believe I can lock in that rent for the next ~15 months, although I believe it could go up considerably after that).  I have $24k immediately available and another $25k in a portfolio that I can divest from if needed.

Thereâ€™s a 3BR/2BA house that I like at $185k asking.  It was built in 1900 but was newly renovated in the last year â€” everything VISIBLE is new (roof, siding, flooring, cabinets, appliances, etc).  Iâ€™ll find out more about plumbing/foundation/electrical soon.

The cost for mortgage/tax/homeowners/PMI would be ~$1025-$1050/mo with a 10% down payment ($18500).  My other monthly (non-housing) costs amount to $800-$825.  If I set aside $200/mo for water/electric (1240 sq feet) and $325/mo for housing maintenance costs, my take home of $2800/mo leaves me with roughly $5k/yr of savings.

I expect an increase of pay in the next year (although I could, of course, be wrong) of roughly 10-15%.  I have an additional $30k in retirement accounts as well.

I only currently spend ~21% of my take home on rent and utilities.  While arguing for buying a home, I realized that Iâ€™d be spending 35.5% on mortgage/tax/insurance.  44% if I include utilities/internet.  53% if I set aside a reasonable amount for maintenance.  While I think that math doesnâ€™t fairly compare how much I can invest with free money versus how much Iâ€™m investing into equity, itâ€™s still a stark realization.


But, itâ€™s tough seeing people who are doing things less responsibly getting things youâ€™re too cautious to opt into.  Of course you tell yourself that some of them will either be forced out of their situation or even lose everything.  But some will pull it off.  And Iâ€™m jealous of them.

Iâ€™ll continue to rentâ€¦and share a place with two roommates.  Iâ€™ll save money for another year â€” maybe even more.  I just hope that I donâ€™t regret these decisions when I finally spend the capital Iâ€™ve been working towards for so long.

EDIT:  sorry I bailed on this, everyone.  Iâ€™ll re-visit after work.  Iâ€™m glad itâ€™s a topic thatâ€™s spurring on some discussion, though.",Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes
tysdtp,TrustyBagOfPlaylists,"Could someone help me understand spirit of the emergency fund?

I donâ€™t know.  But, in my mind, the emergency fund is there to help for job-loss or short-term needs.  As a non-home-owner, the biggest short term need I had is something like a car emergency.

Common-thinking seems to be that an emergency fund should cover 3-6 months expenses.  Common-thinking also seems to conclude that these funds should be kept in a bank account.  Iâ€™m asking why these funds need to, exclusively, come from a bank account.

I know there are circumstances where you might need some funds IMMEDIATELY.  But do those circumstances really require 3-6 months expenses?  If 6 months expenses would equate to $12k, why canâ€™t some of those funds me kept in iBonds past their year-long requirement?  Or even a portfolio past the limit for short term capital gains?  if some of those funds would require a business day or two to transact, are they really not worth considering as emergency funds?",Yes,Yes,No,Yes,No
v54l0u,TrustyBagOfPlaylists,"I can feel myself getting worried and am trying to keep myself from making rash decisions.

My living situation is in total flux right now.  6 months ago, I was spending $750/mo on housing/utilities/gas.  After one of two roommates leaving, a rent hike, and increased gas costs, Iâ€™m closer to $1150/mo.

Itâ€™s not desperate or anythingâ€¦but I feel my goals slipping so far back that it makes my past progress feel less significant.

w43r5x,TrustyBagOfPlaylists,"Time for a state of the union. Applaud where itâ€™s due; stay silent where itâ€™s due.

Iâ€™m a single 38m.  My route to this point has been unconventional.  I work a state government job in TN.

I make ~$53.5k/yrâ€¦but had been making ~$47.4k/yr my first 2 years in this job.  My living situation had been so financially beneficial that I never bothered to do the incrementals.  But things are changing.  Iâ€™m moving to a more rural area to save money on transportation/commute.  However the lack of roommates and overall increase in rent is taking my cost of living up a few notches.

With the rent Iâ€™m looking at, it would be 21.5% of my gross and 30.5% of my take-home.  If I include utilities in that, Iâ€™ll be spending 26% gross and 37% of my take home.

That means that my savings will now be only 22% of my gross.  And that would move down to 14.5% of gross once I start paying on my student loans again.

I should clarify that I currently contribute 6% of my gross to a retirement account (matched at 5% to my 2% contribution +$100/mo).  Iâ€™m also invested in a state pension that would pay out 1% final income * number of years worked per year post retirement.

w9tsg6,TrustyBagOfPlaylists,"Am I being pedantic with this property management company?

I have to move and am trying to rent in a small town in Tennessee.  Thereâ€™s basically no new development.  But, recently, an investor purchased some old brick triplexes close to a community college and is revamping them.  Apparently, they began this process while current tenants were living there and communicated that they were essentially doubling the rent.

This is a town of less than 10k people outside of Knoxville, tn.  Advertised on their website and on Zillow were apartments listed at 950/mo for a one bedroom and 1050/mo for a two bedroom.  After expressing intent to sign, it was communicated to me that 1 BRâ€™s were 975 and 2 BRâ€™s were 1100.  They framed this by referencing some county utility issues that required water and sewer to be split between two utility companies.  They were including sewer cost in the $975/$1100 rents (but apparently not in their advertisements?)

Referencing the advertisements, their primary booking agent put me on hold to talk to her boss.  And she came back telling me itâ€™s actually $1k for the 1BR and $1.1k for the 2.  I tell her I have to consider my previous statement that Iâ€™d  run numbers while she reached out to the owner.

After talking, she seems proud of herself and tells me she got the owner to agree to $975 even though previous 1BRâ€™s were rented at $1k.  So, I agree to the 1 BR and wait for the lease to be emailed my way.  Once received, the leaseâ€™s utility section makes no mention of this.  Not only does it not mention sewer being included in the rent, but no mention of trash pickup (which is supposed to be included as well).  Iâ€™ve sent first months rent+deposit as a sign of good faith.  But I said I canâ€™t sign the lease until I receive written (emailed) confirmation that trash and sewer are included in the listed rent.

This management group has really solid reviews.  The apartments are in high demand (although, I believe myself to be a desirable tenant).  Am I being too scrupulous?",No,Yes,No,Yes,Yes
xyeze1,TrustyBagOfPlaylists,"When youâ€™re budgeting, is there any way to really visualize where youâ€™re at with so many annual+ spending habits.

Iâ€™ve used mint for years nowâ€¦and itâ€™s been great as a way to track my spending.  But itâ€™s struggling in my efforts to really pin-down and categorize my habits.

Monthly spending is a no-brainer.  Itâ€™s so easy to set aside a certain amount each month for rent, groceries, gas, internet/cell, etc.

But, incorporating spending that happens on less frequent bases obscures things.  I have auto insurance that bills bi-annuallyâ€¦streaming costs that tend to fall annually (prime + year-long promotions)â€¦car maintenance, gift giving, clothing needsâ€¦which kind of just come at their own speed.

And then I have long-term goals like saving for a house or setting aside x-amount every month for a car replacement, should I need itâ€¦or for travel.

Iâ€™m just not sure how to properly visualize everything.  Iâ€™ve recently taken my discretionary savings categoriesâ€¦and grouped them into a â€œdiscretionary savingsâ€ category for mintâ€¦while simultaneously splitting it all into buckets for ally (car savings, travel, gifts, home savings).

yul31w,TrustyBagOfPlaylists,"I know this is largely a personal question. But in my situation, how irresponsible would it be to significantly cut my investment plans for short-term gift giving?

Iâ€™m not someone whoâ€™s well-off comparatively.  Iâ€™m a single, 38 year old making ~$55k in a government job in a low cost of living area.

I have significant student debt of &gt;$100k that Iâ€™ve been paying on for  10 of my 13 years out of school.  I will qualify for PSLF forgiveness after 4 more years of government work.

Even though my housing costs have more than doubled in the last year (rental shortages and living on my own versus roommates), I still manage to save somewhere between 30 and 43% of my gross income (depending on whether you count the 5% deduction for state pension and company match for my 401k).  With the generous math, Iâ€™m saving 16% for retirement (5% pension, 6% 401k contribution, 5% company 401k match).  I save another 26-27%.  That savings is currently bucketed towards 1) gifts, 2) travel, 3) replacement car, and 4) houseâ€¦where any excess goes towards the house savings.

My parents are doing fine with money from a retirement perspective.  They have enough expendable retirement that theyâ€™re even redoing parts of their house for purely aesthetic desires.  But theyâ€™re of an age where Iâ€™m not sure how much longer I have with them or for how much longer theyâ€™re capable of capitalizing on their relative health.  Likewise, my niece sister/niece are fine from a needs perspective.  But they donâ€™t have enough money for the extra stuff.

Im considering setting aside about 8% of my gross income (about 1/3 of my non-retirement savingsâ€¦about 1/2 of what Iâ€™m currently setting aside for house savings) for the next ~5 years to do some hopefully-memorable trips with my family while the opportunity is still there.

Given that Iâ€™m not a big earnerâ€¦that I donâ€™t own my own home yetâ€¦that my plans for the future hinge largely on my keepingy government job 1) through a possible recession and 2) long enough to forgive my student loans, how irresponsible is this decision?

He recommended a safe portfolio for me to put it in which I blindly trustedâ€¦ Literally a few weeks later I found out about index funds and fidelity so for the last couple of months I have done my research and decided it would be best to move my Roth IRA to fidelity which I have initiated the transfer for. And also to just put my 25k in a high yield savings account. Moving the Roth IRA was easy because Iâ€™m investing in for the long term so I was not worried about the market being down. However, my 25k savings account right now is at 23kâ€¦ Not sure what to do. Should I take it out now and just learn this 2k lesson? Or wait for it to come back up to 25k? Iâ€™m afraid that the savings will keep dropping and also that my financial advisor will not care as much anymore because he knows I want to leave. What should I do? I definitely put myself in a precarious position. ðŸ˜ž",Yes,Yes,No,No,Yes

Hello everyone! Iâ€™m setting up my wifeâ€™s Roth IRA and she wants to do a target age fund so she doesnâ€™t have to worry about it at all. (She is an MD) anyway I a thought I wanted the FDKLX for her since she is 31 but when I called Fidelity to get it set up the recommended that I did FIPFX insteadâ€¦ Which I am not sure of why this one is better. I am using the comparing funds that fidelity offers and the main difference to me is that one is 2050 and the other is 2060. The last dividend was $.374 for FIPFX and $.258 for FDKLX. The other difference is that FDKLX has 4 stars and FIPFX has 3 starsâ€¦ so now I am pretty confused on which one to pick.

I ask because if I put into the website that our AGI is 166k our monthly repayment plan comes at almost $1,400. But if I put $145k the repayment plan comes at $900.

This is years down the road for me, but I I know to be insolvent, you need to still have liabilities higher than assets after the student loan debt is forgiven. Since I'm planning on having $450k forgiven, taking advantage of this is really beneficial, as it saves me $150k.

My current system is as follows:

- If my savings account is already &gt;= $2500, the money would go into the stock market for long term investments instead

- Throughout the month, I pay off my CC bill from my checking account. It's very unlikely that I would spend $1000 in two weeks, but if I need to for whatever reason, I would withdraw from the emergency fund to pay off the bill and then replenish the emergency fund when I next get paid

I was suggesting to my friend that he gets a credit card to build credit and get rewards, but he doesn't trust himself to be able to responsibly use a credit card without ending up in debt.

One of my main complaints is that I can't rename or remove/hide any of their default categories, so I'm stuck with a million categories that I don't use, but all of my actual transactions are in 6 categories total.

I'm 18 and I own a 2008 Accord. It has 182,000 miles on it and I bought it one year ago for $7,000. In that one year, I have spent a grand total of $5,000 on maintenance, a lot of big ticket items like the timing belt and water pump. I took it in today and it looks like it needs another $2,000 to even make it safe to drive, not to mention that all 4 wheels are badly bent and need to be replaced eventually (around $1,000), and I don't think the (automatic) transmission has more than 1-2 years left in it (around $3,000 to replace). It also needs a new windshield eventually. I am somewhat mechanically inclined and do some of my own maintenance and repairs but this specific repair is above my level. I'm considering buying a used car in the range of $15,000-25,000 to replace this one - at this point with the amount of money I have put into it, I could have instead bought something nicer that would have lasted me longer. I don't want to get anything crazy, just a simple sedan or something like that.

I currently have about $54,000 in assets if you count my checking account, emergency fund, long term savings, and Roth IRA. Additionally, the car is worth $5000-7000 private party or $4000 trade in. I bring in $3,000 per month after taxes and on average, I spend about half of that on groceries, gas, insurance, rent, and etc. I live with my parents and they charge me $360/month on rent. I don't intend on moving out for at least 1-2 more years from now. My credit score is 765 and if necessary, my parents could cosign on a loan for a new(er) car. I could put as much as $7,500 down and not have to be worried about being able to pay bills.

Given the information here, is it better to accept my mistake and cut my losses on the current car and get a new, sensible car; or should I keep fixing my car and hope it lasts me a bit longer? I am fully aware that buying another car wouldn't make maintenance costs go away, I'm just hoping that the car doesn't keep requiring expensive repairs year after year and also have the possibility of it completely dying on me always in my head every time the transmission slips or jerks.

I just went through my transactions for the month of June and they seem a bit high. I live with my parents and don't pay rent, but I pay for pretty much everything else.

* Gasoline: $268.61
* Restaurants/snacks: $233.94
* Car maintenance: $818.58 (I needed a new alternator and wheel bearing this month. Overall average for car maintenance over the last year is around $400/mo. The car is paid off so that's just the cost to keep it running)
* Fun stuff: $74.57
* Other (gifts, categorized things, etc.): $67.34
* Groceries &amp; home (hard to break this one down, pretty much anything I buy at Walmart. Ranges from carrots to pillows to a hydraulic jack): $578.70
* Health &amp; fitness: $270.00 (my parents don't make me pay rent but they do make me pay for an expensive personal trainer instead, I think it's pretty reasonable since it's a lot less than rent would be and it helps to improve me and help me lose weight)
* Car insurance: $68.47
* Car registration fees: $151.27
* Life &amp; vision insurance: $6.50 (I'm on my parents' health insurance)

After taxes, I brought in $2,894.22. My total spending was $2,399.58. So I am in the green but not by much.

I have no idea where the money is going - I just put it on my credit card and it all shows as Walmart.

xaeudz,USD_bussin,"Can anyone help sanity check my budget? I want to be saving more but I don't see any spending categories to cut

A while back I posted asking for one of these sanity checks and I got a lot of advice. It felt very harsh at the time but it was definitely the wake up call I needed. I set up YNAB and I'm tracking everything in there. I set up my categories based on my spending from the time and since then I've adjusted them as needed based on my spending in months since then.

I currently live with my parents so I have tons of money to do whatever I want with, either saving or spending, and I am trying to use this time in my life to build good habits so they stick with me for the rest of life when things get less forgiving and I won't have my parents as a safety blanket anymore. Not just for finance, I've been trying to cut calories and exercise more and also improve my sleep schedule. Reducing the number of unhealthy snacks and meals out I have been eating definitely helped a lot with my food budget.

Anyway here are my YNAB categories. I'm looking for a sanity check on the actual amounts or some suggestions on how to improve the way I group transactions as well.

- Groceries: $250/mo (down from $400 - really proud of this!)
- Rent: $180/mo
- Gym membership: $18 per month ($15/mo + $50 AF)
- Household (soap, shampoo, floss, toothpaste, etc.): $50/mo
- Car maintenance: $25/mo, but any leftover gets added to the next months budget, so if I don't have any maintenance in the first 2 months I have $75 for maintenance in the 3rd month.
- Gas: $200/mo, this seems to have gone down considerably in recent months due to gas price changes. My commute to work is 24mi round trip and my car gets 24mpg.
- Car insurance: $450 every 6 months
- Car registration fees: $150/year
- Restaurants: $100/mo - I have completely stopped eating out on my own but I go out with my friends every Friday and $25/meal is a pretty good average for this.
- Miscellaneous fun things: $200/mo, I do the same thing as car maintenance so I add $200 to this account every month regardless of how much I spend the last month. I have been averaging under $200 spent each month but I want to keep putting money in here for big ticket items.
- Donations: $10/mo, usually goes to charity or YouTube creators
- Password manager subscription: $10/year
- Google drive subscription: $10/mo
- YNAB: $15/mo
- Savings for gifts/holidays: I have 3 family members and I have decided to save $150 for each of their birthdays, plus $350 for Christmas, so $500/year or $42/mo
- Short term savings (basically an emergency fund but this is also the money I would use for a situation like I'm moving out and need to pay for furniture, deposit, etc. It's got quite a bit of money in it so I should have plenty of an EF even if I needed to spend a large portion on stuff like the apartment expenses mentioned): $500/mo
- Long term savings (invested in safe long term investments, plan to use in 10+ years from now on something like a house down payment): $1000/mo

Any remaining money will go towards savings or just hang out in my bank account.

The total of all the categories added up (not including savings) is about $1200. That is way lower than it used to be and I'm happy about that but it still seems high since I live with my parents and only have to pay for food and gas.

My income is about $3k/mo but it will differ based on hours worked and overtime.

vd8she,valoremz,"Backdoor Roth IRA vs. Mega Backdoor Roth 401k -- what am I missing?

I already max out my traditional 401k and make above the Roth IRA income limit. Let's say I have $6k that I want to put toward retirement. My two options are: 

1) Backdoor Roth IRA ($6K max) -- I would invest $6K in January then do the whole conversion mechanism through Fidelity. 

2) Mega Backdoor Roth 401k ($40,500 max) -- In addition to a traditional 401(k), my employer allows for after-tax contributions into a Roth 401k directly from your paycheck. Fidelity handles the conversion automatically each paycheck. (I know I could convert the after-tax contributions to a Roth IRA instead but my employer has great 401(k) options so I'm not concerned).

So between the two, is there a better option? I'm leaning toward the Mega Backdoor Roth 401k route simply because there's zero work on my end. I don't have to remember to do the whole conversion in January (even though it only takes a few minutes). Also the money just comes directly out of my paycheck and I don't have to move money over from savings into the backdoor IRA.

Anything I'm overlooking here?

venx7s,valoremz,"How to delineate traditional 401k from Mega Backdoor Roth 401k?

I just set up a Mega Backdoor Roth 401K (rather than IRA). I already have a Traditional 401k (maxed out) and Backdoor IRA ($6K a year).

I contributed after-tax funds and then called Fidelity and asked them to do an automatic Roth in-plan conversion of the after tax portion (which would include my most recent after-tax contribution + all future after-tax contributions). All good.

However, the person that I spoke with indicated that a separate Roth 401K account would NOT be created. Rather if I go to my traditional 401K account and click â€œSourcesâ€ I should see a chart that details the portion that is from the Roth conversion. Does that seem right? I was under the impression that there would be a totally separate Roth 401k account for the contributions, but I guess not

How have others handled this in the past? I would like to delineate between my pre-tax 401k and my Mega Backdoor Roth 401k. My concern is when it comes to retirement time - how do I distinguish between my 401k pre-tax contributions and my mega backdoor Roth 401k contributions? Also, if I leave my employer in the future, how do I roll my my mega backdoor Roth 401k contributions into a Roth IRA for example?

Also, rather than converting my after-tax contribution into a Backdoor Roth 401k would it be better to convert to a Backdoor Roth IRA? Would that create a separate account?

Thank you all!",,,,,
wdh7e5,valoremz,"Can employer be under-withholding federal taxes?

My income is 220K and my spouseâ€™s is $350K. We file a joint married tax return each year. On our W4s, we have both put down: single / 0 federal / 0 state withholding. We should be in the 35% percent tax bracket. However, my employer only seems to be withholding 20% federal and my spouse's employer at 25% federal. Based on this, it looks like weâ€™ll owe around $8K to the IRS next year.

[From the NYT](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/12/31/business/electric-cars-germany-economy.html)

Germany relies heavily on internal combustion engine cars for its economy.

Three of the top 5 companies in Germany are (primarily gas) automakers.

While USA auto-maker Tesla started out with electric, we can see from unionized ICE auto-makers in the US, [slowing the transition to electric cars](https://www.wsj.com/articles/gms-electric-ambitions-rattle-below-the-surface-of-the-uaw-strike-11569582003) is a major priority of unions.  Simply put to be competitive in the electric car market it requires a lot less workers and lower wages. Electric cars are just simpler mechanically and require less work to build.

Historically Germany's unions have been adept at reading market conditions and working to create competitive vehicles rather than just maximize wages.

Will union pressure prevent German automakers from competing with companies like Tesla, Rivian, or asian startups?

Will pivoting from gas to electric be an easy task for them even if we take away the pressure of unions?",,,,,

An interesting [article from the wsj](https://www.wsj.com/articles/bayer-strives-to-end-lawsuits-over-roundupwhile-still-selling-it-11581535816?mod=searchresults&amp;page=1&amp;pos=4).

TL;DR: Even if they settle the current lawsuits for only $10b, they could still be liable in the future from cases brought by people buying Roundup today.

&gt; Experts have said Bayer is in an unusual position compared with other companies that have faced multibillion-dollar lawsuits over their products. To end mass-tort litigation, other companies generally have discontinued or altered their products or added warning labelsâ€”all of which are problematic for the German pharmaceutical and agricultural company.

&gt; Bayer is moving closer to a settlement potentially totaling $10 billion ...

&gt; But Bayerâ€™s case is tricky because regulators including the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency have said that glyphosate, the main chemical ingredient in Roundup, doesnâ€™t cause cancer.  ...

&gt;[Bayer](https://quotes.wsj.com/BAYRY) AG [BAYRY](https://quotes.wsj.com/BAYRY?mod=chiclets) is set to announce on Wednesday it struck a roughly $10.5 billion deal to settle tens of thousands of lawsuits with U.S. plaintiffs alleging the companyâ€™s Roundup herbicide causes cancer, a milestone in the German companyâ€™s legal battle that has been weighing down its share price for nearly two years, according to a person familiar with the deal.  
&gt;  
&gt;...  
&gt;  
&gt;Bayer has argued that Roundup is safe and has repeatedly defended the Monsanto deal.  
&gt;  
&gt;As part of the deal with plaintiffsâ€™ attorneys, Bayer will pay some $9.5 billion to settle claims brought by lawyers representing some 95,000 plaintiffs, the person familiar with the matter said. It will set aside an additional roughly $1.1 billion to establish and fund a panel to evaluate whether the product causes cancer to help shape the outcome of future cases.

&amp;#x200B;

Very interesting outcome in the US judicial system.  Both the FDA and European Union consider Roundup safe. Bayer can't even put a warning on the product because of that.

&gt;Bayer AG said it agrees with a move from attorneys representing plaintiffs who sued over the safety of its Roundup weedkiller to withdraw a motion seeking court approval for a plan covering how future claims related to the product would be resolved.  
&gt;  
&gt;That motion is part of [a $10.9 billion settlement](https://www.wsj.com/articles/bayer-reaches-10-5-billion-settlement-over-weedkiller-roundup-11593017309) the German pharmaceutical and agriculture conglomerate reached in June to settle tens of thousands of lawsuits with U.S. plaintiffs who have alleged the Roundup herbicide causes cancer.  
&gt;  
&gt;A spokesman for Bayer confirmed the company agreed with attorneys for the plaintiffs to pull back on the motion. Bayer has said it would set aside $1.25 billion to work toward resolving future claims, which would be guided by conclusions from a court-approved panel of scientists who studied Roundupâ€™s potential carcinogenicity.  
&gt;  
&gt;On Monday, U.S. District Judge Vince Chhabria in San Francisco [said he was skeptical](https://www.wsj.com/articles/judge-questions-bayers-roundup-settlement-plan-11594141993) of Bayerâ€™s plan to capture all future claims tied to Roundup, and would likely reject it.  
&gt;  
&gt;â€œBayer remains strongly committed to a resolution that simultaneously addresses both the current litigation on reasonable terms and a viable solution to manage and resolve potential future litigation,â€ the company said in a statement on Wednesday.

&amp;#x200B;

Bayer really wants to have the lawsuit behind them, so they're willing to do a $10.9 billion settlement to do so.

&amp;#x200B;

However, one of the issues is that Bayer plans to continue to use Roundup because Bayer, the FDA, and EU all claim it is safe.  So they're paying a $10.9 billion settlement for harm done to people who use Roundup, which they is safe.

As part of the deal they wanted to put $1.25 billion towards all future lawsuits.  Part of the $1.25 billion would go towards a court appointed scientific panel that would be used in deciding if Roundup was safe or not for the purposes of future claims.  This would at least make the cost of future litigation known.

However, a judge said that they can't just settle all future claims like that.

hveo3v,VCUBNFO,"European Union Leaders Agree on Spending Plan for Recovery

From the [WSJ](https://www.wsj.com/articles/eu-leaders-close-in-on-coronavirus-recovery-plan-deal-11595274568?mod=hp_lead_pos1)

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;European Union leaders agreed on a â‚¬1.8 trillion ($2.06 trillion) spending package aimed at containing an [unprecedented economic downturn](https://www.wsj.com/articles/eurozone-economy-suffers-record-contraction-steeper-than-u-s-11588242162) by resorting to new measures that could ultimately deepen the blocâ€™s economic integration.  
&gt;  
&gt;The package, built around the blocâ€™s first-ever issuance of hundreds of billions of euros of common debt, came together early Tuesday after four days of talks among the blocâ€™s 27 leadersâ€”the blocâ€™s longest summit in 20 years. German Chancellor Angela Merkel and French President Emmanuel Macron were forced to compromise on what would be spent and how much would be handed out in grants.  
&gt;  
&gt;Leaders ultimately agreed on a â‚¬750 billion recovery plan. Of that, â‚¬390 billion will be offered in grants and the rest will come in the form of loans. That is down from â‚¬500 billion recently proposed by Brussels. The leaders also agreed on a multiyear EU budget of over â‚¬1 trillion that will run from next year to 2027.  
&gt;  
&gt;â€œWe did it. Europe is strong. Europe is united,â€ European Council President Charles Michel, who hosted the summit, said in a press conference Tuesday morning. â€œThese were of course difficult negotiations in very difficult times for all Europeans. This is a good deal. This is a strong deal.â€  
&gt;  
&gt;The agreement represents a significant step in the EUâ€™s move toward a more genuine fiscal union. Some have hailed it as the [blocâ€™s Hamiltonian moment](https://www.wsj.com/articles/hamilton-is-hot-in-europe-the-debt-policy-not-the-musical-11592493271), referring to Alexander Hamilton, the first U.S. Treasury secretary, who had the federal government absorb the debts of U.S. states. Some economists, however, say the cash may only make a modest difference to revive depressed economies.  
&gt;  
&gt;The EU deal will need to be approved by the parliaments of member states, which could prove contentious. Under the recovery plan, the European Commission, the EUâ€™s executive branch, will for the first time issue debt on a large scale to fund grants and loans for countries hit hard by the coronavirus pandemic.  
&gt;  
&gt;The aim is partly to boost Europeâ€™s economic recovery from the new year, while allowing Italy, Spain, Greece and others to increase government spending now without fearing that already high national debt will rise to unsustainable levels.  
&gt;  
&gt;Without the bailout plan, Italyâ€™s national debt risks ballooning to a level that could endanger the euro. Wealthier northern countries decided that helping Rome now was preferable to facing a currency crisis later. The recovery plan grants must be paid out by 2023 and loans allocated by then. Repayments will take place over decades, ending in 2058, leaders agreed.  
&gt;  
&gt;Even with the new agreement, the eurozoneâ€™s economy will shrink by up to 9% this year, according to several estimates, before rebounding somewhat next year. While EU unemployment sparked by the crisis has been abated by government support programs, many economists predict an upsurge later this year as those measures expire.  
&gt;  
&gt;European economies have resumed activity in recent weeks, following a three-month induced coma to squelch the pandemic. But significant portions of the EU economy remain moribund, most notably [tourism and related service businesses](https://www.wsj.com/articles/europes-tourist-hot-spots-suffer-as-u-s-big-spenders-are-told-to-stay-away-11594132862). World-wide [travel bans](https://www.wsj.com/articles/eu-opens-up-to-some-travelers-but-not-americans-11593524652) mean that the normally vast numbers of Asian and American visitors who each summer pump billions of euros into the EU arenâ€™t coming this year, exacerbating woes in Southern European countries reliant on tourism.  
&gt;  
&gt;Alongside the recovery plan, the regular trillion-euro EU budget will pump money into infrastructure and other types of public investment starting next year, while helping the bloc meet its ambitious climate targets. The bloc has already agreed to a â‚¬540 billion coronavirus emergency package of loans to governments and businesses and funding for job-support plans.  
&gt;  
&gt;Tuesdayâ€™s agreement represented a revival of the postwar Franco-German alliance, which had flagged over recent years, with Ms. Merkel having repeatedly rebuffed Mr. Macronâ€™s push for deeper economic integration in the eurozone.  
&gt;  
&gt;â€œI think itâ€™s a very important message to the rest of Europeâ€”but also beyond Europe, that this very special entity, this very special construct of 27 member states of the European Union...is actually able to act together and has proven that it is able to act together,â€ said Ms. Merkel in a press conference alongside Mr. Macron.  
&gt;  
&gt;Yet others expressed disappointment that the planâ€™s ambition was reduced by a group of fiscally conservative countriesâ€”led by the Netherlandsâ€”that had wanted a plan focused around loans, not grants. Those countries argued the plan risked turning the EU into a wealth-transfer union that would bolster domestic euroskeptic opposition and could breach current rules.  
&gt;  
&gt;After the deal was secured Tuesday morning, Dutch Prime Minister Mark Rutte said the recovery plan wouldnâ€™t convert the EU into a wealth-transfer union because the Netherlands and its allies had ensured it was a time-limited, one-off program launched for the health crisis.  
&gt;  
&gt;Meanwhile Italian Prime Minister Giuseppe Conteâ€”who clashed with Mr. Rutte over the size of the grants and the conditions to be attached to loansâ€”said the accord, despite the reduced amount of grants, was a major step forward.  
&gt;  
&gt;â€œWe are satisfied we have launched an ambitious recovery plan,â€ he told reporters. â€œItâ€™s a historic moment for Europe. Itâ€™s a historic moment for Italy.â€  
&gt;  
&gt;Because of the coronavirus, the summit was the first in-person meeting of EU leaders since February. Extensive measures were taken to prevent it from turning into a super-spreading event, but as talks wore on, fatigued leaders put aside social-distancing and mask-wearing instructions in a push for a deal.  
&gt;  
&gt;After a Friday morning start, negotiations nearly broke down that evening. There were tense exchanges after dinner Saturday between France and Germany and the Dutch-led group, and several leaders rounded on Mr. Rutte, the Dutch prime minister, during Sunday nightâ€™s discussions. However, around dawn Monday, an agreement was reached on the amount of grants that should be given under the plan. Once that fight was settled, the rest of the package fell into place.  
&gt;  
&gt;Mr. Rutte also insisted that member states be allowed to hold up payments to other countries if they donâ€™t push economic reform plans. Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban opposed plans to link some EU budget spending to a member countryâ€™s upholding of democratic principles.  
&gt;  
&gt;As in past years, a deal was made possible only after the EU shelved some of its more ambitious, long-term spending plans on issues like the digital economy, security and defense and migration. Despite EU efforts to gradually kill off the special budget repayments enjoyed by a few countries, the final package saw the Netherlands, Sweden, Denmark and Austria walk away with larger so-called rebates.",,,,,

[From the WSJ](https://www.wsj.com/articles/eurozone-economy-contracts-by-record-40-11596191720?mod=hp_lead_pos2)

&gt;Stringent lockdowns weighed heavily on Europeâ€™s economy in the second quarter, causing a record decline that was even more severe than in the U.S., but the continentâ€™s strategy of containment coupled with aggressive stimulus is fanning hopes of a robust recovery.  
&gt;  
&gt;The eurozoneâ€™s gross domestic product fell 40.3% annually in the three months through June, exceeding the U.S. economyâ€™s 32.9% contraction, according to data published Friday. That is by far the sharpest decline since comparable records began in 1995, according to the European Unionâ€™s statistics agency.  
&gt;  
&gt;However, recent statistics suggest Europe is having a â€œmuch bigger snapback and there are some indicators that it may be getting ahead \[of the U.S.\],â€ said Holger Schmieding, chief economist at Berenberg Bank.  
&gt;  
&gt;The U.S. economy is being supported by a massive fiscal stimulus that will likely translate into a 2020 government budget deficit roughly twice as large as Europeâ€™s, Mr. Schmieding added.  
&gt;  
&gt;â€œThe U.S. is paying with fiscal stimulus for its failure to tackle the pandemic decisively,â€ he said.  
&gt;  
&gt;While the U.S. grapples with tens of thousands of new infections each day, Europe has largely brought the virus under control, even as it has eased restrictions and reopened internal borders, notwithstanding an increase in cases in countries such as France and Spain.  
&gt;  
&gt;Confidence appears to be gaining among European consumers and businesses, supported by the billions that governments have lavished on job-protection schemes, aggressive stimulus from the European Central Bank, and a groundbreaking â‚¬1.8 trillion ($2.1 trillion) spending package unveiled by EU leaders last week.  
&gt;  
&gt;The EU stimulus will push up economic growth in Greece, long one of the continentâ€™s weakest performers, by about 2 percentage points a year for the next six years, the countryâ€™s central bank governor, Yannis Stournaras, said.  
&gt;  
&gt;â€œIt was something unexpected, so this is going to have a very positive impact on the Greek economy,â€ Mr. Stournaras said this week.  
&gt;  
&gt;The euro has been on a tear against the dollar in recent weeks, rising close to a two-year high. That reflects both investorsâ€™ confidence in Europe and the U.S.â€™s uneven progress in halting fresh virus infections.  
&gt;  
&gt;â€œThe business in Europe has been and currently is stronger than in the U.S.,â€ BjÃ¸rn Gulden, chief executive of German sports-goods maker Puma SE, told reporters Wednesday. In the U.S., demand has varied widely from state to state, he said.  
&gt;  
&gt;However, analysts at Commerzbank expect the U.S. to remain ahead, with its economy seen contracting by 4.5% for 2020 overall, versus 7% in the eurozone. The U.S. economy will likely grow by 4% in 2021, compared with 5% for the eurozone, they said.  
&gt;  
&gt;Lakshmi Mittal, CEO of ArcelorMittal, the worldâ€™s largest steelmaker, said that according to his order books, the U.S. was pulling slightly ahead.  
&gt;  
&gt;â€œThe U.S. is recovering faster than Europe, we are seeing that from our customer bases,â€ Mr. Mittal said, attributing this primarily to American auto makers.  
&gt;  
&gt;Europe still faces challenges. The region is highly dependent on exports and tourism, neither of which will recover fully until the virus is under control around the world. In Southern Europe, businesses tend to be smaller and more vulnerable, and governments need to service debts that have been inflated by the mammoth costs of containing the pandemic.  
&gt;  
&gt;Borrowing costs have so far been kept in check by aggressive government-bond purchases by the ECB, but central-bank officials have stressed that support is only temporary.  
&gt;  
&gt;Pockets of infection are resurfacing, including in northeastern Spain, dealing a blow to the nationâ€™s large tourism sector. Foreign tourism makes up around 14% of GDP in Greece, 12% in Portugal and 8% in Spain, according to research firm Capital Economics.  
&gt;  
&gt;Tourists are staying away, with occupancy rates of holiday accommodation below 30% in Italy, Greece and Spain. Spain lost one million jobs between April and June, its biggest ever quarterly decline, and the unemployment rate rose to a two-year high of 15.3%, official data indicated Tuesday.  
&gt;  
&gt;That is widening the divide between Europeâ€™s industry-rich North and its poorer South, whose economies had to contend with a worse health crisis, a deeper economic collapse and high debts that deter intensive stimulus. Spainâ€™s economy contracted by 18.5% in the second quarter versus the previous three months, and Italyâ€™s by 12.4%, as Madrid and Rome imposed some of the worldâ€™s strictest lockdowns.  
&gt;  
&gt;Germanyâ€™s economy performed better, shrinking by 10.1%, due to a relatively light lockdown and aggressive government spending.  
&gt;  
&gt;McDonaldâ€™s Corp CEO Chris Kempczinski said Tuesday he saw strong opportunities in Europe, â€œwhere I think there may be some independent restaurant units that are having some bigger challenges.â€  
&gt;  
&gt;He added that: â€œIn many markets around the world, most notably in the U.S., the public-health situation appears to be worsening.â€  
&gt;  
&gt;In France, the EUâ€™s second-largest economy, consumer confidence unexpectedly dropped in July amid signs of a rebound in Covid-19 infections, a monthly survey suggested Wednesday. The French economy contracted by 13.8% in the second quarter versus the previous three months amid weak exports and household consumption, official data showed on Friday.  
&gt;  
&gt;Still, recent French data suggest â€œa V-shaped recovery is on the cards for the third quarter,â€ said Julien Manceaux, an economist with ING Bank.  
&gt;  
&gt;Europeâ€™s governments face a challenge in how to withdraw massive emergency support measures like job-furlough schemes and credit guarantees without hurting the economic recovery. These programs are costly and over time they could keep alive businesses and jobs that should disappear, but governments canâ€™t immediately pull the plug, said Marion Amiot, an economist with S&amp;P Global Ratings in London.  
&gt;  
&gt;But recent mobility data from Google suggest that Europeans are currently more willing to shop than Americans. Some European households have accumulated savings that they can now spend, since many were paid but confined to their homes, said Ms. Amiot.

&gt;Fiat Chrysler Automobiles NV has been ramping up production over the past few months after completely shutting down its factories in mid-March as Italy battled what at the time was the worldâ€™s worst coronavirus outbreak. About three-fourths of employees in production who were working at the end of February are back in the factories. Several of the companyâ€™s large Italian assembly plants, including one in the deep South that produces the Jeep Renegade and Compass as well as the Fiat 500X crossover, are working at full capacity.

[From the WSJ](https://www.wsj.com/articles/lyft-to-suspend-service-in-california-11597942614?mod=hp_lead_pos2)

&gt;[Lyft](https://www.wsj.com/market-data/quotes/LYFT) Inc. LYFT said Thursday[ it will suspend operations in California](https://www.lyft.com/blog/posts/ca-operations-update) as of midnight, to avoid violating an order that requires it to immediately reclassify its drivers as employees.  
&gt;  
&gt;California sued and Lyft and [Uber Technologies](https://www.wsj.com/market-data/quotes/UBER) Inc. in May, alleging they were violating the law, which requires companies to treat workers as employees rather than independent contractors if they are controlled by their employer and contribute to its usual course of business, among other things. As employees, drivers would be eligible for sick days and other benefits, issues that have become more pressing during [the coronavirus pandemic](https://www.wsj.com/news/collection/coronavirus-6dcf2a21).  
&gt;  
&gt;Uber and Lyft, both based in San Francisco, have argued that they are technology platforms connecting riders with drivers, not transportation companies, so the drivers arenâ€™t part of their usual course of business.  
&gt;  
&gt;A state judge agreed with California last week and gave the companies [until Friday to reclassify their drivers](https://www.wsj.com/articles/uber-and-lyft-threaten-california-shutdown-heres-whats-at-stake-11597847808) as employees.

Uber had also previously stated it would suspend operations as well.  Both have said that they'll never be able to provide the same type of service under the new law, even if they do end up returning.

j7zcxx,VCUBNFO,"The German Car Industry Musters for a New Tech Battle

My favorite quote was

&gt;Our customers spend about one hour a day in their car and one hour a day away from their phone. Any car maker who tries to create an ecosystem around the car deserves to lose the customer,â€ says Martin Kristensson, head of digital business at Volvo Cars.

&amp;#x200B;

From the [WSJ](https://www.wsj.com/articles/the-german-car-industry-musters-for-a-new-tech-battle-11602245653?mod=hp_lista_pos3)

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;Is the heart of your car a screen?  
&gt;  
&gt;Having spent yearsâ€”and tens of billions of dollarsâ€”preparing for a shift in production toward electric vehicles, German car makers are expressing a new angst: that digitally â€œconnected carsâ€ could prove even more disruptive to their traditional strengths. This second leg of their race against Tesla could become a fresh excuse to squander investorsâ€™ capital.  
&gt;  
&gt;Daimler set two priorities for technological leadership in a new strategy for its [Mercedes-Benz](https://www.wsj.com/market-data/quotes/DMLRY) [DMLRY **-0.55%** ](https://www.wsj.com/market-data/quotes/DMLRY?mod=chiclets)brand this week: electric drive and car software. For the latter, the company is working on an entire operating system, MB.OS, that from 2024 will run not just Mercedesâ€™s proprietary infotainment system and its mobile broadband connection but also crucial elements of the driving experience, including self-driving features and battery management.  
&gt;  
&gt;The company will partner with technology specialists for specific applications, notably [Nvidia](https://www.wsj.com/market-data/quotes/NVDA) for automated driving. Yet the closer the software gets to the customer experience, the more Daimler wants to do in-house. The interface with the driver in particular â€œis not something that we would like to outsource to somebody else,â€ said Chief Executive Ola KÃ¤llenius.  
&gt;  
&gt;[Volkswagen](https://www.wsj.com/market-data/quotes/XE/XETR/VOW) [VOW **+0.00%** ](https://www.wsj.com/market-data/quotes/XE/XETR/VOW?mod=chiclets)is on a similar road. At last weekâ€™s annual general meeting, Chief Executive Herbert Diess said replacing engines with electric batteries and motors would be simple to manage compared with the transformation of the car into a â€œfully networked mobility device.â€ He is tackling the challenge by investing heavily in coding: VW wants to increase the proportion of software written in-house to at least 60%, from 10% currently, at a cost of â‚¬7 billion, equivalent to $8.23 billion, by 2025.  
&gt;  
&gt;The shadow haunting the German automotive industry is, of course, Tesla. Mr. Diess regularly spurs on his managers by invoking the U.S. companyâ€™s technological lead and astronomical market value. The starring role accorded to the infotainment screen in a Tesla seems to be a popular feature with the kind of tech-loving consumers who might otherwise buy an [Audi](https://www.wsj.com/market-data/quotes/XE/XETR/NSU). Auto makers are also envious of Teslaâ€™s capacity to keep consumersâ€™ systems fresh via â€œover-the-airâ€ updates.  
&gt;  
&gt;One reason Daimler cited for focusing on software was the scope for using this kind of live digital connection with its customers to sell them services well after they have bought their Mercedes-Benz. Many manufacturers have talked of this potential, but Daimler was bold enough to pin a number on it: It hopes to make â‚¬1 billion in operating profit from digital services by 2025.  
&gt;  
&gt;The software industry has been through a wrenching transition over the past decade from selling one-off packages to subscriptions for access to a constantly updated, cloud-hosted service. As more vehicles are connected to the internet, infotainment systems are likely next in line. One big unknown is what consumers will be prepared to pay for, and who will get itâ€”vehicle manufacturers or software developers. Another is how deeply the infotainment system will end up being linked to driving controls.  
&gt;  
&gt;For now, though, most car makers are more relaxed than Daimler and VW about ceding control of at least infotainment to the tech industry. [General Motors](https://www.wsj.com/market-data/quotes/GM), Volvo Cars, the Renault-Nissan-Mitsubishi [alliance](https://www.wsj.com/articles/google-to-partner-with-biggest-car-alliance-1537243260) and [Peugeot](https://www.wsj.com/market-data/quotes/PUGOY) (which [Fiat-Chrysler](https://www.wsj.com/market-data/quotes/FCAU) will likely follow) [all are partnering to varying extents](https://www.wsj.com/articles/gmturns-togooglefor-in-car-apps-voice-commands-11567692000) with Alphabetâ€™s Google, which has developed a vehicle version of its smartphone operating system called Android Automotive.  
&gt;  
&gt;â€œOur customers spend about one hour a day in their car and one hour a day away from their phone. Any car maker who tries to create an ecosystem around the car deserves to lose the customer,â€ says Martin Kristensson, head of digital business at Volvo Cars.  
&gt;  
&gt;Volvo and others say partnering with Google makes sense because consumers already use and like its products. The glitchy reputation of auto makersâ€™ existing vehicle infotainment systems adds weight to this argument. But partnering also is probably the cheaper option.  
&gt;  
&gt;â€œThere are a lot of economies of scale in software development. Auto makers who want to get more programmers and do the work themselves are generally underestimating the costs,â€ says Mark Wakefield, co-leader of the automotive and industrial practice at AlixPartners.  
&gt;  
&gt;The insistence of Daimler and VW on building up software skills might therefore be another iteration of their historic bias toward over-investment. The vast expense of electric-vehicle development has forced both companies to get more serious about cutting fixed costs in recent years; Mercedes-Benz this week committed to a 20% reduction by 2025. Ominously, though, the company also is charging into yet another technological battleground.  
&gt;  
&gt;Drivers and investors alike may end up preferring auto makers to focus on what they are best at: assembling cars.

&amp;#x200B;

Google makes the operating system that is in the majority of the world's phones.  The idea that VW is going to be able to really compete with that just doesn't make sense. Especially when their history of tech is pretty much a failure.

&amp;#x200B;

I don't think that the German automotive industry is going to be near the same in 10 years.  I wonder how that is going to impact Germany and Europe's overall economy.",,,,,

So, long story short, I was talking to a relative about having 1 checking account and 1 savings account with the same large bank. The bank I use is a large chain bank available across the country.

Apparently even if a national bank has proper insurance each individual branch can opt out and that is what happened to him.

I am one of those people who has pretty much not enjoyed life very much because I save and invest heavily.

Total current net worth at age 29: $115,360 

I have an old beater car that probably has a year left in her. Would it be financially wrong to buy a brand new car even if it was a cheaper new car like a Toyota Corolla or Honda Accord? I would like to have a brand new car, pay off $5,000 of it for down payment the day I drive off the lot and just not have to worry about engine, power steering, transmission, brake problems for at least 2 to 3 years after purchase. The only thing holding me back from buying a brand new car is that after title, tax, etc I would take a hit of at least $24k from my net worth of $115,360. 

I am on here more of asking not only about buying a brand new car but also asking what should be done about my investments? Each of those 3 brokerage accounts I go with because each of them offers something the other one cannot offer. Furthermore in each of them I take different investment techniques and like them separate also for that reason. Brokerage 1 I use just to buy up ETFs that I will hold until retirement and also pay dividends that are reinvested like VOO and SCHD. Brokerage 2 is for stocks only and is for buying S&amp;P 500 stocks that I feel are undervalued. Brokerage 3 is for my tech stocks and also Nasdaq ETFs, which are more volatile than the broader market. Would it be wise to open a ROTH IRA and pump money into it every year to the max? For example I get a tax refund most years of $2k-$3k and would love to just shovel that money each year into the ROTH IRA. I talked to my parents about my net worth and they both said to just pump as much as I can into the Deferred Compensation account because compound interest will take over after I hit $60k in a few years and compound interest will start contributing more to the account than even I will be able to.

I will summarize my situation the best I can. I am a 27 yo single gay man (so kids are not going to happen by accident) living with a relative for cheap (rent is $300 a month - pay for my own food/gas for car, etc). 

I currently have approx. $8k in the bank. I have a small amount of money in cryptocurrencies (planning on holding for the long term) and approx. $4k in mid/large cap stocks (also planning on holding for the long term). I have approx. $11k in student loans right now (graduated with a BA in the field I work in, graduated in 2016). 

I am trying to get my financial life as organized as I can. I listen to people like Dave Ramsey, but much of their advice is geared towards people who eventually will have kids (hence the reason for baby step 5 which is to save for your kids college fund). A lot of financial experts like Dave Ramsey say a person should pay off all of their debt before building an emergency fund and/or investing. The issue is I did not know who Dave Ramsey was until right now and am not sure if I should pay off my student loans since there is a good probability $10k of student loans will be forgiven in the future 2 years?

Currently make approx. $48k a year, working in public sector full time with benefits.

Every single paycheck for the past several months I have been putting $500 into a mutual fund through work. My ultimate goal is to have approx. $35k in it by the time I reach age 29 in a few years, and then I can completely stop investing in it and just let the compound interest take me to several hundred thousand by the time I am retirement age (between age 50 to age 62).

The main reason I do not want to pay off my debt today is because I want to always have a 4 month emergency fund, and I want to keep on pace to hit the $35k goal by age 29 as planned. Plus, if I had to guess, I would say student loans will be forgiven in some portion (most likely $10k per student loan borrower). That would leave me with just $1k in loans to pay back (which I would do ASAP). 

After I reach the $35k in the mutual fund I will then build up a bigger emergency fund (to $15k) then will either a) get my own cheap apartment or b) save up a large amount of money for my own home. 

If you were me in your late 20s what would you do differently? Would you not take the risk with the student loans maybe being forgiven and just pay them all off ASAP?",,,,,

xqfjcz,Versace__01,"How much available credit should someone 29 yo have?

Came to the personal finance pros on this sub to help me answer this question. I do not have friends I can talk to about this kind of stuff. I likewise do not have relatives I can talk to about all this because I came from poverty and they do not have the ability to obtain a credit card because of having horrible credit... 

I am 28, single and no kids. I live with a relative very cheap to try to save up money to pay for the down payment on a house. I have 7 credit cards, and the total available credit on all if I was to consolidate would be $48,550. After doing a little research I discovered that this is somewhat high, in fact very high for my age. My distant friend who I had talked about this with many years ago only had a line of credit through their bank but no credit cards. 

The reason I have the credit cards depends on which one I talk about. My Discover is needed to buy groceries at my local grocery store because it is the only method of payment it accepts besides cash. My American Express gets me 3% cash back on all gas purchases. I pay off the balances every month. In fact I was considering getting 2 more credit cards within the next year simply because I like what they have to offer... It should be noted then my available credit on all credit cards would be close to $60 in available credit. Is that a little high for someone who is 29?",,,,,

I am a 29 yo. I am currently single, but have found a person I would like to start a relationship with. I want to someday move away from rural America and move to a more urban area. I have lived with a relative since graduating college 6 years ago. That relative is going into a nursing home next year in the summer of 2023. I am going to want to move to a more urban area. The cost of living in urban America is of course about 40-90% higher than in rural America. I currently have $10k in savings. I also have approx. $20k in several different brokerage accounts. I also have approx. $60k in my retirement account at work (I cannot withdraw this money unless I am retirement age). I have no debts right now. 

How much should I save up between now and August 2022, which is when I plan to move to urban America? I would probably want to live alone for 1 year before having any partner move in with me. The rent for a studio where I want to live (Milwaukee) hovers around $1,400 in rent. 

I bring home a net pay of $2,800 where I work now. It is important to note that where I work has several locations and I can easily land a job in Milwaukee making approx. $2,800 doing what I do now for the same company.

I work for the government as a full time employee. The area I work in there is as much overtime as you want. There are locations all over the state I live in, both urban and rural. Also, there is a lot of upward mobility. I have been a base level employee since graduating from college in 2016. Immediately after college I had no money and moved in with my grandmother. 
Since 2016 I have lived with my grandmother. What was originally going to be just a few months of living with her turned into just over 6.5 years as of right now. I was going to move out in 2018 because I was financially prepared with a 6 month emergency fund, and plenty of money to spare. My grandmother broke down and began to cry when I told her I was viewing apartments. I ended up staying with her. I do do a lot of work around her house and since she is single, 84 yo and owns a medium sized home I decided to stay. 
It is now 2022, soon to be 2023. I am 29. I have a net worth of $95k. I want to start dating. I want to move to an urban area. I want to have my own apartment. I have relatives telling me different things. I have 2 aunts who have told me â€œhow dare I not wait for grandma to pass away of natural causes to move out.â€ I have a stepmom telling me â€œGet your own place in the same city as grandma but still help with chores at her place.â€ I have a dad and cousins telling me â€œMove away. You deserve it. Go meet new people.â€ 
There are pros and cons of either decision. Grandma has money but I still pay her rent ($300/month) and I buy my own groceries, do my own laundry, etc. I bring home $3,100 a month take home. Car is paid off, but will need replacement in a few years. My current budget after auto insurance, food, iPhone, gas, life insurance, gym membership, etc leaves me with $1,850 a month. The area I want to move to has an average 1 bedroom rent of $1,100. Utilities/internet would cost $320 a month. It still leaves play money, it even leaves room for a used car payment. If I was to move I would likewise promote and take home an additional $320 a month.

17hui7k,waltwhitman83,"Why do you think the S&P is down 10.5% in the past 3 months?

SPY was $457.79 on July 31st. Today on October 27th, it is ~$410.

The market usually reacts to multiple things:

* geopolitical events 

* data from reports (GDP, CPI, employment, etc.)

* data from earnings from companies

* emotions

* the rate of alternative investments (like bonds/treasuries or money-market funds that react to the federal funds rate)

As far as I can tell, earnings from big companies have been good and not catastrophic.

CPI is ""ok""

Employment is showing the labor market is resilient + resistant to what the Federal Reserve is trying to achieve (stop inflation) which is interesting because it conflicts with their dual mandate of maximum employment.

In my opinion, the market is reacting to the realization that the economy is resilient enough to withstand the federal funds rate being ~4-5%, which means the Fed will continue to make data driven decisions that will result in higher for longer. As an estimate, we could argue we hypothetically won't see the Fed do any rate cuts whatsoever in the next 12 months.

What I don't get is... why all of a sudden? The market topped at $457 right around the time of the last FOMC meeting. I remember the updated dot plot projections came out from the Federal Reserve that showed ""higher for longer"" and basically kicked off this selloff. What I don't get is... why is it still happening and why at this rate? Is that really the sole catalyst or is something else happening I'm not aware of. I'm aware that the higher the 10 year (risk free rate) creeps, the worse it is for equities in the next 1 to 5 years.

If this isn't the sole reason the market is down 10%, I feel like I personally (a ""retail"" investor with information available to me basically only through whatever is on the public, free, open Internet) have no clue why the market is reacting the way it is. What is the catalyst?

I was told from a friend that this is how some of the ultra-wealthy are generating income (enough to live off of) while avoiding taxes of any kind (capital gains or income)

A quick Google shows UBS, Merrill Lynch, eTrade, and Morgan Stanley all offer some way for you to borrow at least 50% of the value of your equities for around 2% or less.

I'm guessing the flow is:

1. Have $1m-$10m in equities (you can do it with less but I'd imagine it isn't worth it)

2. Take an SBLOC of 50% of the value at 2%

3. Live your life (spend $400k-$1m/yr doing whatever it is rich people do)

4. Pay the interest back every year, keep receiving dividends, never sell any of your equities until it is time to have repaid the loan / you ran out of cash (say every 5 years), and since then your stocks have grown so you never really have less than the original number you started with equity wise

Disclaimer: I'm 99% sure you can't receive dividends while using margin from any broker (they keep them until the loan is paid back), so... this is all just for fun/""what if"". I came up with this plan as a joke with a friend talking about how crazy interest rates are these days.

1. amass $1.5m in cash/equities by like 40
2. deposit it in a M1 Finance Plus brokerage account
3. take out 2x leverage at 2% margin rate. buying power is $3m now
4. put it all into HYG (iShares iBoxx $ High Yield Corporate Bond ETF), yield is 4%, covid crash was 20% drawdown
5. collect $120k/yr in qualified dividends
6. owe about $10k in taxes (single filer, $12.2k standard deduction, first $40k in dividends is taxed at 0%)
7. owe about $30k/yr in margin interest
8. $80k/yr to spend

qntl33,waltwhitman83,"Why does every car manufacturer go with CATL for their EV batteries instead of PCFRY?

My friend is taking a big bet on Panasonic, even though only 20% of their current revenue is related to batteries.

It seems Tesla has them by the balls (Panasonic is set up inside Teslaâ€™s factory, sounds like an intellectual process nightmare)

It also seems Tesla is looking to make batteries themselves. Could this not spell doom for Panasonic? They seem to attract near 0 other car EV customers.

BMW, VAG, MB, they all seem to go CATL.

qwfn97,waltwhitman83,"How much longer can the market keep going up under the premise of ""it's because of the low interest rate environment""?

I can't think of any good reason for the market to pullback in some kind of ""fiery crash"" 15%, but I also don't understand why the market is up 37% from it's pre-covid highs and why it continues to keep climbing at the rate it's climbing. 

I know there's a ton of people with a lot of money (in my mind, this group that people vaguely allude to all of the time as pent up money on the sidelines has to be typically families making $250k/yr+, no?) chasing returns. There's nowhere else to park money, I get it. I'm just asking... when is that going to stop being the answer? 

When are people going to run out of cash to deploy? How many people are really buying in at these levels weekly with any sizable volume? I get it, everybody here is dollar-cost-averaging $500/mo into their 401k irregardless and they want a badge of honor on how they ignore the market and are sticking to their great 30 year long investment plan. Amazing. Congratulations. My question is... is that's what is driving the market up 40% in 14 months? Regular John Smith's 401k on his $120k/yr salary? I doubt it.

I thought on a good year, when earnings beat estimates and forecasts were positive and not revised downward, we could reliably expect companies to grow so much that overall the market averages 10% of growth before inflation.

How the heck are we up 39% from August 2020 to now? Are the 505 companies inside of the S&amp;P 39% more profitable/forward looking than they were then? 

The money the Fed printed for stimulus + CoVID relief... has it left the ""banking"" system? It went fed -&gt; banks. Are the banks lending it out? If not... I know that money ""exists"" on paper but... is it really in circulation? Who got it and who spent it?",,,,,

I wanted to validate that I'm not totally wrong in thinking:

right now, nobody wants bonds. not thousandires, not millionaires, not billionaires with tons of cash to park who just want to earn a few bucks (hedge against inflation) and forget about it. the yields are too low and unattractive. real estate also has its own issues, crypto, etc. equities are currently *the* answer on where to park cash for the time being. with that said:

the 20 year bond is sitting around 2%

if the federal reserve changes the base lending interest rate from 0-0.25% (which is what it is at now) to 0.25-0.50% (which is the most likely occurence we're going to see monetary policy wise) within the next 12-18 months, what does that do to the 20 year treasury bond for example? does it go up 0.25bps?",,,,,
r7irbb,waltwhitman83,"When is it worth it to diversify $8m into commercial real estate instead of being 100% allocated in the market? 5.6% cap rate

Hypothetical: net worth $100m-$250m

(please spare me the point where somebody chimes in and the top voted comment is ""go see a financial advisor"". no duh. common sense. this is just hypothetical/to prove a point in a unique situation. if anything, i'm saying, hey r/investing, let's pretend to be financial advisors and see how well we would do in this context)

You already have a ton of exposure to stocks. ETFs/mutual funds, track the index, yada yada.

If you can pull in ~$620k/yr gross, $450k/yr net (25% operating expenses), write off 2.2% depreciation of the purchase price from 5 years ago (about $3.7m-$4.5m), and also benefit from the compounding appreciation of roughly 3% a year on $8m ($240k/yr the first year)... does this make sense?

Context: the buildings are paid off. No financing/mortgage/interest.

I am not sure if this is wrong but... running a cap rate calculator based on the *current* market value of the properties is 5.6%.

To me... that's bad. But is this all an example of how ""what you read online doesn't really apply all of the time/it depends on other factors"". You could do better by *not* being a landlord, not having tenants, not having to maintain buildings, sell the buildings for $8m, clear $7m after fees/closing costs, and put it in the market at 10% (before inflation).

But... is this proof that... high net worth individuals are willing to take ""less return"" in the name of diversification?

I would say the returns are relatively neck-and-neck when you take into account tax deductions (net about $30k in the 37% bracket), appreciation added to net income (another $240k on top in appreciation of $450k is a big deal. That's generating almost $700,000/yr net on $8m in capital being tied up, plus the $30k in tax deductions makes it about $730k/yr).

Is it a no brainer to do commercial real estate instead of stocks in this case? Am I reading too heavily into ""5.6% cap rate is bad"". Is cap rate for people who don't have the buildings paid off? Could I (in this hypothetical situation) command higher rent given the cap rate? Is cap rate supposed to be on purchase price, not market value?",,,,,

rmirc9,waltwhitman83,"Is inflation good for equities because there are no alternatives for return-seeking cash or is inflation bad for equities because increased costs will eat into profit margins?

What's the overall verdict? I'm sure the answer lies in the middle.

Having to pay employees more (at corporations/companies who do attempt to give cost of living raises) and having your entire supply chain cost more is a problem. Can you pass 100% of the inflation-related expenses on to your consumers? I don't know.

Sometimes the market goes up, up, up and the advice passed around here is ""billions of dollars need return! bonds too low, inflation good!""

Then the market goes down and we get news articles about fears of inflation.

Inflation is here. We're like 38% higher than we were on 02/14/2020 (right before COVID crash) on the S&amp;P. $337 -&gt; $467 on SPY. Far more than the typical 7-10% we see touted around these forums. It hasn't caused the market to stop climbing yet.",,,,,

sebgj6,waltwhitman83,"Why should the market go back to 4800 versus why should the market go to 3800 and below

Let's make a pros and cons list.

Pro = let's get out of this 10% correction and go back to bull market where we slowly set new all time highs week after week

Con = 10% correction roughly, what are reasons we are due for another 10% drop and then some?

Disclaimer: I'm not going to ""trade"" or ""change my investment"" strategy based on any of this. It's just for fun/knowledge transfer/learning new perspectives in the community.

A few weeks ago, the market decided a 37x P/E was ok. Then some new data/news came in and consensus changed and now we're hovering at a 25x P/E. Will we head back to the mean of 16x? What will it take for the market to justify a 37x P/E again? What's stopping us from heading to a 20x P/E?

https://www.multpl.com/s-p-500-pe-ratio

List anything you can think of. 

Cons:

* Fed funding rate increasing from 0.25% to 1.25% within the next 18 months

* inflation eating into profit margins/amount of free cash consumers have

* lingering long term effects of rampant money printing that happened past 18 months

* Fed announcing MBS purchases/QE coming to an end

* national debt is high

* productivity losses due to newly remote-first workforce

* labor shortage influencing how many projects companies can get done

* supply chain/chip shortages making business difficult

* CoVID restrictions/lockdowns/waves/variants

* geopolitical tensions like Ukraine/Russia, Taiwan/China

* mid-term elections coming up in US

* US housing market is broken in many areas due to increased demand and lowered supply

Pros:

* Real GDP growth was reported strong

* Everything was fine as of January 4th (according to the market at least)

* some people have lots of cash sitting on the sidelines pent up from not being able to go anywhere during pandemic/just having all of their assets appreciate with inflation, etc.

* CoVID coming to an end

* strong job market

* companies might report strong earnings from increased sales during Q4 2020 of pandemic",,,,,
slztfh,waltwhitman83,"Whatâ€™s the current bull case?

As interest rates rise in the future, earnings of the companies that make up the index will most likely fall (since access to cheap capital going forward will slowly erode)

If companies earn less and grow less, they are typically worth less.

With all of this â€œknownâ€ and â€œpriced inâ€ data, whatâ€™s the case for the S&amp;P to reach back to its all time high of 4800, and then continue growing onwards to 5000 and beyond?

Most of the people I interact with in terms of investment discussions seem to be â€œcalling forâ€ an upcoming and overdue global recession. Thereâ€™s a non-zero amount of data out there to build this argument/case.

Whatâ€™s the counter data to defend the bull case?",,,,,
teuhlf,waltwhitman83,"What are the chances S&amp;P500 index sees 3800 this year?

Sorry if this post is stupid. I know macroeconomic predictions are stupid but I also feel that this sort of falls closer to ""long term investing"" than it does ""daytrading/swing trading/momentum trading/technical analysis/guessing when + where the market is going at a micro level"".

We opened the year 4796 and we're at 4242, a 554 point/11.5% drop

To get to 3800 would be another 442 points downwards, which is 10% from where we are now (would be 20.7% overall)

We all knew that with the fed raising interest rates, stock valuations were due to come down. More expensive debt (if the company is using leverage/debt to grow, which most are?) = more revenue/income/cash flow spent on servicing debt = less profits posted each quarter = lower EPS. According to https://www.cmegroup.com/trading/interest-rates/countdown-to-fomc.html, we will most likely see interest rates be within the range of 1.5% - 2.25% by December 2022. 

Oil seems to have come back down almost to pre-Russia/Ukraine war numbers. Light crude oil futures (CL1!) were at $92/barrel on February 24th. Currently sitting around $98 (down from their highs of $123). About a 6.5% increase. Granted, $92 wasn't a great price either, with oil mainly trading between $65-$85 for the year prior. If oil stays high... that's obviously an issue since it is responsible for so much of how the global economy works. 

Rising interest rates, high oil prices eating into consumer spending power, inflation as a whole eating into consumer spending power, geopolitical conflict in Ukraine/Russia, fed slowly tapering the amount of bond/MBS purchasing they have been doing to remove the extra liquidity + ""artificial propping up of value"" from those markets, residential real estate home supply crunch keeping most regular people away from being able to purchase a home, therefore increasing demand for rent, increasing rental prices as well.

If this subreddit allowed polls, I'd do a poll. What are the chances the markets hit 3800? A geopolitical war in Ukraine/Russia got us 11%... my thinking is... that's it? Is the worst of it behind us? Will the markets keep trending/ticking higher like they always have?",,,,,
tjpdnx,waltwhitman83,"Why is the Federal Reserve raising interest rates going to lower inflation?

fed raising interest rates: forces businesses/corporations who are looking to continue financing growth through debt/loans spend more due to higher interest rates, aka less free cash flow (since it will cost more to service any new loans going forward) aka less money to hire people with, give bonuses/raises, reinvest into the company, etc.

how does this slow inflation, which is mainly driven by supply constraints + commodity prices?",,,,,
tl2ert,waltwhitman83,"What is Ray Dalio trying to say in his new 43 minute video ""Principles for Dealing with the Changing World Order""?

1. He believes what is currently happening in America is not new. We were a previously untested global economic superpower but we are slowly losing our dominance to China, just how countries in the past did.

2. We are losing our dominance to China because we over-exerted our status at the world reserve currency because we printed too much money, just like other countries in the past did, giving China an opportunity to rise.

What do others here think about his short film?",,,,,
tsirle,waltwhitman83,"What's a semi-accurate best guess on what parties are responsible (and at what % of volume) for the roughly 1-2b shares of SPY traded monthly on average?

Obviously we will never know EXACTLY who/what traded every share.

But I'm curious if we have any data available to us that can help us understand the markets better.

BlackRock has IVV, Vanguard has VOO. From what I can tell, SPY is managed by State Street Global Advisors.

I know the options chain is obviously part of a certain % of volume (probably a small one) because puts/calls getting exercised will always trigger shares trading hands... right? I can only imagine the complexity of the SPY options chain and won't pretend to understand even a fraction of it. The only question I have is... is it responsible for 90m shares trading a day alone? Probably a not.

I don't think a lot of 401ks or pensions or any other retirement accounts where average Americans dollar-cost-average a portion of their paycheck income/savings end up in SPY. That takes out ""institutional investing"" into SPY, right? If not... what institutions are buying SPY? What product are they offering on top of it, and to who? How large are they? Why wouldn't their customers just buy SPY themselves?

I don't think retail traders/retail day traders/retail swing traders/anything retail are a huge % of the market when speaking about a daily volume perspective. I don't know how big the retail trading market is (on a daily or weekly or monthly scale) but I'd love to learn more. I'm going to guess it's 5-20% of daily volume, being extremely generous. I agree that it's asinine to even think retail is responsible for 20% of daily volume but... I literally can't even estimate/guess/come up with a hypothesis on where the other 95% of the daily volume from SPY comes from. 

Do other asset management companies (who aren't big enough to have their own S&amp;P ETF offerings) charge their clients a fee to put their money in SPY for them behind the scenes, and they are daily rebalancing? Is that where some of the volume comes from?

I know a lot of algorithms are fighting each other for fractions of a penny all day at rapid speed, shaving nanoseconds off and frontrunning buy/sell orders from Robinhood (and others) to make money at scale. But... they can't just trade in between each other all day, can they? Like... there are only so many Robinhood buyers, and all of their volume isn't going to SPY... If ""market makers"" are behind the majority of volume because they are providing liquidity, who are the buyers and sellers on each side? We already determined the majority is not retail, not institutions since they would be targeting mutual funds instead of the ETF.

The market is open from 9:30am -&gt; 4:00pm (6.5 hours, 23.4k seconds). If you ignore pre-market and after-hours (not sure what % of daily volume these two trading windows are responsible for, I'm going to guess less than 10%), you're talking about roughly 2b shares traded in a 21 day window, roughly 95.2m shares per day, just over 4,070 shares a second. What parties are buying and selling 4k shares a second every second of every trading day on average for the entire year on average?

&gt; According to a 2017 JPMorgan analysis, passive investors like ETFs and quantitative investment accounts, which utilize high-frequency algorithmic trading, were responsible for about 60 percent of overall trading volumes while ""fundamental discretionary traders"" (or traders who evaluate the fundamental factors affecting a stock before making an investment) comprised only 10 percent of the overall figures.

tth665,waltwhitman83,"Let's peel apart the February 2022 7.9% CPI measurement to figure out if the data shows ""it's because the fed printed money""

Stuff in 2021 cost 7.9% less than it did in 2022. Let's investigate:

&gt; The CPI-U is a more general index and seeks to track retail prices as they affect all urban consumers. It encompasses about 87 percent of the United States' population. The CPI-W is a more specialized index and seeks to track retail prices as they affect urban hourly wage earners and clerical workers.

&gt; The three largest components of the CPI are housing, transportation, and food/beverages in that order.

&gt; They are weighted this way: housing 41.4%; food and beverages 17.4%; transport 17.0%; medical care 6.9%; apparel 6.0%; recreation 4.4%; other 6.9%. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consumer_price_index

How much is each category up?

    Housing (CPIHOSNS): 275.13 -&gt; 291.50 (5.95%)
    Food and beverages (CPIUFDSL): 271.42 -&gt; 292.91 (7.9%)
    Transport (CPITRNSL): 211.47 -&gt; 256.02 (21.06%)
    Medical care (CPIMEDSL): 523.03 -&gt; 535.73 (2.43%)
    Apparel (CPIAPPSL): 118.53 -&gt; 126.34 (6.59%)
    Recreation (CPIRECSL): 122.89 -&gt; 128.97 (4.97%)
    Other (CPIOGSSL): 469.88 -&gt; 496.04 (5.57%)

2021: (41.4Ã—275.13+17.4Ã—271.42+17Ã—211.47+6.9Ã—523.03+6Ã—118.53+4.4Ã—122.89+6.9Ã—469.88) / (41.4+17.4+17+6.9+6+4.4+6.9) = 278.11055

2022: (41.4Ã—291.50+17.4Ã—292.91+17Ã—256.02+6.9Ã—535.73+6Ã—126.34+4.4Ã—128.97+6.9Ã—496.04) / (41.4+17.4+17+6.9+6+4.4+6.9) = 299.61795

My weights are a little outdated/off but the math checks out: about 7.7% increase 2021 -&gt; 2022

Now let's dive into some of the categories. A lot of people say CPI is a shitty metric that doesn't capture the ""true"" inflation Americans are experiencing. I've read countless times on Reddit how the entire formula is set up in a way to hide ""real inflation"" from the American people.

Here are the same categories, sorted by how much they are up year over year:

    (21.06%) Transport (CPITRNSL): 211.47 -&gt; 256.02 
    (7.9%) Food and beverages (CPIUFDSL): 271.42 -&gt; 292.91  
    (6.59%) Apparel (CPIAPPSL): 118.53 -&gt; 126.34  
    (5.95%) Housing (CPIHOSNS): 275.13 -&gt; 291.50  
    (5.57%) Other (CPIOGSSL): 469.88 -&gt; 496.04 
    (4.97%) Recreation (CPIRECSL): 122.89 -&gt; 128.97  
    (2.43%) Medical care (CPIMEDSL): 523.03 -&gt; 535.73  

Obviously, housing matters more to people than apparel. Keep in mind the transport category is what holds gasoline prices, and this was a reading before the Ukraine-Russia conflict if I remember correctly.

March 2022 CPI will be released Apr. 12, 2022.

Drilling in a bit more, here are some categories. The weights might be slightly out of date, since the page says it is from 2020. https://www.bls.gov/cpi/tables/relative-importance/2020.htm The categories are up to 8 tiers nested.

ultmzk,waltwhitman83,"At what level will we see capitulation?

Buying the CoVID flash crash of 2020 turned out to (at least shortly after) be a really good dip buying opportunity.

everybody seems to know how much the Fed will do quantitive tightening per month, but nobody seems to be aware of any of their targets long-term. For example, we donâ€™t know if theyâ€™ll be able to keep the course of unwinding $100 billion a month for six months, eight months, 12 months, 60 months.

their balance sheet was a little bit below $4 trillion before the pandemic, and itâ€™s now currently closer to 9 trillion. Thereâ€™s no data to prove this but Iâ€™m going to guess the Fed obviously has a desire to lower their balance sheet, and pre-pandemic levels could potentially be a good target. Meaning they have to unroll about $5 trillion, which at current rates would take about 50 months.

there is nothing that states all stock market price discovery should break over this. Thereâ€™s nothing to say that companies will not make and grow earnings.

However, weâ€™re obviously going through what seems like a correction. The joke around this sub has always been, if too many people are buying weâ€™re at the top, and when people start making posts like this, we should be closer to the bottom.

all jokes aside since Iâ€™m not really interested in calling bottoms or timing or anything like that, Iâ€™m just curious where a â€œsaneâ€ level of â€œdowntrendâ€ makes sense.

do we revert to the mean of 15x P/E? iâ€™m not exactly sure what price that puts us at. I will do the math later. that would be with trailing 12 month earnings, and if 20% of the companies in the S&amp;P (random number) fail to grow or even start to go backwards earnings wise, the valuation projection quickly becomes useless.

this form really hates to say numbers. They love by the dip. I love by the dip. I see how time in the market works. Iâ€™m not trying to time any markets.

just trying to have a conversation on what some eye opening numbers would be if you were to see them flash across your screen from a bottom prescriptive.

3800? 3500? 3300? 3000? S&amp;P",,,,,
v2m553,waltwhitman83,"At what deb-to-GDP level will the USA be negatively impacted enough that it affects the economy/stock market?

https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/GFDEGDQ188S

Currently 125%

Started being above 100% since 2012

Used to be sub 65% for most time before 2008

I'm well aware that ""it'll be a problem when the country can't afford to repay the interest"". I don't know how much we pay yearly in terms of... how much goes to interest, how much goes to principal. How far are we from not being able to repay just the interest? Japan has 200%. Could we sustain 200% without isuses?

&gt; Japanâ€™s ratio at the end of 2019 was higher: about 200%, according to data from the Bank of Japan and Japanâ€™s Ministry of Foreign Affairs and calculations by St. Louis Fed Economist Miguel Faria-e-Castro.

https://www.stlouisfed.org/open-vault/2020/october/debt-gdp-ratio-how-high-too-high-it-depends

I know most of debt is owned by the ""public"".

&gt; The public holds over $22 trillion of the national debt.3 Foreign governments hold a large portion of the public debt, while the rest is owned by U.S. banks and investors, the Federal Reserve, state and local governments, mutual funds, pensions funds, insurance companies, and holders of savings bonds.

https://www.thebalance.com/who-owns-the-u-s-national-debt-3306124#:~:text=The%20public%20holds%20over%20%2422,and%20holders%20of%20savings%20bonds.

I don't understand the full mechanism on how... the federal government runs at least a $1t-$2t deficit yearly based on current trends of budgeting. They take on debt by issuing bonds. I don't know what ""open market"" they put these bonds up for sale on. 

&gt; https://www.statista.com/statistics/246420/major-foreign-holders-of-us-treasury-debt/#:~:text=Foreign%20holders%20of%20United%20States%20treasury%20debt&amp;text=Of%20the%20total%207.55%20trillion,1.3%20trillion%20U.S.%20dollars%20worth.

I know Japan/China buy up some bonds (foreign countries hold $7.5t of $30t). Not really sure domestically where the money goes/comes from. When the government is $1t short on spending vs tax income, they issue a bond. To who? Then, they domestically turn around and buy the same bond? Can you call that printed money a la federal reserve? I have to be misunderstanding something so please feel free to fill me in. I tried Googling to figure out this answer but have been coming up short.

That rabbit hole aside, can we slowly creep up to 200% debt-to-GDP like Japan without issue? Will we ever get down below 100% again?",,,,,

I feel this data fights the narrative of ""nobody can afford rent, $5/gallon gas is killing the consumer and bleeding into the cost of everything else they buy (food)""

Which is it?

vdvlvc,waltwhitman83,"Why are oil prices high if the Russia/Ukraine war just shuffled around the supply/demand dynamic globally?

Before the invasion, US + EU + UK + Australia + ""whoever else decided to move off of Russian oil for moral reasons"" used to get oil (partially) from Russia.

I don't know what China/India did before the Russian/Ukranian invasion. A blend of various nations I'm sure, just like any other country. The narrative being passed around is currently ""they purchased less oil from Russia than compared to now"". 

If all we did (the US + ""morally upstanding countries"") was (partially) move our supplier from Russia to Saudis (or whoever could fill the gap in demand), and all China + India did was move their supplier from Saudis to Russia (giving Saudis more supply to sell it us), where is the actual shift in the overall supply/demand that is driving gas to be elevated?

Let's assume demand is/has been relatively constant (if anything it's declining because people are driving less now that it's high but that's irrelevant in my opinion).

Let's assume zero countries can magically flip a switch and come up with more supply (they don't want to for profitability reasons/they literally can't do it on a dime).

I'm well aware that nobody would want to invest short term (1-5 years) in oil because the current macroeconomic picture is a world that at least attempts to move away from fossil fuels in the name of climate change concerns/a hope for an Earth with less global ""pollution"" / ""greenhouse gases"".

It's no secret that it's extremely easy to lose money when it comes to investing. By thinking you're smarter than the average bear and doing things like:

* try to pick individual stocks that don't beat S&amp;P when it comes to drawdown/return other than say... some of the best tech stocks of the past 10-20 years

* introducing leverage/margin into a buy and hold strategy

* trying to time the market/do things like investing in an ETF that shorts the market when you 'think' it's going down

* trying to trade options/buy calls/puts and hope that you get the timing right and sell the increase in premium/IV but instead get caught in the wrong trade and have them expire worthless/near worthless on you

* trying to trade things like commodities/forex

* trying to trade things like futures (which move $50 for 1 SPX point directionally on /ES)

* trying to draw trend lines/support/resistance/thinking you can accurately predict price movement based on patterns/history/wedges/candlestick patterns

* use one of thousands of indicators like RSI/MACD/Bollinger Bands to try and suggest good entry/exit prices

* try to make money by investing in currencies/crypto/random countries

There's obviously at least some market for ""Quantitative Algorithmic Trading Jobs""

I'm just curious, how much of this is publicly accessible? There's SPY and IVV and VOO and VTI. People eat those up and love them.

Why wouldn't people love access to an ETF that supposedly beats buy and hold through technical analysis/quantitive analysis/anything? A company offering that could potentially rake in lots of money. If the answer is ""very few of them beat buy and hold"", why is the industry as big as it is? If you google ""does technical analysis actually work"", https://www.google.com/search?q=does+technical+analysis+really+work you get a ton of articles saying... yes it does. This is contrary to what I would have thought.

I've done a bit of light skimming on research papers related to computer programming algorithmic reinforcement training, and... it's almost 50-50. 50% of them say ""no correlation was found, what we developed underperformed, stock market price movement is basically random noise"" and the other 50% said ""yep, totally possible, we beat buy and hold"".

What's the truth? I'm not looking to hear ""1 in 10 people can successfully do TA/be a day trader/beat buy and hold"". I want to hear... why isn't it agreed upon that *0* out of 10 average people can beat buy and hold? and if quant funds can beat buy and hold... where are they? are they really ""so secret"" that only people with millions can access them?

vmgdo8,waltwhitman83,"How is S&amp;P 500 EPS TTM calculated for the index?

Not at the individual ticker level, I'm talking about:

https://ycharts.com/indicators/sp_500_eps_ttm $197.87, which they got from https://www.spglobal.com/spdji/en/documents/additional-material/sp-500-eps-est.xlsx which lists the past 4 quarters (TTM = trailing 12 months) as the following EPS for the entire index:

* 12/31/21 - $53.94
* 9/30/21 - $49.59
* 6/30/21 - $48.39
* 3/31/21 - $45.95

What weighting/formula are they doing? They don't seem to be doing EpsTtm*SharesOutstanding.

I have all the tickers of the S&amp;P in a spreadsheet with their shares outstanding (or shares float, it's only a touch off) + EPS TTM. You can use this to calculate P/E for a stock, and P/E for S&amp;P by sector, etc. 

I have all duplicate tickers removed (NWSA, FOXA, GOOGL)

I have ~322.447b for shares outstanding and $1.776t for earnings. That data makes no sense because it doesn't divide cleanly into $197.87

https://ycharts.com/indicators/sp_500_divisor

There's also some kind of divisor (8451.33 currently) but I don't think it's relevant. That's more for the free-float market-cap weight thingie (which I don't think applies to EPS?)

Some more fun facts: 18 companies in the S&amp;P have negative trailing-twelve month earnings:

* STZ - beer/wine/spirits distribution
* BIO - chemical production for biochemical / pharmaceutical
* CDAY - human capital management software
* AES - power generation and utility services through renewable and thermal generation facilities?
* LYV - live concerts
* WYNN - casino resorts
* CAH - healthcare services
* LVS - casinos
* CZR - casinos
* PEG - electric and gas services
* UAL - airline
* GE - high-tech industrial company
* AAL - airline
* EBAY - online marketplace
* NCLH - cruiseline
* BA - aerospace
* RCL - cruiseline
* CCL - cruiseline

I couldn't find any data on:

* CEG
* FDS
* FDX
* TJX

Once I have EPS data that calculates through, I'm going to analyze what % of EPS is driven by the top 10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 100 stocks by market cap. My guess is... quite a lot.",,,,,

Obviously, most of us are not professional analysts, so we are pretty far from ""the best person for the job"" when it comes to giving an educated opinion on such a robust economic topic.

2021 earnings: 208.49

2022 earnings estimate: 225

2023 earnings estimate: 240

Why are S&amp;P earnings estimated to grow 8% from 2021 -&gt; 2022, and 6.66% 2022 -&gt; 2023? If markets are forward looking... why does it feel like there's still a bit of wiggle room for future earnings estimates to be adjusted downwards? Why are markets being optimistic instead of pessimistic?

I pulled up the top 100 companies of the S&amp;P by earnings TTM (not EPS, EPS * # shares outstanding). Top 100 companies make up 65% of the market cap and 73% of the earnings for the S&amp;P500

Go through the list yourself and just ask yourself ""what's the growth case for this company if the country is in a very mild recession and consumers have less free cash to spend on goods/services due to increased living expenses like gas + energy + housing + food due to inflation and the federal reserve is making debt for financing growth slightly more expensive have previously""

Then ask yourself... why is 8% growth for this financial year priced in then? If you disagree that those 100 companies (or the bottom 400) could grow 8%... doesn't that mean we have more room to fall from S&amp;P500 3800 -&gt; some other number?",,,,,
wgkoe6,waltwhitman83,"How are /ES futures not ""too good to be true"" / a scam if they only take $6k-$12k in margin to get 50x SPX exposure (which would take $250k worth of SPY to achieve)

&gt; For example, if an E-mini S&amp;P 500 Index futures contract (/ES) has an initial margin requirement of $6,600 and a maintenance margin of $6,000, buyers or sellers must have $6,600 in their account to enter the contract and need to keep at least $6,000 in their account to stay in the position.

https://www.tdameritrade.com/retail-en_us/resources/pdf/TDA101284.pdf

&gt; So for the cost of $2 in commissions, you can risk $4-$6k of your account to get control of $100k worth of S&amp;P.  So if the S&amp;P goes up 1% and becomes $101k â€” you just made $1k on your ~$5k margin investment â€” thatâ€™s a 20% return on capital!

I feel like this can be super dangerous for the average retail investor who wants big returns but has little cash (sub $20k). Is that why this product exists? Is it almost predatory to get people to risk $10k of their net worth and get themselves into way too deep/hot risky water?

I'm not here to debate how risky margin/leverage (let alone 1 SPX point being $50 per contract).

I just feel like... it's too good to be true? Not only that... you can't do wash sale trade tax writeoffs with equities but you can with futures, and they are taxed more advantageously than equities

&gt; In the United States, futures contracts are subject to the 60/40 rule. This advantageous tax treatment also applies to day trades and is broken down into two parts: 60% profits â€“ taxed as long-term capital gains. 40% profits â€“ taxed as short-term capital gains.

&gt; For options and futures contracts, the wash sale rule applies to losses from the trades or sales of options and contracts to sell or acquire stocks or securities. It does not apply to losses that you incur from trades or sales of commodity futures contracts or of foreign currencies.",,,,,
x0rtww,waltwhitman83,"What's your take on the current economic landscape from an innovation/growth perspective?

I have this one friend who has been calling for all sorts of predictions for quite some time.

1. q3 earnings will be poor because _____ (consumer spending less because they feel poor)

2. q4 earnings will be worse because ____

3. markets donâ€™t bottom until folks give up (implying enough people will ""give up""/stop buying stocks soon and that will cause a crash)

4. layoffs should be ramping up soon because _____

5. corporations will not start any new projects + will run barebones to keep running safe but no growth because _____

6. Why are corporations brining workers back? because working from home is reduced productivity (despite evidence showing this is false)

7. all corporations are just doing updates, no innovation (because apple isn't releasing a product as disruptive as a new iPhone)

8. energy companies aren't expanding (no source/proof provided)

I have no clue why he has adopted this ""perma-bear"" mindset. I have no clue why he feels experienced enough to give his opinion on economic trends, but here we are.

I'd like to prove him right, or wrong. Does he do any research? Not really. He reads a lot of Yahoo! Finance articles/headlines.

Obviously small cap companies are probably not in a great spot given where interest rates are (and are headed) because they usually benefit the most from cheap financing.

What about the top 50 companies in the S&amp;P? What are the chances they *don't* grow profits in the next 5 years? Probably not likely.

So let's move the goalpost.

What kind of growth can we expect from the top 50 S&amp;P companies, given that:

1. it's more expensive to finance through debt

2. employees want/demand higher wages

3. everything costs more due to inflation

Are we in for a 5+ year period of ""meh"" growth?

Typically the market goes up 8-10% because corporate profits grow 8-10% year over year",,,,,

    2021 Q4 = 54.05

TTM is basically a rolling average, so 2021 Q3 (the oldest) will drop off and be replaced by 2022 Q3 (the newest).

    Past 4 quarters of S&amp;P500 EPS = 220.55
    Next quarter earnings (2022 Q3) predicted = 51.00

&gt; S&amp;P Global Inc. is an American publicly traded corporation headquartered in Manhattan, New York City. Its primary areas of business are financial information and analytics.

Can the market keep its current 20x valuation as earnings fall and bonds/treasuries become more attractive?

As earnings are released, you are looking at the market staying below 4000 until about Q1 2023 if current P/E ratio of 20x holds.

If investors flee equities because they want to lock in bonds/treasuries as they become more attractive (due to rising interest rates) or because they find equities with shrinking earnings less attractive, P/E ratios could fall below 20x (which is historically relatively high/inflated) causing for even more pain on the price side of the ratio.

With that said, if Q3 2022 EPS estimates are literally perfect and P/E ratio stays 20x, we'll end up at $3824.60

By Q3 2023, if EPS estimates are again perfect and P/E ratio stays unchanged, we'll end up at $4155.60

That'd be 8.65% return in 12 months, which is about inline with what equities do historically.

tl;dr 3763-3824 could be on the horizon, followed by the typical 8-10% return equities usually see as earnings grow and get returned to shareholders through price appreciation",,,,,
x503ax,waltwhitman83,"What do you think is a fair P/E ratio valuation for the SPX given rising interest rates?

If you can get a risk-free return of 3.5%-4% from treasuries/bonds, I don't think equities really demand a 20x P/E (which is what it is now)

What does that infer? P/E ratio stands to fall as equities become less attractive. This is made doubly worse by companies having high financing costs for growth, which will decrease earnings as well.

P/E falling from 20x (current levels) -&gt; 17.5x would mean S&amp;P price could fall another 12.5% from current levels.

Are stocks 12.5% less attractive/lucrative/valuable because bonds/yields are more attractive now?",,,,,
xdejj1,waltwhitman83,"We are 100% on track to 4%+ on federal funds rate in the near future (potentially 6%) Why are/aren't we in store for a ""Powell Shock"" (Volcker Shock 2.0)?

Inflation came in hot today. Fed has to do what they can to destroy demand to cool down the economy. Labor markets are still tight. Lower half of the economy is facing raising rent/food/energy prices that they can't easily absorb due to their low savings/low incomes.

Why is ""this time is different"" in 2022 for the Fed? Let's discuss. Why won't Powell be forced to raise interest rates to *at least* core PCE or above?

My personal take/guess:

If core PCE/CPI stay in the 6-8% range, once the fed gets rates up to 4% (which should be completed by November/December of this year), if inflation is still ""hot"", they'll probably be forced to hike rates even further at least match inflation. 400bps becomes 450bps which becomes 500bps, etc. That would take until about pretty much any time Q1-Q4 2023 (the FedWatch tool does not show anything 450bps realistically priced in whatsoever for the foreseeable futures) at the current pace.

I'm not sure what the ratio of ""federal funds rate -&gt; core PCE"" was during 1980 when Volcker put rates up to 18%. A quick Google says it was about 9%. That means it was 2x CPI/PCE (I know they aren't interchangeable, trying to keep this brief) -&gt; FFR.

Are we in store for 12% interest rates? Most likely not, right? Why is this time different?",,,,,
xeftus,waltwhitman83,"Let's settle this once and for all: Federal reserve interest rates + the US national debt

Part 2 of https://old.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/xdejj1/we_are_100_on_track_to_4_on_federal_funds_rate_in/

I see a lot of posts that say ""the Fed can't hike rates above 5% because then the US won't be able to afford to pay the interest on the $30t it holds in national debt"" as if the millisecond the interest rate changes, it backdates to all of the debt we've collected over the past years. I don't think that's how it works. I believe the overall national debt was financed at various rates over many years, and the current 2022-2023 ""high"" 4-6% interest rates would apply to any new debt issued during that timeframe (which we are running at a rate of about $1t a year as of https://fiscaldata.treasury.gov/national-deficit/ unless I'm reading it wrong) 

I'd like somebody with knowledge on the topic to share the truth and inform the many members of this subreddit who are confused, misinformed, wrong, etc. I know it's a complicated situation. Debt refinances itself, rolls over, etc. There is not a black/white right/wrong answer per se, but it does feel like lots of people are overly confident on their own misunderstanding of the concept.

I'd like to hear what people think is the upper limit the federal reserve can raise interest rates to (in an effort to combat inflation) before other things start to break (like people trying to get mortgages, the country being unable to repay the interest payment on its national debt, etc.)",,,,,
xjq6ay,waltwhitman83,"What if it really is as simple as ""don't fight the Fed""? Why DCA into equities during known unfavorable conditions?

It's undeniable that the bull run of basically 2009 -&gt; 2021 was fueled at least partially (if not majorly) by various forms of quantitative easing. Interest rates were historically extremely low. If you couple them with inflation at the time (2-3%), it was basically free to borrow money (with interest rates being 0-0.25%).

The market has very few reasons to be bullish in the current short term (6-18 months). The market is forward looking. We're starring down the barrel of at least 12 months of ""no more quantitative easing"" (aka higher interest rates). Couple that with quanatitive tighting, consumers feeling the effects of inflation and being unable to scrounge together discretionary funds for travel, renovations, general consumerism, etc.

Russia/Ukraine is, from what it seems, not getting any better.

American wages are having to grow due to a tight labor market. ""Quiet quitting"" is becoming a major thing. How are companies supposed to innovate/grow in these conditions?

There really isn't one country/region that is doing well. Europe has its issues. China has its issues. America has it issues.

Advice around here says: have about 3-6 months worth of cash and put the rest into equities. You're talking about most people having 95% of their non-real-estate net worth in equities based on how close they are relative to their retirement.

S&amp;P could stand to fall a lot more from 3800, couldn't it? We're still in a 19-20x P/E ratio area which is above 15x-17x which is the historical average. Historically, we're still technically ""expensive"". Historically, interest rates are still low, meaning they have more room to rise. If earnings suck during the next 2 quarters (which, they might/probably will for a slew of reasons), price could totally fall and we'd *still* be expensive P/E wise.

CPI/PCE have yet to top/slow down based on recent reports. We don't know how the ""European energy crisis"" will play out for the winter.

How likely is it that we will be back to 4500 within 18 months (18% from current levels)? Can the 2m+ investors here who have the majority of their net worth in equities really stomach another 15-30%+ downturn in the next 12-18 months?

We won't get to 400bps until November of this year (I didn't know that, I thought we were closer to 4% interest rates)

It seems the market really isn't pricing in anything above 450-475bps to be honest

There's a very slight hint that rates will peak by 06/2023 but that's obviously wild speculation/nobody has a clue/up for debate.

xlm732,waltwhitman83,"Does 50-day/200-day simple moving average (golden cross/death cross) outperform naive dollar-cost-average / buy-and-hold? 1993 -&gt; 2022

https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/deathcross.asp

&gt; The ""death cross"" is a market chart pattern reflecting recent price weakness. It refers to the drop of a short-term moving averageâ€”meaning the average of recent closing prices for a stock, stock index, commodity or cryptocurrency over a set period of timeâ€”below a longer-term moving average. The most closely watched stock-market moving averages are the 50-day and the 200-day.

https://www.investopedia.com/terms/g/goldencross.asp

&gt; A golden cross is a chart pattern in which a relatively short-term moving average crosses above a long-term moving average. The golden cross is a bullish breakout pattern formed from a crossover involving a security's short-term moving average (such as the 15-day moving average) breaking above its long-term moving average (such as the 50-day moving average) or resistance level. As long-term indicators carry more weight, the golden cross indicates a bull market on the horizon and is reinforced by high trading volumes.

We are currently in a ""death cross"" state.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moving_average_crossover

&gt; Golden cross occurs when 50 days simple moving average crosses 200 days simple moving average from below.[1] Death cross is an opposite situation, when 50 days simple moving average crosses 200 days simple moving average from above.[2] Death cross is not a reliable indicator of future market declines.[3]

It's only fired 27 times in the past 28 years.

Should you invest when the market is in this ""death cross"" state (50 day moving average less than 200 day moving average)? Looks like a great way to avoid a ton of drawdown. I just don't know if it also gives up potential return.

Are we all just waiting for the 50 day moving average (currently at $403.24 on SPY) to cross back over to the 200 day moving average (currently at $423.36 on SPY) before going long again? Should we be short right now, or cash?

3. there hasnâ€™t been â€œblood in the streetsâ€ level of pain (the sentiment here is still â€œjust DCA, it will be fineâ€ which possibly alludes to discounting the possibility that putting money index funds may take years to break even/maybe currently contributing to a falling knife)

11bnxd8,Wan_Haole_Faka,"How is the timeframe of purchased I-Bonds structured?

I'm not sure that's exactly the wording I'm looking for in how to ask this question. 

Basically, I'm wanting to buy into I-bonds slowly so that I can transfer half of my emergency fund into them. The reason for doing it slowly is obviously so that I can keep things relatively liquid, but have access to that money after a year.

So I'm essentially wondering if I buy a progressively higher dollar amount of I bonds every 1-3 months, is there a time stamp on the date I buy marking the 1 year designation when that arrives? For instance, I don't want a 6 month old bond purchase to be reset if I buy another sum. Does that make sense?

I'm not too worried about buying in specifically April or October because I believe the rates will be better than what I'm getting with Ally regardless.

Any clarification you can provide will be greatly appreciated. Have a great weekend!",,,,,
11pif2s,Wan_Haole_Faka,"Trying to understand brokerage strategy of old, liquidated windfall

So at 32, I'm trying to avoid punishing myself for misusing a windfall I received at 22. Currently, I'm only beginning to build up my financial literacy and at 22, I had my head so far in the clouds and just completely rejected the modern financial system. Ten years later, here we are with two feet, trying to walk on the ground.

I inherited a taxable brokerage account with about $72,000 of assets, all individual stocks. This money was coming from my deceased grandfather who I never met and was managed by my estranged uncle. My uncle made quite the fortune as a day trader, but I'm under the impression that this account was more a ""buy and hold"" type strategy. I remember at the time, some of my family members explained to me that the stocks were all dividend paying stocks that were being reinvested and that compounding the interest on the dividends was desirable.

There were no mutual fund holdings, just five individual stocks. It was all biotechnology, pharma, tobacco and AT&amp;T was the only company I recall. It seems like this is decently diversified for individual stocks. But after reading about index fund investing, this approach seems highly aggressive and overly risky. I gather that some people focus on growth stocks versus dividend stocks, but for most people, mutual funds and target date funds seem to be the best investment strategy. 

I guess I'm curious about how much growth even matters with dividend stocks. In a portfolio like I one I inherited, even if the market was down for a few years, I understand that my holdings would lose value, but some of that would be made up for in dividends, correct?

Also, why was this a taxable brokerage and not a 529?

I'm not a high income earner by any means, but am wanting to learn more about different investment strategies and perhaps even learn about day trading. Mainly, I just want to see different opinions on the usage of a taxable brokerage account for building wealth before retirement. I opened up a Roth IRA last year and maxed the contributions. Current holdings are 85% VTSAX and 15% VXUS.

I've only skimmed through ""The Little Book of Common Sense Investing"", but am wondering about using individual stocks (likely dividend stocks) buffered with maybe VOO in a taxable account that I sort of gamble with. Can day trading be done on the side or is it really more of a full-time thing? I'm not gambling with my IRA, obviously.

My company doesn't provide a 401K but I'm planning on changing companies soon anyways.

I have an emergency fund with Ally and am slowly buying into I bonds so that I'll eventually have 50% of my emergency fund in I bonds.

I'm not clear on my financial goals honestly. I might go back to school, may end up with a mortgage within 5 years, who knows? If I need a new car I won't finance it.

I know this ended up being a very broad post, but I'd be curious about any insight you may have on my situation and specifically why this windfall I inherited was structured in the way it was.

129slz0,Wan_Haole_Faka,"Wealthfront Cash Acct vs Ally no Penalty CD vs VMFXX

I'm looking to minimize inflation losses on an emergency fund and used truck fund. I currently use Ally as a HYSA which I'm so glad I learned about! I'm challenged with some of the verbiage that seems to keep changing, or maybe it's just that I'm still new to the world of finance.

The Wealthfront cash account is yielding 4.3% currently. Is this just another name for a HYSA or is it an MMA? Also, is their automated investing account just a standard taxable brokerage?

The Ally no-penalty CD rate just dropped to 4.35% as has recently been in discussion here. My main question with that is this: say you withdraw your funds before the end of the 11-month term, do you still earn the amount of interest at that rate in proportion to the time it was invested?

Then my question with the Vanguard Federal money market fund (which seems to have good return) is about it seemingly having a higher risk. Am I correct in understanding that the return isn't guaranteed with a money market account? If this is a viable option, I don't fully understand how to utilize it. I don't have any kind of brokerage account, just a Roth IRA that is with Vanguard. Would contributing money to the MMF count towards my 2023 IRA contributions? Because I don't want it to. My intention for that is obviously different and I would lump sum invest that in about a year from now.

As far as looking for better returns with an emergency/vehicle fund, I've started to slowly buy into I bonds so that I don't have too much money locked up at once. I sort of wish I could invest more, but my car has 246,000 miles on it and I don't want to take out a loan. My credit is at 694 and I'll likely be in the rental market soon, so I don't think I want to risk taking the hit to my credit with a mostly unpaid loan at the moment. I would buy a used truck in cash only, if I'm thinking about this correctly.

I would greatly appreciate any insights you are willing to share. Thanks in advance and enjoy the rest of your weekend!

Edit: Why is treasury direct always unavailable? I feel like each time I try to buy I bonds (every 4-6 weeks) the website is down. Is this just a high-traffic/lack of infrastructure thing?",,,,,
12b2i5c,Wan_Haole_Faka,"Understanding Yields/Returns of Short-Term Cash Vehicles

The two vehicles I'm deciding between are VMRXX and the Ally 11 month no-penalty CD.

The Ally CD is yielding 4.35% and I assume, if it were to be withdrawn early, you would earn the interest for the period of time it was invested in that vehicle.

What I find confusing about MMFs is the reason for the difference between the SEC yield and the 1/5/10 year average returns. For VMRXX, the SEC yield is 4.78%, but the one year average return is only 2.67%. So my question is what gives a better indicator of the profitability? I understand that MMFs pay dividends and not interest, but if the one year average return is only 2.67%, it seems like the no penalty CD from Ally is a better option. Yet I've noticed the kind folks here referring to the 4.78% SEC yield as the indicator of profitability. Which is it?

All insights and viewpoints are appreciated. Thanks!",,,,,
13u6pt5,Wan_Haole_Faka,"Is an HSA worth it given the high deductible?

Hello Everyone,

My main investment account is a Roth IRA and I'm toying with the idea of opening an HSA next year. I almost did it this year, but I just couldn't justify it with the possibility that I'd have to pay an $8,000 deductible if something happened. The triple tax advantages are enticing and if I opened one, I'd keep it invested in a total stock market index fund and pay for medical expenses out of pocket. It's just challenging when you compare an $800 deductible to an $8,000 deductible.

I'm 32 and work for a plumbing company and currently gross $45K, which will go up as I gain experience (I'm newer to the trade). My health is pretty good, but I think health mostly depends on self-respect & self-discipline. I injured my lower back (not at work) about a year ago and was out for almost 2 months. A little before this, I was hospitalized for upper abdominal pain that went away on its own. Screening came back negative for gallstones.

As far as why I got a Silver, low-deductible health plan this year, I wanted to be able to get affordable therapy if I wanted it. I saw a therapist for a couple months (I was in a cult for 9 years, but I'm digressing) and I'm having a hard time getting my sessions covered even though they take my insurance which is meant to be a $20 copay. My point is that for now, I'm more inclined to seek no-cost support groups if I feel I need it and think I am open to having that higher deductible.

So, based on your experience with it and my situation, is an HSA worth it? My company doesn't provide a 401K, but I'm likely changing companies soon and will contribute up to the match.

Thanks for any insights!",,,,,

14dtkmf,Wan_Haole_Faka,"Something in my budget is off and I'm having a hard time telling what.

Happy Monday!

I'm trying to build an accurate monthly budget based on my net pay, building in the cushion of me possibly not getting paid for 2 weeks of the year due to family leave, injury, etc.

My net income is $697/wk. I've tried doing this two different ways and am clearly missing something.

First, my budget was incorrect because I was using $697x4=**$2,788**, but I had obviously forgotten to exclude two weeks of pay annually.

To adjust for this, I came to ($697x50)/12= **$2,904**.

What I don't understand is why the second number is higher if it allegedly accounts for getting paid only for 50 weeks a year. I have a feeling that the difference is because there aren't exactly 4 weeks in a month, but I don't know how to verify for certain. Is the second figure the correct one and why?

I appreciate any and all insights. Have a wonderful evening!

Edit: Got it figured correctly now two different ways:

($697 x 50) / 12 = 2,904

($17.425 x 2,000) / 12 = $2,904

14htw71,Wan_Haole_Faka,"At what point are you putting too much money into an older car?

I have an '05 Toyota Solara (4 cylinder) with 248,000 miles that's been very well taken care of its entire life. I have a record of every oil change. Its tax value is about 3K. In the last two months, I've spent over $3,500 in repairs that according to my mechanic (engine is good), are worth it. They run a very busy shop and don't ""need"" the work. 

In the $3,500, I'm not counting things like brakes or new tires. Here's the breakdown:

$760- Power steering pump, pressure line, pressure sensor & fluid (had a fluid leak)

$1,320- Key cylinder, housing for cylinder, switch assembly (key wouldn't turn engine over)

$226- Valve cover gasket set, coil wiring (oil leak and corroded coil wire)

$1,260- Front struts, lower control arms, end links (front end felt wobbly and creaky, but not sure if was a necessity)

I'm hoping everything is going to be okay for a while, but is all this work even a good investment? I'm changing jobs and cities soon so definitely need a car. I have about $14K set aside in a MMF as like my used car fund for when that day comes. The whole situation is making me consider whether I need to change a line item in my budget, because I currently have like $70/month allocated to car maintenance, perhaps it should be a higher number. I always thought that leasing cars was silly because you never really own it, but when you divide the cost of a new or used car over its lifespan, leasing starts to look like a new option. 

I'm a second year apprentice plumber so net about 3K/month now but anticipate a higher income in the coming years. When I change jobs, I might actually take a pay cut just to get better training.

Any opinions on the topic are much appreciated. Have a great weekend!

14nywed,Wan_Haole_Faka,"New to this, better to wait for a recession before I start investing? Different strategies?

Hi everyone,

I'm a 32 y/o 2nd year apprentice plumber who nets 35K annually. I'm a late bloomer and within the last two years learned most of what I know about managing money from r/personalfinance.

For a little background, I was in a cult for 9 years and severely mismanaged a windfall from my deceased grandfather's investments. In the last 3 years, I paid off 7K of capital gains tax and 6K of credit card debt after working in landscaping and attending trade school. Last year I opened an IRA and maxed my contributions in 85% VTSAX and 15% VTIAX.

I've learned a little about index fund investing and see the value of being consistent, not trying to beat the market all the time and not being caught up in the drama of what the economy is doing. I gather that most of the ""Bogle"" type investors see owning individual stocks as gambling. The problem is, I have a little more risk tolerance (for 1-3% of my income) and feel like I need to take some risks for greater reward. There's so much to learn. I don't necessarily want to study quarterly earnings reports, but I want to have one portfolio dedicated to a more aggressive approach with bigger name, well-known companies. I have other interests in education besides finance, but I am willing to dedicate a good chunk of time to learning how to go about all this. 

My expenses are fairly low. I live with a family member and will likely be changing jobs and moving soon. I expect to have a roommate. I drive an old Toyota, have an e fund (that I still need to grow) and a used car fund of about 14K. I have a car payment line item in my budget. Net worth (including retirement) is about 32K.

That said, I have some specific questions;

1) Is it a common approach to have a ""safe"" retirement account (i.e., 401K/IRA in index funds/target date fund) and a taxable brokerage for a more ambitious strategy? I have Vanguard for my IRA, but just realized they don't let you purchase fractional shares, so I'm looking into Fidelity. Thoughts?

2) The personal finance flowchart is all about saving for specific goals and putting most of your investments into retirement/HSA/529. It's all about delayed gratification, which I get. I just don't have a lot of specific goals, but I feel like I could make better use of a standard taxable brokerage for a small percentage of more aggressive investing, even if I don't mess with it for 5-10 years +. Is this a reasonable sentiment? I feel like if I ever want to realistically own a home/property and/or be financially independent, I need to take some more risks.

3) I have some half-baked ideas for diversifying an individual stock portfolio. I gather one would do well to include growth stocks, dividend stocks, defensive and blue chip. Altria seems like they will continue to provide consistent dividends. PXD seems to offer higher dividend potential, albeit inconsistent. Would it be so rash to throw in equal proportions of the two aforementioned with Apple, Amazon, Verizon, Cisco, Home Depot, Cat, 3m, Fedex, Netflix, Target, WM? In my mind, it makes sense to include different types of stocks from different sectors to hedge against downturn in any given sector.

4) I keep an E fund and other savings I need liquid in a MMF with a current SEC yield of 5.08% and 50% state tax exemption. I'm chomping at the bit to get a little cash in some of these companies, but does it make more sense to just hold extra cash in the MMF and wait until things get worse economically, or not so much? Are some stocks more immune to economic downturn such as Altria & Waste Management?

Lastly, based on my curiosities, what 1 or 2 books would you recommend to me about investing and building wealth? There's just so much out there! I really want to get a good bang for my buck because one can only read so much. I'm also studying plumbing code and Spanish, but I'm willing to put in the work to learn more about investing and finance.

I appreciate any tips or feedback you are willing to share with me. Thank you so much and have a wonderful weekend!",,,,,

Hi everyone,

I suppose this is more of a lifestyle and career question, but it has a lot to do with finance, so here we are. Clearly there's no one size-fits-all approach, but I'm a 32 y/o guy with no mouths to feed and am wondering about increasing and diversifying my income streams. I'll confess that I have a bit of a roundabout way of presenting information.

I'm a bit of a late bloomer and am nearly 1.5 years into a plumbing apprenticeship and really started adopting better financial habits about 2 years ago. I'm not interested in ""finding my passion"" or anything, but like all of us, I know we do better whilst leaning into our strengths. Getting into plumbing was about practicality for me and I guess it takes longer to really learn a trade than I thought. Sure, there will be better money down the road, but given the environmental toxins, I just don't know if it's what I want to do long-term. Last week I was replacing all of the water lines in an old house that had a leaking roof, no gutters and major humidity/mold issues everywhere. I enjoy learning and getting to be active, but I've been thinking a lot about diversifying my income streams, as I mentioned. I don't have to deal with the health ramifications of a sedentary lifestyle, but there are absolutely environmental concerns. 

I'm trying to decide how to block out my time/energy for education. I will list a few current as well as potential educational contenders.

1) Plumbing code/ technical aspects of trade: This can help to increase my earning potential and works towards my licensure. Granted, I can learn a lot of this just at work.

2) Potentially starting online, part-time degree, let's say in finance: I've felt empowered in learning about all aspects of finance and am looking at how and where I could potentially break into the industry, perhaps with FP&A or corporate finance. I was looking at IB but it seems very competitive, realistically. 

3) Spanish language: This one is sort of a toss-up between enjoyment and practicality. Yes, it may be one of the few things I enjoy, but is it really profitable to continue studying this amazing language? I'm at about a B1 level and am trying to see how I could leverage this skill for career advancement.

So here are some thoughts:

1) At my current net income of $34,848, maxing my IRA is investing just shy of 18% of my income. I didn't have any investments until last year. Currently, I could perhaps invest 25% of my income, utilizing either a taxable brokerage or a 401K from a different company I'll likely move to (current company offers no benefits except work vehicle).

2) I won't go into debt to go back to school. I haven't looked at the costs of part-time, online B.S. programs but for I feel like they could be fairly economical. I have some credits from 14 years ago but am not sure if they are still valid or not. To pay for all this, I'd likely have to back off from my arguably already deficient retirement investments. I'd be borrowing from my future self to \*perhaps\* increase my income or at least give me another career option. Is it worth it?

3) Am I spreading myself too thin to have any meaningful impact?

I'm fighting feelings of having wasted my 20's and am at a point where I'm willing to make sacrifices in the realms of leisure & romance to get to a point where I feel as though I have sovereignty over my life's trajectory. 

I'd appreciate any and all feedback or insights.

Thanks and Happy Sunday!",,,,,

I think Vanguard does automated investing once your portfolio hits 50K, but I'm not quite there yet. If I transferred this account, I would try to do a cash transfer, not an ""in kind"" transfer because I hold Vanguard funds. Is there a way they are able to keep track of which contributions correspond to which year?

15usxnl,Wan_Haole_Faka,"Which is more tax advantaged at the state level, VMRXX or VMFXX?

I'm in NC if it matters and loving the yields from MMFs right now for holding cash.

My understanding is that dividends earned from both funds are 100% tax exempt at the federal level and that VMRXX is exempt from 50% of state taxes, provided your state has income taxes. I'm having a hard time getting solid information though about VMFXX and state taxes. The dividend yield from the two are comparable, so I'd love to know if there are any advantages to one over the other.

I like how Vanguard lets you write checks from the settlement fund. Ideally, I'd keep my car fund in VMFXX and an E fund in VMRXX, but if the tax advantages are significantly better in one over the other, I'd lump everything together and just keep it separated in my head.

16jgz76,Wan_Haole_Faka,"It will be educational to know the oldest person here still living with their parents, NO SHAME!

I'm not talking about people whose parents live with them, because that's obviously a different situation completely. I'm talking about folks that for one reason or another, have chosen to live with a parent/parents for financial reasons.

As a 32 year old man, I've gotten down on myself emotionally for living with my mother for the last 18 months. I offered her rent payments, but she adamantly refused to ever charge me. Long story short, I was in a cult for 9 years, got out, went to trade school and am now an apprentice plumber. I don't earn a lot, but in that time I've been able to pay off my entire 7K of CC debt, build an emergency fund of 3 months, open an IRA and max my contributions for two years, save up enough to buy my next car in cash and lastly start a tiny house downpayment fund in a brokerage acct. 

I've found that at my current pay and budget, I could afford $870/month in rent + utilities. However, the longer I can avoid having a housing payment, the longer that additional mensual $870 can be put towards Equities for owning a home as well as increasing my emergency fund & car fund. I'd love to just get a good chuck of money in equities before I back off and have to pay rent until I'm a homeowner just to start the snowball of interest, dividends & capital gains.

I don't know honestly if this is even a healthy situation or not, which made me curious to see if anyone else has done something similar. 

Happy Friday!

16qkcmp,Wan_Haole_Faka,"Does it ever make sense to have multiple brokerage accounts?

I'd like to start by offering a bit of gratitude to this community. Two years ago (at 30), I found this sub and started gaining financial literacy. I began to realize how sheltered I had been from the importance of managing money. This realization was a catalyst for me leaving a high control ""spiritual"" group I was heavily involved with for 9 years, where I had given up my personal sovereignty. Terrible. So, I went to trade school, work in plumbing and have been investing for 18 months. Basically, without embellishing, this sub changed the trajectory of my life.

It became clear that this sub strongly endorses the index style of investing, so I found some of the Bogle literature and opened an IRA with Vanguard. My holdings are currently 90% VT, 10% AVUV and I intend to keep it mostly that way. I might diversify my SCV with another Avantis fund, but not more than 10% SCV total. I contribute $542/month, so this will be my second-year maxing contributions. 

In considering time horizons for different purposes, I realized that if I don't make a line item in my budget for a house downpayment and put it in treasuries or something, it will never happen. Even though it's controversial, I elected to invest these funds in equities for a 5-10+ year time horizon. If it's a bear market I'll just keep renting, whatever. I'm not comfortable borrowing from my IRA and I wouldn't do it from my 401K either if I had one. Basically, I opened a brokerage account with Vanguard and contribute like $80/month. Of course, I'll up that number soon, but that's where I am. My holdings are 65% VTI, 20% QQQM & 15% VXUS, but I'm having other ideas in line with value investing. 

To narrow down exactly what I'm asking, this account is for a specific purpose, a house. I have a separate chunk of money I keep in a MMF that is for buying my next car in cash, which will likely happen within the next 3 years. A set dollar amount each month goes into that account. My plan is that once I have to buy my next car, I'll immediately start INVESTING (not saving) the equivalent of a car payment each month. I'd be investing that money because I shouldn't need another car for 12-15 years. The crux of my question is: Does it make sense to keep this NEXT car fund money in a separate brokerage account from the home downpayment funds, or is it more practical if I lump it all together? I like the idea of having separate accounts for different purposes, but I wonder if I'd be missing out on some compounding gains by doing that. I don't know if the extra account would be worth the headache. 

Since I'm using more of the indexing approach with my IRA, I'll probably keep it with Vanguard. For the brokerage account, I've thought about moving it to Fidelity simply because they allow you to buy fractional shares. I don't like that Vanguard only lets you buy whole shares of non-Vanguard funds. I just ordered ""The Intelligent Investor"" and am planning on learning how to do a proper valuation. I want to build a portfolio of companies (and at least 50% VTWAX, I promise!) that are on sale. Some will likely be buy and hold for a long time, some may just be a couple or a few years if I decide to trim winners or write off losers. Something is always on sale. I want to be able to pick a few companies, conduct a thorough valuation and allocate an equal percentage of a given lump sum to each. I might not even keep my allocation of individual companies above 10%. If it does well, it'll fund my safer investments. If it goes poorly, then I'm sure I'll take away a powerful life lesson somehow.

Hi everyone,

Three years ago, I started forcing myself to gain some financial literacy, because I had literally NONE. It's been a great journey from squandering my grandfather's inheritance, building up my credit card debt (the higher the number the better, right?) and being delinquent in paying capital gains tax.

1734xdv,Wan_Haole_Faka,"Is it reasonable to update vehicles simply for a sense of security and freedom??

For various reasons, I just don't want to deal with the experience of an old car breaking down on me in any situation. Let's say I don't want to appear unreliable to an employer, I don't want to hassle with buying a new car not having one, might be changing jobs to a different town where I don't know a lot of (or any) the community.

I drive an '05 Toyota Solara with 248,000 miles on it. It's been very meticulously cared for. I just had my mechanic do the front struts, rack & pinion, power steering pump & alternator. The car drives amazingly (like butter), but maybe it's better if I sell it to a mechanic who can just call his wife when the thing breaks down and say ""Honey, can you please bring the wrecker?""

In case it's relevant, here are some numbers:

I have $15,500 in a MMF that is intended for purchasing a different vehicle when that time comes and am able to add about $500 to that fund each month.

I have another 7K emergency fund that I could float a small portion from towards a vehicle.

At 32, I'm a second-year apprentice plumber and currently have a work van, but might not get that right away if/when I change companies. I'm looking at either a Corolla or a Tacoma, depending on whether I have access to overtime or need to look for side jobs. If I could just rely on overtime from my employer, I'd save a ton of money driving a corolla. I'd even consider a Prius, but I don't know if they have the same reliability as the other two. I'm more interested in reliability and longevity than I am in saving money on gas, but any expense is relevant. 

For a little more lifestyle/background, I currently have a gig where I'm helping my boss remodel his house and 50% of the time I get paid as overtime through the company, rest of the time is cash. I work about 60 hours a week now, which helps a lot. Even on a regular 40 hour week budget, I'm able to save or invest 54% of my net income because I don't currently have a housing payment or dependents. I'm looking at changing companies & towns (live in a small town) because there isn't any training structure within my company and I feel like they're not investing into my education very much. It's taking me too long to learn this high-value skill and I'd even consider taking a pay cut to be in a more educational environment, maybe with some classroom time, etc.

I also set cash aside for larger purchases and won't finance anything except a home if that materializes. So, a temporary depletion of principal shouldn't be an issue for me.

I have a tendency to look for things that are on sale, but that might be more of an approach for my taxable brokerage account. On that subject, my recently opened taxable brokerage is specifically for the intention of saving for a home downpayment that is 5-10 years off. For this reason, I don't believe that the 5-factor approach is appropriate. My main holdings are VTI @ 80%, VXUS @ 10% and cash @ 10%. The cash is essentially just dry powder in the event that I find funds or even individual value stocks on sale. I'm starting to learn about value investing and am comfortable using 10% of my taxable brokerage for this. Depending on how this goes, I may expand that percentage in the future or just use any results to underwrite safer investments._x000D_

I am deeply hoping to buy a house in 5-10 years. I don't have a 401k yet, but plan to switch jobs soon and contribute a little beyond the match.

Six months ago I started saving for this purpose in a taxable brokerage because I felt that it was silly to draw from retirement and negatively affect your compounding, but now I'm having second thoughts. Purely from a tax efficiency perspective, taking a 401k loan makea more sense I think, assuming you are contributing as much as possible with all your investing goals in mind. What do you think?

Also, I gather that with repaying this type of loan you pay a small amount of interest. Is this interest paid purely to your own 401K or to the broker? 

Any insights are appreciated.

vkho1z,Wan_Haole_Faka,"Wise to invest with rather minimal income?

I feel the desire to invest fairly aggressively (30% of my income) even though I'm not earning a ton. My expenses however are pretty low.

I'm a 31 year old first year plumber's apprentice and take home roughly $32,000 annually, plus the perhaps monthly production bonus and occasional overtime. That number should be increasing soon though because I'm driven and spend my weekends learning code, studying the trade and am starting to do side jobs, which increases my bottom line and experience faster. I'm trying to increase my value as fast as possible.

I was in a clingy so-called ""spiritual"" group (Christian-flavored Andean Shamanic practices) for 9 years, got into some CC debt and ultimately found the lifestyle lacking in trust and unsustainable. Debt is somewhat old, I'm in the process of validating it now. Less than $7,000 overall. Will negotiate pay for deletion if they have their ducks in a row, but my credit isn't completely suffering. I am an authorized user on a couple accounts and have one secured card that is keeping my fico 8 score around 616 and will only improve, even if I do nothing about the debt (however I plan to act on it).

I don't pay rent as I currently live with my mother and am grateful for that, but obviously want my own place. However I can't afford to live where I work. Lifestyle inflation will not be a problem for me, regular inflation is already crazy. I have no problem buying good model cars with 150,000 miles on them when the old one craps out. I don't want to just save and wait until I get paid more. I'm wondering if aggressive investing will be my best move. Money sitting is just being lost anyways. We don't have direct deposit so I can't capitalize on Porte's 3% APY savings account. Even so, you're just losing less money. I found some 6 month 6 CDs at 1.28% that I may try to purchase every month, but even that's a very defensive move.

Honestly I need help. I feel like I'm trying to play catch-up with my life.

I have a lot to learn about investing but whatever I do will be diverse. I'm thinking a buy and hold method since I don't want to be monitoring stuff each day. Been looking at index funds, tech stocks, growth stocks, amazon, 3m, blue chip stocks, etc. Don't want to invest in tobacco, pharma or biotech. People say not to invest emotionally, but to me it's not emotional, rather moral, for lack of a better word. I know I'm not making a lot right now, but I could see myself investing 30% of what I make consistently with a good strategy along with increasing my value, I am optimistic. I'd love to hear any advice from this community. Thanks in advance!

I don't have an IRA yet but am curious about that too. I pay taxes now but wonder if there's a way to avoid paying too much in capital gains?",,,,,
vts4qs,Wan_Haole_Faka,"Are Roth IRA funds really as flexible as I believe?

I've recently heard that for a Roth IRA, you can take the funds out whenever you want, for whatever reason and at no penalty, just not your earnings. Is this true? If so, do people use their IRAs for more flexible things like emergency funds, shorter-term savings accounts, etc? 

I've always thought IRAs were pretty locked up, but have even read that for a conventional IRA you can take out up to $10,000 as a down payment for a first time home buyer and an unlimited amount for higher education. But it sounds like a Roth IRA is even more flexible. Is all this true?

w0ptf4,Wan_Haole_Faka,"ETFs versus Index funds for IRA and Brokerage account

Hi all,

I'm days away from paying off all my credit card debt and plan on opening a Vanguard IRA very soon and likely a regular brokerage account soon thereafter.

I'm attracted to index funds because as I understand it, those investments dissuade you from emotional trading. I don't know how this works but perhaps there are transaction fees that aren't associated with ETFs? The only reason I'm really even considering ETFs is to be able to diversify my portfolio in the beginning.

For example, if I were to max out a new Roth IRA for the first year, I'd probably buy half in VTSAX and half in VITAX. But I feel like that's too high of a percentage in the international market and wouldn't be able to address it until the following year. If I open a brokerage account, I'd probably start with the same two funds and although index funds are by nature, diverse, is it wise to hold the exact same things in all your investment accounts? If I were to modify my potential holdings, maybe I'd be conservative the first year with my IRA and do half VBTLX half VTSAX. I assume VBTLX also has a $3,000 buy in minimum? With index funds for more modest investors, is it always sort of clumsy in the beginning until you have enough invested that you can diversify?

Additionally, a random thought about I bonds: It looks like VFIAX has a 7.8% profitability and VTSAX has about 8.2%. Obviously there's other factors at play, but to my untrained eye, it looks like I bonds are even more profitable than these funds if you buy in at the right time to be able to get a sense of projected interest rates. Thoughts?

For some background I'm 31, take home $32,000 annually, have low expenses currently and if I'm not earning $100,000 a year from my job in 4 years, something is seriously wrong. It's unlikely that I'll go back to school, but not outside the realm of possibility.

I appreciate any insight you may have. Thank you!",,,,,

At 31 I had never been to the E.R. before a couple weeks ago. I'm learning a new trade and ended up starting with a company that doesn't offer health insurance. I thought my bill was going to be like $400 for just bloodwork and a CT scan but it actually ended up coming to $1,475. Even the financial counselor at the hospital told me that they usually are open to negotiation. My question is what is reasonable? How low should I be able to go?

z3nhgn,Wan_Haole_Faka,"Lifestyle choices, IRA contributions and family support

Hi Everyone,

This will be a sort of circuitous financial/life advice-seeking post.

I am a single 31 year old male and am currently living with a parent. Long story short I never made the mental connection of getting my feet on the ground in regards to a career and finances until recently.

I'm wanting to live alone but am wondering if it's too early. I just paid off all my debt and earn $40,000 gross annually as an apprentice plumber. I went to a brief trade school for service plumbing 9 months ago and have been employed in the trade ever since. I may have to change companies to be valued and learn with more experienced professionals. As long as I'm working in plumbing my goal is to be licenced if only for purposes of wage negotiating power. Another reason I may need to change companies is because they don't offer health or dental. They seem to want to pay their employees just enough to be able to live with a working spouse and qualify for Medicaid and in some cases, subsidized housing.

I'm also considering going back to school to study Spanish and/or something related to conflict resolution. If I do this I'd likely attend night/weekend/online courses while working full-time. Chances are I would accept tuition help offered from family 

I was also recently offered my first ever paid writing gigs through Freelancer, a path I haven't gone down yet, but there's potential for that type of side job. I usually work weekend side jobs doing various labor/handyman type things.

I have $17k in savings and about $2,500 in an IRA that I just opened this year. My car is a make and model known for longevity but has 245,000 miles on it. My savings is kind of like an emergency fund but also a down payment for a used truck.

My IRA is just a standard 3 fund portfolio. I'd like to max it each year, especially given that I have no 401k, but I'm now also questioning if I should even max it each year.

I don't have any other investments due to being a low income earner and also because I need to keep my assets relatively liquid. I've procrastinated in opening a HYSA, but it's on the list. I'm also planning on slowly buying into I-Bonds with the goal of building up 50% or so of my emergency fund to be inflation protected.

I wouldn't say I'm miserable cohabitating with dear parental companionship, in fact I'm grateful for the opportunity to be able to save a little money despite the harsh reality check of being in my situation. I sort of feel like an entitled fellow saying this, knowing that in many cultures, 4 generations of family live together in undersized accomodations and build a decent amount of wealth, I just want my own space. Perhaps I'm like every other Westerner.

I realize that this is very personal to each individual, but I'm trying to be realistic about what to prioritize. It's hard to find a studio-type apartment in my area for under $1,100. I earn $2,600/mo. after taxes which clearly makes this difficult. I'm also currently uninsured. As I mentioned, I usually have side income and also get performance bonuses most paychecks, but I don't find it realistic to build a budget around that type of income.

I'm in a space where I'm trying to decide if I'll pursue something that is allegedly lucrative after bearing a process of a few years and find fulfilment in other things or if I should pursue something more fulfilling to me. I know this is borderline r/careeradvice, but here we are.

Is it too early for me to move out if I want to keep maxing my IRA? Is it worth it to potentially trade my IRA contributions for a little more peace in my life?

I appreciate any and all advice. Please be completely honest.

pqyny1,wannafightabout_it,"Can someone review my retirement strategy and tell me if this would work the way I think it would?

Hi all,

I'm interested in early retirement.

\- I'm 37.  
\- I have $225,000 in my 401k.  
\- My salary is \~$108,000.  
\- I max out my 401k at $19,500, my HSA at $3,600, and my Roth IRA at $6,000 = \~$30k / year (or $2,500 / month).  
\- My expenses are about $30k / year.

I would like to know if my plan makes any sense. According to this Coast Fire calculator ([https://walletburst.com/tools/coast-fire-calc/](https://walletburst.com/tools/coast-fire-calc/)), if I put in the information above + a retirement age of 52, then it indicates that I would reach my Coast Fire goal in 8 years, at age 45.

Aside from my 401k/HSA/Roth saving over the next 8 years, if I also saved $27,000 / year in cash (or something safe), then I should also have $216,000 in my account after those 8 years. 

So at that point, rather than just work to cover bills from age 45 to 52 like one would typically do in Coast Fire, couldn't I use $30k / year from the $216,000 bucket? That would cover the 7 years between ages 45 and 52. Then at 52, I would be at my FIRE goal.

Also, starting at age 47 (five years before 52), I would leverage a Roth Conversion Ladder from my 401k/Traditional IRA each year to bridge the gap from ages 52 to 60.

So effectively, I'm wondering if I could retire in 8 years at age 45 if I continue to contribute \~$30k/year to my retirement accounts and \~30k/year to a bank account for those 8 years?

Am I missing something big or does what I'm suggesting make some sense?

pxjoet,wannafightabout_it,"How can I plan for what my W-4 should look like next year?

I know the IRS has a calculator to help with all of this, but Iâ€™m a little stuck for a few reasons.

My and my wifeâ€™s W-4s are not at all coordinated. We file jointly and have two children but thereâ€™s no indication of that on either of our W-4s. Problem #1.

I switched jobs a few months back and so not only is my W-4 not aligned with my situation, but I have two jobsâ€™ worth of wages to work through. Granted, the IRS calculator helps with this, so itâ€™s not my biggest issue, but still an added layer of complexity.

In addition, next year weâ€™re both planning to make some fairly significant adjustments to our HSA, DC-FSA, and 401k contributionsâ€¦ + I might be getting a bonus.

So Iâ€™m wanting to just leave things as they are for 2021, get a way-bigger-than-I-should refund, but get the W-4 squared away for January 2022.

But how do I do that? The IRS calculator is for 2021 (not 2022), it asks for pay stub and YTD information which I donâ€™t have for 2022, it asks about federal tax withholdings, which I donâ€™t know, etc. I tried to pretend my situation for next year is what it is for this year (when using the calculator) but 2021 was weird and numbers were different just this year (e.g., the Child Tax Credit amongst other things), so Iâ€™m not sure how accurate it is.

Can anyone offer some advice for how to figure out what my W-4 should look like based on what I know the salary and contribution situation will be next year?

pzzztx,wannafightabout_it,"Did I make a mistake with 2021 dependent care FSA vs Tax Credit.

Hi, anyone who is familiar with this subject for the 2021 year knows that there are a lot of factors (like AGI, daycare costs, etc.) that go into whether itâ€™s worth contributing to a DC FSA or just taking the DC credit at the end of the yearâ€¦

I just wanted to try to simplify my situation to see if I chose the â€œwrongâ€ path. My daycare expenses for 2 kids are $10,400 / yearâ€¦

I did what I did in 2020 which was sign up to contribute $5,000 to my DC FSA.

I know the DC FSA (and tax credit limit) was raised to $10,500 but my employer didnâ€™t allow for the mid-year change. Regardless, I changed jobs mid year and my new employerâ€™s limit is also $5,000â€“so I signed up for that full amount (crunched into my remaining paychecks). So that means my total contribution for the year will be the $2,500 I claimed from my previous employer + the $5,000 from my current employer = $7,500.

So yes this reduces my taxable income by $7,500 and I can also subtract that from my daycare costs (I think). $10,400 - $7,500 = $2900, and assuming Iâ€™m right at the $125k AGI, I think it would be $2900 * .50 = $1,450 credit.

Does that sound right?

If so, I think itâ€™s a question of whether the $7,500 marginal tax savings + $1,450 credit is higher than if I had just not done a DC FSA at all and just claimed a $5,200 credit ($10,400 * .50)

Also, Iâ€™m in New York State. Can anyone tell at a quick glance whether the Credit path wouldâ€™ve been better?

Bonus: our AGI for the entirety of next year (2022) will be quite a bit higher than this year, so if the dependent care limits return to what they were for 2022, is there a clear winner for which path to chooseâ€¦?

q5aqng,wannafightabout_it,"Can/Should I use a Traditional IRA as a funnel to my Traditional 401k?

In my three jobs so far, I've always contributed to a Traditional 401k. When I left my first job, I rolled the 401k balance into a Traditional IRA that has just been sitting there for a while. I had opened up a Roth IRA shortly after and just contributed to that over the years without much thought other than I've already paid the tax on the money so it'll grow tax free and I can access it in retirement tax free.

So fast forward to now where I've started to look more closely at my finances. I'm at an income level of $100k+ and collectively, my wife and I are comfortably in the 22% tax bracket but I could see us eventually crossing the direct Roth IRA contribution threshold, so I've decided to roll my Traditional IRA (my former 401k money) into my 401k (which allows roll ins) and close my Traditional IRA account so that I don't have any basis in a Traditional IRA in case we want to do a backdoor Roth conversion.

So that leaves me with a Traditional 401k and a Roth IRA. My plan was that, going forward, I would max each of these out and be set up for a Backdoor Roth Conversion if necessary....great. But then I thought to myself, aside from the inherent diversification of having both Traditional and Roth retirement accounts, why am I mixing and matching the tax advantaged accounts? It would seem, if I opened a new Traditional IRA and maxed out that instead of the Roth IRA, I would be able to

1. Take the $6,000 deduction (even if I take the standard deduction), which I can't take now if I'm contributing to a Roth IRA.
2. Immediately roll in the $6,000 I contribute to the Traditional IRA at the beginning of each year into my 401k so that my Traditional IRA balance stays at $0 in case I ever want to leverage a Backdoor Roth conversion (only paying tax on the amount converted and nothing else, which is what would've been the case if I had made direct Roth contributions of the same amount anyway).

I think my new plan would be to max out my Traditional 401k (and HSA) as planned, stop contributing to my Roth IRA and instead max out a Traditional IRA and roll it into my 401k each year, take the additional $6k tax deduction ($20,500 401k + $6k tIRA + $3,650 1/2 Family HSA = $36,150), and my remaining money after the $36,150 pretax deductions + expenses (bills, etc.) would go right into a Brokerage account. And it's this Brokerage account that would act as the one to help diversify the portfolio (instead of the Roth IRA) as it's post-tax money + very liquid/accessible, etc.

And if I decide to focus only on contributing to my Traditional IRA and funnel the contributions into my 401k, then the Roth IRA thresholds never come into play and then a backdoor Roth is kind of a moot point...

Is my understanding correct in that I can use my Traditional IRA to funnel money to my 401k and leave the possibility open for me to do a backdoor Roth conversion? 

And do you agree that this would be a good move to change my strategy from maxing out my Roth IRA to maxing out a Traditional IRA (and moving the money into the 401k), then leveraging a Brokerage account?

I hope that all made sense. I'm not an expert here, so that's why I'm looking for your opinions/guidance.

Thank you!

Essentially, if you've followed the [flowchart](https://i.imgur.com/lSoUQr2.png) from the wiki (i.e., you have well-funded retirement accounts, your kids have well-funded 529s) and your kids are about to head to college at the time you could conceivably retire, what's the optimal way to fund (or save on) college?

1) Retire and show much less income and claim the children as dependents.  
2) Keep working and claim the children as dependents.  
3) Don't claim the children as dependents and try to max financial aid offering.  
4) If income or 529 balance is high enough, just pay

I know there's other possibilities too--I'm just not sure what results in the best outcome. I'm also not sure how 529s and/or the parents' retirement accounts play into all of this. I want to start thinking about a strategy from now (aside from just funding 529s) so that I don't over fund or make a poor decision.

So maybe the question is, what type of family/financial situation results in the cheapest or most easily-funded college?...then work backwards to create that situation...

Hi, this may be a dumb question but hereâ€™s the situation.

My wife, my kids, and I have been on my wifeâ€™s HDHP for a few years now. My wife also has an HSA that has some money in it. I have a card and am an authorized userâ€¦

Fast forward to today where I have a new job that pays entirely for a single HDHP and partially funds an HSAâ€”so I signed up for both and now I have an HSA with some money in it and my primary insurance is my new HDHP and Iâ€™m secondarily covered on my wifeâ€™s family plan.

Both of us have a debit card for my HSA too. Not that any of it matters because weâ€™re just collecting receipts right now and donâ€™t plan on cashing those in until we need to (e.g., funding early retirement).

Anyway, Iâ€™m trying to figure out not WHAT qualifies but WHO qualifies. When the time comes, can I use my childrenâ€™s medication receipts to withdraw money from my HSA? I paid for it with my credit card at the pharmacy. What about my medical expenses? It would seem logical that I would draw from my HSA but could my wife submit the receipts to hers?

I guess what it comes down to is, is eligibility based on whoâ€™s on a given HDHP plan when the cost is incurred? Is it based on who paid for the expense prior to the reimbursement? Does being an authorized user affect anything?

Iâ€™m just trying to make sure I understand the right way to withdraw when the time comes.

Apparently theyâ€™ve wired the moneyâ€”it has left the IRA but not yet been deposited into the 401k. This was at the end of last week, so Iâ€™m willing to give it a few days to (hopefully) completed and get in the 401k account. However, I noticed in the activity log of the IRA, it shows:

I called Fidelity because I thought that looked strange since it shouldnâ€™t be a distribution or tax-triggering event, and I wanted to make sure it was corrected if my assumptions are right. The rep told me it was done mistakenly and that he submitted a request to the back office to recharacterize the transaction as a direct rollover. He also said it might take 10 days.

I have no choice but to wait but Iâ€™m just curious to know if anyone has ever experienced this type of thing before.

And if/when it happens, will the transaction from last weekâ€™s description just get updated, or will there be new items  in the accountâ€™s activity log? I ask because presumably there wouldnâ€™t be any money movement since the money will (hopefully) already have made its way to the 401k account.

Super long story (kinda) short, I've been trying to move the balance of my Traditional IRA to my Traditional 401k for several weeks (it accepts roll ins). I created a Rollover Request (I think that's like a digital deposit slip) for the correct amount. They sent a check from the one department to the other. Fast forward two weeks, the money never made its way to my 401k....so they had to cancel the check and adjust my IRA balance again. Second shot was a wire transfer. Money never made its way to my 401k. Third attempt I just asked them to send me a a check made payable to Fidelity FBO my name. This way, I could just upload it via the NetBenefits app and have some control of the situation. This is essentially the process I needed to follow when I moved a 403b over, so I'm familiar with it. It still seems silly that I need to request a check from Fidelity made out to Fidelity and sent to me just so I can be sure it gets where it needs to be.

Anyway, today I get the check! I try to snap a front and back image with the NetBenefits app, and of course I get an error ""Couldn't capture image. We've encountered an error on our end. Please try again"". I mean, it clearly took photos of the front and back. The check is in perfect condition (and again, issued by Fidelity itself).

I called Fidelity and, as nice as the people were, they were able to offer almost no help at all. No one knew why it was happening and no one could escalate me to the technical team or a department that could help me through why their app (or something on my account) isn't working. I checked on another device too--same issue.

They keep suggesting I mail in the check, but that's exactly what I'm trying to avoid--then it's out of my control again and in the hands of the post office and Fidelity again, and I have to hope that in 10 business days they do what they're supposed to--otherwise here comes another check cancellation and adjustment (and back to square one).

Do I have any other options? I mean, I'll try the app each day for the next few days, but would a branch be able to process this for me?

Can someone who has experience with dependent care FSAs help me understand how this will workâ€¦

Iâ€™ve elected the maximumâ€”$5,000â€“for 2022. I get 26 paychecks a year (so every two weeks), which means about $192.30 each paycheck will go to the company that manages the DCFSA. Iâ€™ve also signed this form for automatic reimbursements so that I donâ€™t need to continually submit claims throughout the year.

But hereâ€™s what I donâ€™t understand. $192.30 is going into my DCFSA â€œbankâ€ every two weeks but my daycare costs for the two-week period are way more than thatâ€”so is it that behind the scenes thereâ€™s an automatic claim for letâ€™s say $500 every two weeks but they just keep reimbursing me $192.30 of it, for 26 weeks? Or is it that they reimburse $500 every two weeks (the amount of the claim), allow my â€œbankâ€ to go into the negative, and after theyâ€™ve reimbursed $5,000 (after 20 weeks in this example), then just stop reimbursing for weeks 21-52â€“while the $192.30 continues to get taken out of my paycheck?

Apologies if that explanation is confusing.  As I type it, it would seem the former is more likely but any insight would be helpful.

tb4uig,wannafightabout_it,"Should I contribute to my employer's ESPP?

Hi,

I have the opportunity to contribute to my employer's Employee Stock Purchase Plan at a 15% discount. From what I've read, a lot of people like to take advantage of the discount, buy a bunch of shares, and turn around and sell them. Yes, paying short-term capital gains tax, but still ultimately benefiting.

I'm wondering about my situation. As I mentioned, my employer offers a 15% discount, which is great. However, it's a requirement that I not sell stock for at least six months after purchasing it--and if I want to sell it just after that period, I have to notify my employer that I'm selling the stock (and pay the commissions on the sale). It would also be considered a disqualifying disposition, so my basis would be higher and I would pay more in short-term capital gains tax.

If I hold onto it for at least two years, then I don't need to notify my employer of the sale and it would be a qualifying disposition and I think long-term capital gains tax.

In general, I've read it's not a great idea to buy a lot of your own company's stock (lest they have a downturn and one could be laid off + own stock that's plummeted) and that's why many people are in favor of buying through an ESPP and selling as soon as possible...but because it seems I would need to wait a while to sell, I'm wondering if it's worth it at all--or to what degree I should be contributing to my plan.

Does anyone have any thoughts they would be willing to share?

tuuzf4,wannafightabout_it,"House Assessed Value Question

Hi,

I bought my house in 2016 for $165k. The assessment at the time was $160k and it has been ever since (which Iâ€™m totally good with!). I havenâ€™t done anything to the house in the past six years that would trigger a new assessment (like an addition etc.).

So I guess it makes sense that today, I received a letter from the town that looks like a preliminary assessment for 2022 of $216,000 (so $56k increase). It states that the new assessment doesnâ€™t necessarily mean my taxes will go up (though I canâ€™t see how they wouldnâ€™t with this new assessment). It also states that if I disagree with the new assessment, I can file a formal written complaint with the Board of Assessment Review.

My question is, how do I know if the new assessment is accurate or if itâ€™s too high? Can I fight it? What can I use to support my argument?

I wouldnâ€™t care so much but this is obviously something thatâ€™ll stick with me year after year for as long as I live in the house. I realize what I paid for my house isnâ€™t astronomical and that Iâ€™ve had a pretty low assessment for six years, but I still want to keep my taxes as low as possible.

Can anyone with any assessment experience shed some light on how easy it is to fight this and/or what I should do next?

x91rf6,wannafightabout_it,"Transferred Roth IRA from another firm to Fidelity. Is there any way to track or enter what my contributions were?

As the title states, I had a Roth IRA at a different firm for over 10 years and just recently transferred it to Fidelity. I donâ€™t think thereâ€™s a delineation between the contributions and growth in the transfer of assets, correct? If thatâ€™s the case, I can probably call the other firm and/or try to pull up all of the form 5498s. If Iâ€™m successful, is there a way in Fidelity for me to do a one-time input somewhere that my contributions were $x at the time the account came over to Fidelity? It would just be an input for the systemâ€™s (and my) tracking purposes going forward since Iâ€™ll probably have this Fidelity IRA for decades to come.

Lastly, what if I ever want to withdraw my contributions and I canâ€™t get some of the really old 5498s (from letâ€™s say 2009). If I canâ€™t get to them, how can the IRS get to them and verify the amount Iâ€™m actually eligible to withdraw?

zlq9th,wannafightabout_it,"For those who max out their 401k/403b, how do you actually indicate to your employer your intention to do so?

In my particular case, when electing benefits, many of them, like my HSA, take a fixed number, and the deductions are divided equally over my pay periods for the year. However, my 401k (managed by Fidelity), takes a percentage. Unfortunately, I donâ€™t think I have the option where my employer/plan will stop or true up in the plan so that I hit exactly the max amount.

So itâ€™s either:

1. I use a percentage based on my current salary, knowing Iâ€™ll need to lower it after merit increases (but maybe not right afterâ€”thereâ€™s probably a perfect cross section of time or times and # of percentage points to adjust at those times such that it gets closest to the max amount as possible by the end of the year).

2. I use a percentage based on what I think my new salary will be and adjust it down as best I can.

This year, late in the year, I was able to adjust the percentages twice and ultimately get within $100 of the max, but I hate having to try to run all of these scenarios to try to get really close without over contributing. I have to believe thereâ€™s a tool or approach I can use thatâ€™s easier and nets a similar result.

zqolno,wannafightabout_it,"Does there exist independent personal disability insurance brokers that arenâ€™t financial advisors?

Iâ€™ve contacted nearly 10 â€œindependentâ€ insurance brokers in an attempt to get personal disability insurance. However, each one has said, â€œOh yes, we offer that. Weâ€™ll have you talk to X, a financial advisor we work/partner with.â€

Maybe Iâ€™m just scarred from some past experiences but as soon as I hear them say financial advisor, I think theyâ€™re going to try to sell me something or have an agenda, as opposed to just looking (unbiased) across several companies that offer personal disability and recommending the best ones to me.  Iâ€™ve expressed this concern and some of the companies say â€œOh thatâ€™s what they do. We just call them Financial Advisorsâ€. I go to their website and they look like normal financial advisors to meâ€”not independent insurance agents. All I want is to get the best policy for me. I donâ€™t want anyone to take an interest in my whole portfolio and/or try to sell me something because they may benefit from it more than something else.

And just to be clear, I donâ€™t mind Financial Advisors. I think they can be very helpful. Itâ€™s just not the type of professional I expected to be working with as part of getting a DI policy.

Whatâ€™s the best way for me to have a professional look across companies like Mass Mutual, Northwest Mutual, Guardian, etc. and provide an unbiased recommendation?

Btw even these well-known companies who offer the personal DI have local branches here in NY, but their employees are all â€œFinancial Advisorsâ€â€”so even if I wanted to go directly to the source, I would still have to work with a â€œFinancial Advisorâ€.

Hello,
My husband and I are looking at houses and we would prefer to buy closer to May or June but some of what we are looking at are new builds which might need agreements earlier then an existing build. 
Weâ€™re being encouraged to get pre approved so weâ€™re ready to buy but weâ€™re also hearing that it only lasts for 60-90 days before we would have to renew. This could be 3 renewals we would need. How do renewing your pre-approvals work and affect your credit score? We donâ€™t want our credit massively damaged through this process before they run the final credit check once we are ready to get our loan. My understanding is that pre-approvals only ding you a few points and that the actual approval will big the hard big ding once you buy the property- but what about all the pre-approval extensions?

sf5d1j,whothefuckcares123,"I want to buy our next home smartly but I'm not really sure where to start...

The only property I have bought was my last condo. I bought that without kids in mind so I didn't even remotely look at schools, I didn't look at property taxes, it didn't need half the inspections a house does, and honestly, I just bought what I wanted.

We want to move to the Chicago suburbs now and I'd like this to be our long term family house where we raise kids hopefully for the next 20 years. With that in mind, I'd like to buy something where the taxes preferably aren't very high and the schools are great (are those opposites?). I want to buy in an area that is an evaluated choice.

But I feel like I'm missing something... The taxes around Chicago all seem relatively the same where I'm looking (Oakbrook-ish area for the most part, some over the boarder in Indiana (Crowne point, etc)) and yet my friend in Oakbrook was saying how she moved up the street just a few blocks and was completely overwhelmed with her new house tax bill. This is confusing to me and makes me feel like I'm missing something because when I look at property taxes online for her area, I'd think they should have been the same (despite house cost, of course).

These statements don't line up with the numbers I see online when I search ""Chicago property taxes"" which makes me think I am completely missing something when it comes to understanding property taxes...

On the schools front, I have no idea how you are confident your schools are good ones.  I see Zillow has ratings of the schools associated with the house when you look up a property but is that really what people go off of in terms of deciding which districts they want their kids schooled in?

So we went back to renting for a year to clear our minds before looking for a suburban cookie cutter home to raise a family in.

Hello. I have a new job and am trying to make my 401k elections which are due by the end of the day today.

I can only change my elections once every 6 months and come July I am having a baby and will be a stay at home mom for the rest of the year- so getting this right is important for me!

I make $40,669 a year and would like to set up my elections to contribute 81% of my paychecks so that I can have about $16k in my 2023 401k before I start being a stay at home mom in July.

However, when I put into the system that I make $40,669 a year, it won't let me increase my contribution to more then 50.4% for a total of $10,250 (because over a year that totals to $20,500)

When I lie to the system and tell it that I make only $20,344 a year, I can set it to contribute 81% of my paycheck like I would like. However, I'm not sure if John Hancock deducts from my paycheck based off solely the percentage (meaning it would take out 81% of my $40,669 paychecks for a total of about $16k by mid year) or whether it deducts a dollar amount each month based off ( $20,344 / 12 ) \* .81, which would result in only $8239.32 being inserted by mid year.

Does anyone know who has experience with this company's platform? In my previous job, I could front load my 401k easily if that was what I wanted to do. I'm a little nervous if it will error out on me but I know others of you on here are 401k maxers and may know the platform I'm discussing.

Could I consider the VTSAX money as part of the down payment if I gain money within the next year to take it out or would taxes essentially ruin that plan altogether?

I reserved a boat for my trip to Italy on Click and Boat (first time using it, basically like airbnb for boats). Was charged $188 for 8 hours for a specific boat to my my Capital One Venture X. Great, no problem. 

&amp;#x200B;

**Rental Day**

The day of the rental, I go to the boat company and the guy tells me the rental is for half day and for $145 and said the full day was not available for my specific boat. I'm fine with half day rental instead so I agree and he charges my cc. I forgot that I had already been charged the $188. So I rent the boat for half day and return.

**The dispute**

I figured I would just do a dispute for the $188 and be done, which is what i did. In the mean time, I also had emailed Click and Boat and told them the situation and asked for a refund, and they agreed with me and said the merchant also agreed with the me on the situation as well and was willing to do a refund. This is where it gets pretty sketch. Click and Boat told me to give them my bank account number so the merchant could wire my refund. I paid with my CC originally so i told them wtf no just refund my CC transaction. Click and Boat then said the merchant already talked to me privately and wired the money to my bank account. I asked for proof and they sent me some sketchy whatsapp screenshot of the merchant talking to some random person that was not me. I figured at this point, this was super sketch, so I stopped responding to Click and Boat and waited to let Capital One settle things out. Just got an email saying the case was closed and that ""the merchant provided confirmation showing no cancellation per policy was received"" and they charged the $188 back to my account.

a) change the loan type to a traditional one

b) keep the VA loan as is and use a physician loan at my next duty station to acquire a second property

My longterm plan is to continue to purchase properties and rent out the other units and rinse and repeat the above as I move each time.

Iâ€™m working on my budget and come Jan 1st Iâ€™ll have enough cash on hand to put 6k (that is 6k extra after my emergency fund) into my Roth IRA if I so choose. Iâ€™m trying to decide if I want to do a lump sum or spread that out between 6 months or the entire year. In terms of ROI what is the preferred strategy? I was thinking that time in the market for the full 6k takes advantage of dividends more but then also splitting it up keeps more cash on hand Incase of emergency as well as it could benefit from smaller market fluctuations (or be worse off because of that).

h7e6bj,Workaphobia,"401(k) loans and ""double taxation""

Some sites warn that if you take out a loan from your 401(k), the money you repay will be taxed twice. Others claim that this is a myth, and that the net effect on taxes is the same as if you took the loan from somewhere else. And others claim that double taxation is real, but only for the interest and not principal.

Would it be fair to say the following?

- The money *is* taxed twice, once when you earn the money to make loan payments, and again when you withdraw it in retirement.

- This matches how you pay ordinary loans with after-tax money, and how you would be taxed anyway on other withdrawn 401(k) earnings besides loan interest (i.e., if your portfolio had invested in stocks instead of in ""you"").

I'm unclear on what the distinction between principal and interest is for tax purposes. For the pro rata rule, assuming all your contributions to the 401(k) are originally pretax, is the repaid principal still treated as pre-tax when you withdraw, and the interested treated as earnings? What if your 401(k) has a mix of after-tax and roth contributions as well?",,,,,
hd9wel,Workaphobia,"What does it really mean to apply payments ""to interest"" or ""to principal""?

In my mind, there is just an amount $X that you owe. Every payment period you increase $X by a factor of (1 + your interest rate) and decrease it by your payment amount. But people keep saying that if you make early payments, you need to make sure the servicer applies it to principal and not to interest.

If the two are distinct, then how can you observe the difference? Do your statements distinguish between ""outstanding principal"" and ""outstanding (or credited) interest""? Is there a checkbox on the servicer's website that says where to apply extra payments?

And is there ever any advantage to applying payments to interest? How would I know if I have the right to apply payments to principal when examining loan documents?",,,,,
ie1p8c,Workaphobia,"When closing on a house purchase, confirm the actual payments match the billed costs

Let's say you buy a house for $500k (fake numbers), and your mortgage is $400k (20% down). You get a whole bunch of forms estimating your closing costs as $20k, broken out to different vendors and paid variously by you, the title company, and the bank.

On closing week, your lawyer gives you a breakdown of what the bank wired over and how it's being distributed. They wired $395k (your mortgage minus fees and interest paid to the bank, unitemized), then money was taken out for the bank's own lawyer and for the mortgage recording tax that the bank pays, leaving $390k to go towards your purchase. You're responsible for paying the seller the $110k balance, in addition to whatever you owe the title company.

But how do you know the bank didn't shortchange you? It'd be easy to deduct an extra $2k in bogus fees from the wire without you realizing, and then you'd be paying the seller $2k more than you should, while still owing the same on your mortgage. Without itemization, you don't have anything to go by but your loan officer's word.

In my case, answering the question of where they came up with the $395k figure took two lawyers, a calculator, and fifteen minutes at closing. The fact that there was no ready-to-go printout with this information, and the reactions I got when I posted this on /r/RealEstate (paraphrasing: ""lol, trust the loan estimate and closing disclosure"") make me think I'm the only one in the world who doesn't automatically assume everyone is both honest and did the math correctly.

ivdqhe,Workaphobia,"Some hypotheticals on Roth conversions

I've been looking at the math on whether it's advantageous to do conversions from Traditional IRA to Roth. This is just looking at the final after-tax money **while ignoring tax brackets, RMDs, tax implications for beneficiaries, and assuming no withdrawal penalties.** My conclusions:

1. If you're paying the taxes out of the IRAs themselves, the Roth conversion doesn't make a difference.

2. It's strictly better to pay the taxes out of taxable accounts. If you do that, *Roth conversions are better because you pay the taxes sooner*. If you instead let it grow in the traditional IRA, you'll have to pay taxes on the grown value using non-tax-advantaged funds that haven't kept up.

Here's the math. Let's suppose you have $100k in a Traditional IRA and $50k in a taxable brokerage account. All ordinary and capital gains taxes are 25%, and the growth of all investments over a decade is 100%. Cap gains aren't realized until the end.

**Scenario 1:** If you just let everything sit for a decade, you have $200k in the Trad IRA and $100k in the brokerage. After paying ordinary income on the IRA and cap gains on the growth in the brokerage, you have $150k + $87.5k = $237.5k. Nice chunk of change.

**Scenario 2:** You convert the Trad to Roth, taking a distribution of some of the Trad to cover taxes on the whole maneuver while leaving the brokerage alone. That's $25k in taxes, leaving $75k for the Roth. After a decade, you have a $150k Roth and $87.5k brokerage = $237.5k overall. You're no better or worse off.

**Scenario 3:** You convert the whole $100k to Roth, liquidating half your brokerage to pay taxes. After a decade, you have a $200k Roth and your brokerage has grown to $43.75k after taxes, giving you $243.75k at the end. This is a win over both of the above strategies.

The point is that you want to sacrifice the non-tax-advantaged accounts for the sake of the tax-advantaged ones, and do it sooner rather than later, before the relatively worse growth has time to weigh you down.

Of course, this assumes you have the taxable funds handy and that there's some breathing room in your tax bracket. *It also ignores the fact that you could be paying lower cap gains rates on your taxable accounts.*

ix5wvh,Workaphobia,"Help with understanding Vanguard fees

I'm trying to pay a little more attention to my 401(k) and had a few questions:

1. I used to have the Vanguard Target Retirement 2050 Fund (VFIFX), which has an expense ratio of 0.15%. The fund owns other Vanguard funds. Does that mean I was paying Vanguard twice -- once to pick a wide swath of stocks and bonds, and then again to manage my allocation between those categories? Does that 0.15% buy nothing more than automatic rebalancing?

2. My plan recently switched me over to the Vanguard Target Retirement 2050 *Trust*, which appears to have no fees and no ticker symbol. Is there a hidden catch or is this essentially free relative to the Fund (neglecting the expense ratio of the underlying funds)?

3. I notice that [VOO](https://investor.vanguard.com/etf/profile/fees/voo) has an ER of 0.03%, but it's ""Admiral shares"" equivalent, [VFIAX](https://investor.vanguard.com/mutual-funds/profile/fees/vfiax), has a higher ER of 0.04%.

izmzky,Workaphobia,"Does investing in REITs via an ETF diminish their advantage?

mwac7o,Workaphobia,"Witholding vs estimated tax payments

My understanding is that the underpayment penalty is computed by comparing your tax liability against the total of your timely estimated payments + your withholding.

So suppose I have W2 income with withholding, plus irregular income that I don't make any withholding or estimated payments on. Clearly I can't make a lump sum estimated payment at the end of the year if the irregular income was at the beginning of the year, because that wouldn't be ""timely"", i.e. within the specific deadline for the quarter when the income was earned. But couldn't I just put a high additional withholding on my income toward the end of the year to achieve the same thing?

Does withholding magically count as a way to stretch estimated payments out to whenever I want within the tax year? What mechanism if any does the IRS use to prevent this, and how do I know when I can skip estimated payments so long as I satisfy the 90%/100%/110% rules?",,,,,
n7yc2t,Workaphobia,"How do taxable tax refunds work?

Suppose that in 2019 you withhold $10k in state taxes, but your state tax liability is only $9k. Also suppose that you itemize, so you deduct state taxes off your federal return.

You get a state refund of $1k in 2020 for the 2019 tax year. As I understand it, that refund is supposed to be taxable in 2020 (reported via 1099-G), to avoid over-deducting money you didn't actually pay. Effectively, you defer the tax on the $1k by one year instead of bypassing tax altogether.

For that to make sense, you'd have to have reduced your 2019 federal income by $10k rather than by the actual liability of $9k. But why? I suppose it's because your $10k in withholding is what's reflected in your W-2. But don't we have all the information we need at the time the federal return is filed, so couldn't we have somehow corrected the deduction to $9k? Is it that federal return numbers feed into state numbers but not vice versa (to avoid cyclic calculations)? And if it were only based on withholding and not actual liability, how do you get credit for the full deduction if you under-withheld?

Finally, what if you itemize but you hit the SALT cap so that the difference between state withholding and state liability doesn't impact your federal return?",,,,,
nsb6zh,Workaphobia,"Risks of sharing login credentials with budgeting apps?

I really want to better track my income and spending, and I'd like to use an app (currently planning to trial Monarch Money). But I'm really averse to giving any third-party app my login credentials for any of my accounts.

My understanding is that if they get hacked and my money is stolen, I will have fewer remedies available with my bank than if I kept my login private. Can anyone confirm this?

I'm also considering sharing just my login credentials for my credit card, the reasoning being that you can't do too much damage with it. My bank account number is saved on my profile, but that would still only risk an unauthorized ACH withdrawal, to which I'd have some recourse. Does that sound correct?

Of course, all these apps and services will swear up and down that they're 110% secure because they use encryption, as if that means anything. Or because the backend (Monarch uses something called Plaid) only provides read-only access -- but that doesn't help if the backend itself is hacked.

See IRS Publication 929 for more detail. 

I thought that for a minor, the first $1,100 is tax free and the second $1,100 (for unearned income) is taxed at the child's rate, and then it's the parents' rate after that (the ""kiddie tax""). A quick scan of IRS Pub 929 (2020) and form 8615 (2020) don't seem to mention trusts/estates in this capacity.

rkw9w2,Workaphobia,"Thoughts on leveraging home equity

I'm opening a HELOC and wanted to bounce my thoughts off this community. There's two main goals:

1. Safety net to supplement my rainy day fund, e.g. in case of loss of income. (I understand the lender may close the credit line in case of loss of employment, but that's why it doesn't replace the rainy day fund.)

2. (Re)finance past and upcoming home improvement projects that I could pay off out of pocket, but would prefer not to. For this I'd do a fixed rate lock over 6 or 12 years, at around 2.6% or 3% respectively.

To elaborate on 2, I like the safety net of liquidity, and I'm expecting my cashflow to improve in a few years (cutting out preschool for two kids, and phasing in a multi-year raise from work). I also expect interest rates to rise or at least not fall, and inflation to possibly ramp up, so taking on more fixed debt now seems reasonable.

I'm thinking of managing the debt by opening up a separate brokerage account for the disbursed funds. I'd invest in something conservative like short-term treasuries or investment-grade corp bonds, the idea being to lower my cost of borrowing by a percent or so. I'd pay back the loan in equal installments, not interest-only. When I take on new projects they'd be funded from that account.  Alternatively, I could fund it by selling stocks and thereby keep the loan principal invested safely, though that somewhat defeats the point of using home equity.

I've got a $1k deductible and some ceiling water damage from a failed p-trap. Still don't know the total out of pocket cost I'll pay, but I'm getting varying numbers for when it becomes worth it to file a homeowners claim. The plumbers suggested $3-4k, my family said $2k, and the insurance company representative suggested $10-15k (figures).

When I look online for how much my premiums might rise, it sounds like ~20% is a typical or worst case scenario, while [this page](https://www.insurancequotes.com/home/home-insurance-claim) suggests that in my state (NY) ~1% is more likely. My annual premium right now is $2k, so even at 20% that's only $400 dollars a year. If we assume it stays on my record for 5-7 years, that's $2000 to $2800 total cost in raised premiums. So that would seem to indicate it's worth my while if the repair bill is $3-4k.

Does my reasoning seem sound? Can anyone share how much their premiums rose after a non-catastrophic, non-weather homeowners claim?

Also, the insurance company said that I had to file a claim in order to start the process of even sending an adjuster over. So it sounds like just seeing what they'll offer me will commit me to that approach.

So in July of 2019, I started a consulting company, single member LLC.  Most of my contracts are paid on a 1099 for my time.  Knowing that I was going to have a large contract coming in January 2020, with a large bonus that was all but guaranteed due to how well things were going, I decided to file using accrual method for 2019 to minimize the amount of taxes I would pay in 2020 since often times I get paid 1-2 months after I bill out for services.

Fast forward to 2020.  I not only had the large bonus, but several other contracts that came to fruition, but between filing taxes for 2019 and now working on this year's taxes, I'm thinking I made a mistake.  I should have filed using cash method since right now, the 1099's never match up with my annual income and there is no way to ""check my math"" so to speak.

At this point, would it be worth changing from accrual method to cash method?  If so, how complex is the process.  I have not hired a CPA just yet as I've been wanting to learn the business end of things on my own (my parents are both accountants though they have both been out of the game for years after retiring but can answer some simple questions for me) and feel I get a better idea of what is going on with my money flow when I do it myself and how to optimize taxes, etc so I was hoping to not have to hire a CPA for a few more years still...  Can I make this change myself?  Would it be easier to do with an effective date of 1/1/2021 to make it so I don't have a year partially in accrual method and cash method?

Tl;DR:  I was an idiot and invested in things I didn't fully understand.  Made a  lot of decent money, but don't understand any of the tax implications of it, or even when I will get my tax forms.

So I graduated from residency in 2019 and in 2020 I started managing my own brokerage accounts as I became self employed (in 2019).  Previously I had a 403(b) through the hospital and no extra disposable income to invest.

Now I have a SEP-IRA and  couple of brokerage accounts.  In 2020, I had no idea what I was doing  and made some really poor choices.  I ended up getting really lucky and  making a decent amount of money (in my dad's words, it was sheer beginners luck that I decided to start investing when I did -- I was getting ready to file taxes and therefore made my 2019 IRA contribution as well as opened up my taxable brokerage accounts literally at the dip of the spring stock market crash).

I'm more on the right path now, and have most of my holdings in boring index funds, but I understand that each stock I bought and sold will be taxed at my ordinary income rate of 35%.  I also bought some investments  I didn't really understand (REITs, LPs, Futures, etc) that I now understand won't just show up on a 1099 brokerage tax statement.  I am still holding onto some of these.

Schwab tells me that my 1099-b will be ready on Feb 19th, but my dad says that  I will have a lot of other forms that may come directly from the stocks/funds/commodities/etc I invest/invested in (he mentioned a K-1)  and they often come very late in the tax season.

lu2vt4,WuMedic,"Does Making an Auto Insurance Claim Cause Your Rates to Go Up Regardless of Fault?

I was reading the thread that was pretty popular yesterday or the day before about someone getting dropped from homeowners insurance for making multiple claims and I was wondering if that was the case with auto insurance as well?

I drive many miles to get to and from work (100-150 miles round trip) so it's unsurprising that over the years I've gotten into a few accidents.  (I'm also a member of a volunteer fire department, so we take a driving class every year, but even watching out for other people's mistakes, there's only so much you can do to avoid an accident sometimes!)  I had one at fault accident 14+ years ago, but never had another at fault accident since then.  I have had a few non-at fault incidents though (parked car backed into by someone I knew who let me know, parked car involved in a hit and run caught on camera-owner found with police help, car side swiped by a semi on a highway, car pulled out against a red light in front of me, rear-ended by a car on a freeway as I slowed down to avoid debris, side swiped by a pickup who failed to check his blind spot changing lanes).

However, when I do get into an accident, I've never contacted my own insurance company, and just work with the other person's insurance company directly so my insurance company won't find out about it.  The other day, a friend of mine got me thinking as he rode in my car for the first time and saw my dashcam setup.  I had mentioned that it makes claims when someone else is at fault really easy--I told him I send the other guy's insurance company the video footage and the discussion quickly goes from ""are you sure he's at fault, let's wait for all of the police paperwork"" to ""OK, how much is the damage and where do you want the check sent?""

His response was: ""Why are you working with the other guy's insurance? Submit your claim to your own insurance and let them sort it out with the other guy's insurance!  That's what you're paying them for!""

So I guess my questions are these:

1. If I am not at fault, will submitting the claim through my own insurance cause my rates to go up?
2. If I submit the claim through my own insurance, will I have to pay my deductible and any not covered expenses (rental car, missed work) out of pocket?  Or do they go after the other party for the full amount?

So I am having a bit of difficulty figuring out how much I can contribute to each.

m7ens1,WuMedic,"How to Find a Tax Advisor/CPA (x-post r/tax)

TL;DR - I have a plan outlined below for filing my very complicated taxes this year.  Is it a good one?  Also, how do I find a CPA/Tax person who can do what I need them to do/who I know I can trust?

So in 2019 I finished my medical residency program and now work a variety of jobs.  I have an LLC which all of my self-employment consulting income goes through, a couple of W-2 jobs (Direct patient care), and some investments.  My 2019 taxes were a bit complicated, but I was able to import most things through quickbooks.  I had a couple of W-2's to input but I did not have to input any 1099's due to me filing on accrual basis (more on this later).  I decided to learn everything on my own for my own knowledge, plus it helped me identify how I might be able to change how I do some things in order to try and save on taxes.

In 2020, I started some investment accounts and this is where things get wonky.  This year, I have in addition to my W-2 and 1099's/business income, a ""combined"" statement from Schwab with my 1099-B, 1099-INT, and 1099-DIV.  I also have at least 2 K-1's one of which has something about contracts and straddles, and another one which seems to have 3 nested K-1's ""Supplemental K-1 Information statement for tax year 2020""  While last year was quite a bit for me to learn about taxes, this year, it seems like an insurmountable obstacle and I have spent way more time than I should have working on my taxes.  I did it myself last year to try and learn things own my own, but I'm not sure any of the knowledge I would gain from figuring this out own my own is worth the extra time I'm sinking into this.

&amp;#x200B;

To recap, I have:

\- 3 W-2's- Business income, single member LLC from Quickbooks import (4 1099-NEC's but I don't use them since I file under accrual basis)- A handful of 1099-INTs from savings accounts- A combined 1099-B/DIV/INT from my brokerage account- A 1099-G for unemployment income (3 weeks worth when a bunch of us were furloughed at the beginning of the pandemic)- A K-1 that's relatively straightforward- A K-1 that's not straightforward and has a ""Supplemental K-1 Information statement"" that appears to have 3 nested K-1's- Maybe other K-1's that I'm not even aware of yet

My plan is to:

\- File an extension myself to give myself until October 15th to figure all of this out- On April 15th, pay the amount that Turbo Tax says I owe, knowing this is likely an estimate because the likelihood of me inputting everything correctly, especially the investment stuff is pretty close to 0.- Hire a CPA/Tax Preparer to review my tax filings (or if it's easier just start from scratch) sometime after April 15th (I don't want them to feel rushed since I now have less than a month to file, plus I want to take my time in finding someone)- Ask that same person to file the paperwork to change my filing basis from accrual to cash.  This way, my 1099's line up with my business income.  (I had initially filed accrual basis as the first year I started halfway through the year and I wanted to get December's income onto a year with a lower tax bracket.)- Discuss with that same person strategies to decrease tax liability going forward

My questions for Reddit:

1. How do I find someone to do all of this for me?  Is it like finding a lawyer or insurance agent where I just ask around/google around and then interview a few people until I find someone I feel comfortable with?  I'm guessing this has passed the point of walk down to wal-mart or a H&amp;R Block storefront and hand over my forms... I thought about doing this turbotax live thing to upgrade from my current Turbotax version, but I'm not even sure that would be sufficient...
2. Is my plan a good one where I pay my estimated taxes owed for 2020 on April 15th and then give myself 6 months to figure everything else out?
3. How much would you expect these services to cost me?

Thanks for any advice guys!",,,,,

So my main job is largely self employed, and I contribute the max to a SEP-IRA (something like $56k per year).

They match 50% up to 4% (or something like that) so I put 4% in each paycheck and the get the 2% match with immediate vesting.  Since I can go for months without working for them (their busy season is usually October through March), I just put in the minimum 4% to get the match, and the amount fluctuates throughout the year.

I am now starting another casual employed position (also W-2) with a corporation that has no match for casual employees, but we can still contribute to a 401(k) with pretax deferral elections.

I am not sure how to proceed here.  I have enough income that I won't miss 19.5k from my income and I think it makes sense at my tax bracket to take advantage of the tax advantages with the 401(k) deferral (upper end of 35% marginal tax rate), but I don't wanna max out my 401(k) since it limits the amount I can contribute to my 403(b) which has a match.  For example, if I have already put $1,500 into the 403(b) in the beginning of the year, and I put $1k in per week for 18 weeks over the summer, when I'm back in the fall to my non-profit job, I will now have 2 problems--over-contribution, and I won't be able to get my 50% match.

What's the best way to go about managing this?  Any suggestions are welcome!",,,,,
o2vwso,WuMedic,"Anyone have experience with IPOs? When is the statistically ideal time to sell?

I have the opportunity to get involved with an IPO in the coming weeks for a company that is going public.  I this case, it is what they are calling a Reserved Share Program.  My understanding is that generally, IPOs are only for large investors but this is a special program where users of the company's product(s) are afforded the opportunity to get in for a much smaller amount of initial investment than would usually be needed for an IPO.  Think of the program that Uber and Lyft had for their drivers.  (Not sure if it's relevant, but the company in question is Doximity, a social media platform for physicians and limited other healthcare professionals.  An estimated 10k-20k of its most active users were invited to participate with a minimum investment of \~$100 and a max of \~$5000.)

I've read the preliminary prospectus in pretty good detail and looked at the financials, and it seems to be a pretty strong company that is already profitable and looking to expand. Of course, as anyone who is a physician knows, any salesman that screams ""I have an investment opportunity for physicians only!"" is just looking for suckers, but the way Doximity reached out to us really seemed more of a ""Here's something we'd like to do for you for being among our first users to say thanks.  No pressure, and we won't be offended if you say no.""  I'm approaching this as a gamble moreso than an exercise in investing, but the opportunity to grow a small chunk of change literally overnight is quite appealing.

The rest of this post is all theoretical discussion based on previous trends.  This is a great time for the disclaimers for both ""past results do not guarantee future performance"" and ""don't try to time the market.""  Once again, I am not approaching this as investing. but more of an exercise in what I should do, statistically speaking.  (I would also argue that I'm not timing the market, just a single stock.)  My research shows that statistically speaking, a stock ""pops"" on average 20-40% on the first day of trading after an IPO.  Tech IPOs tend to fare a bit better.  Obviously there are risks as with every investment and it seems that about 10-20% either don't make significant gains on the first day or actually lose value.  However, my research does not show at what point do things ""peak"" during all of this volatility.

For example: At 6pm, the night before the IPO (day 0), I have to decide how much shares I want at the offering price.  (I have no lockup period, some employees and institutional investors do is my understanding ranging from anything from 3 days to \~1 month when the earnings report comes out).  Statistically speaking, does the ""pop"" happen as soon as the market opens on Day 1?  Sometime during the day? A day or two after?

Once again, caveats abound (if IPOs were guaranteed to make money, everyone and their brother would be getting in on it!), but this seems like something I'd like to get involved in to learn a bit, for the novelty of the situation, and the chance to make a quick buck in a company I believe in and who has made my professional lief a bit easier in more ways than one.

oy0sau,WuMedic,"How to Separate From ""Financial Advisor"" without losing insurance?

TL;DR - I have a disability insurance policy with a ""financial advisor"" who I no longer enjoy working with and who seems better suited for selling used cars.  Can I leave him to find someone else without losing my policy?  Also, why does my policy list someone else's name under ""your financial representative""?

So prior to leaving medical school and again prior to leaving residency, we had exit counseling sessions about financial planning and life planning in general.  Half of it was basics that you get from a high school personal finance class, but the other half was more advanced stuff related to student loans, investments, and contingency planning.  (Retirement accounts, brokerage accounts, malpractice insurance, life insurance, disability insurance, living wills, powers of attorney, etc.)  We were all encouraged to get disability insurance (and life insurance for those of us with dependents) at a minimum and there were a list of brokers our attendings use and like as well as a list of people recently graduated residents used and liked.

Fortunately, the sessions were pretty comprehensive so it meant that when I went shopping for DI and LI, it was pretty easy to comparison shop.  There are also only 5 companies that have DI for physicians with own-occupation, same-specialty protection so it was easy to price shop.  I requested quotes from all 5 companies from a few different brokers people had good experience with in the past, and setup a meeting with the cheapest.  This is probably where I went wrong.  The cheapest only had one person who recommended him whereas the others had multiple others who had used him.

When I went to the meeting with him, he was very professional and pushed a 6th option I was as of then, unaware of.  Turns out, the company he is an affiliate of, Northwest Mutual, has it's own DI which he said was comparable to the other 5 I was looking at and would be cheaper for me.  He assured me that I could go with any of the other 5 and he would be happy to help if I didn't choose NWM's DI, but he had a lot of knowledge of this product since it was his company's own product.  I asked him to send me the plan documents to review and he had already had them prepared and handed me a packet.  After a thorough reading and some research online, it was own-occ, but not own specialty so not nearly as good as the other 5.  I declined and chose one of the other 5 companies. 

Fast forward a few months, and he was having a lot of trouble getting the policy written.  I had my health exams and such so I was just waiting on him to ""do some paperwork"" but it ended up taking a long time.  From time to time, he would offer to try to get me in with NWM's own DI policy.  I had suspected that he was just stringing me along, but someone stated they didn't think so--either way, he was going to make a commission, so why jeopardize it by trying to get me into a different product for just slightly more commission when I could just walk to a competitor.  He would also try to gauge my interest in some of the other products he wanted to set-up for me (I had also inquired about life insurance, malpractice services, retirement and brokerage accounts etc) but I was getting frustrated and I didn't want to proceed with anything else until we could get at least one thing done.

At this point, I branched out.  While it would have been nice to keep everything in one place, I was worried this guy was incompetent.  I comparison shopped for life insurance, brokerage accounts, retirement accounts, and a couple of other things.  I ended up going with one broker for LI, and went with Schwab for both retirement and brokerage accounts.  I went with yet another party for risk management/malpractice services.

At the 6 month mark, he finally had a policy for me to review.  Turns out, I had a medical condition I didn't know about which made my premiums higher than originally quoted.  I was told they would reconsider at the 2 year mark.  I don't think any of the quotes were bait-and-switch.  I have since looked at repricing the DI, and the quotes I'm getting are still similar across the board.  Other than that, it was pretty straightforward, sign on the dotted line, and off I went.  He wanted to chat more about the other products we had originally discussed, but I was tired of dealing with him so I asked him not to follow-up until it was time for renewal.

Fast forward to the one year mark, and we sit down for another chat.  I renew my DI and he has prepared a whole powerpoint presentation for life insurance, retirement accounts, risk management, and a few things we hadn't even discussed.  Once again, very professionally done, but I informed him that I had already chosen other firms for pretty much everything we talked about the first meeting and I didn't see the need for some of the extra products he was selling me.  He seemed kind of irked and flustered and started going off script.  At one point he tries to tell me that while I currently have term life insurance, I really need whole life insurance too.  This was red flag number 1.  While I don't post here often, I do read this sub occasionally, and I knew I didn't need whole life.  He then went on about how I could setup a brokerage account with them with part of my assets for more aggressive growth and how their active management consistently beats the market--red flag number 2.  I know when I'm being taken for a ride and I asked to sign the DI policy and to leave.  I also asked if he was a fiduciary and he gave a cryptic answer--they have fiduciary services, and he can be a fiduciary, once my AUM hits a certain number (I think it was 500k?).  Red flag number 3.   He seemed to turn from a friendly guy into a high pressure used car salesman in the span of about 5 minutes, not wanting to let me ""walk off the lot without any add-ons"" so to speak.  I informed him that I didn't have many days when I wasn't seeing patients and I had other meetings to get to with my other vendors so he reluctantly let me sign the policy, and I cut him a check.

That was a year ago next month.  I am not looking forward to meeting with this guy again.  I have noticed that on my renewal paperwork that just came in the mail (and looking back, the initial policy issue and first renewal) that my financial advisor's name is nowhere on it.  Instead of the guy I work with ""John Smith"" (made up names) it instead says:

Your Financial representative: Mark Brown, CFP, CLU (followed by an address not even in the same city as me, but about 1.5 hours away).

Can I just go deal with Mark and not work with John anymore without having to get a new policy and go through the health check again?  Or maybe, since they said they would reconsider at the 2 year mark, it would make sense to go shopping again?

Thanks for any advice you guys have!",,,,,

pflmhy,WuMedic,"How does 0% intro APR on a credit card work?

So this is probably an embarrassingly newbie question, but my parents and high school personal finance class always stressed not ever carrying a balance on a credit card unless it was as a last resort.  So I have no clue how financing on a credit card works.

Recently, I got a piece of mail from Capital One (whom I have a business credit card through, but not a personal one) regarding an offer.  Terms are (among other things I don't think are relevant):

* 0% intro APR on purchases and balance transfers for the first 15 months with a 15.49%-25.49% variable APR after that.  There is a 3% fee for amounts transferred for the first 15 months.
* a $200 one-time cash bonus when you spend $500 on purchases within 3 months of your account opening
* $0 annual fee
* Unlimited 1.5% cash back on every purchase, every day
* Cash Back that won't expire for the life of your account

I have to pay estimated taxes due to being self employed and they are on the order of the low 5 figure range each quarter.  I'm thinking of opening this credit card and requesting a credit limit of at least the amount due for September 15th estimated taxes.  I see these benefits:

* I get a $200 cash bonus which more than covers the fee for paying taxes with a credit card
* I get 1.5% of my taxes as cash back (so on low 5 figures, a few hundred dollars extra)
* Potentially not having to pay any interest for 15 months so until the end of 2022

I've read on PF though that I just need to make sure I pay off the whole amount before the 15 months is up or otherwise the interest accrues from day 1.  Also, it may hurt my credit utilization ratio a bit, but I currently have a mortgage with no plans on moving anytime soon and a paid off car so no plans to use credit any time soon.  My understanding is that even if my car dies tomorrow, I'm forced to move for some reason, or I need access to credit, credit utilization doesn't have a memory so I just pay off the card and my utilization ratio goes back down to zero. **Any other pitfalls I need to watch out for?**  

There's no such thing as a free lunch, so I'm just trying to see what I'm missing--why would capital one want to give me free money for 15 months?  The only thing I can think of is if they are monitoring my credit usage, they can see that with my business credit card through another bank, I routinely spend $10k-$20k per month and maybe they are trying to get a piece of that pie?

I'm currently in a really shitty situation with very little resources.

Dad is financially abusive, controls my mom's money and my brother's money. He wants me to move home and work for him. That's the only way he'll support me. I don't want to work for him because he's.... abusive.... I wouldn't be an employee, so he'd just pay me with room and food. That's it. If I live at home and work for him, I'd have to get a job that he wants me to have. I have no car, I drive his car. I'm not allowed to drive to my job that's 70 miles away. He wants me to get a local job, aka something maybe 4 or 5 miles away. We live in the country suburbs... so I could work at Bojangles or Food Lion or something of that nature. He expects me to pay back $1000's of dollars of money but won't tell me how much I owe him but withholds help unless I pay him whenever he asks me. I have a lot of medical expenses, like I just had a surgery last year and I also have a tumor in my head. 

Working from home is not reliable because my dad does not respect boundaries and believes that everything needs to be his way or he'll call the police. I've physically fought my dad... he's tried to push me down the stairs when I was still in high school. He will fight my mom and my brother, too.

My closest friends are either similarly abusive or they're not in the place to help anyone. 

I received a 10 day pay or quit notice from my apartment on 03/03/2022... I owe over $3000 in rent. I'm only making $23/hour. I have two bank accounts: one is an online banking account and the other is a credit union account that I share with my mom (who's under my dad's financial abuse) and I also owe the credit union $14k so they take any money that stays in my checking account for more than a day or two. 

I just started this job, and I don't get paid until Friday, but it's a physical check being mailed out to me. It's currently being sent to my apartment, but I might not have access to that apartment later this month. I'd get it sent to my house, but my dad takes my mail and hides it.

Here are my updates:

- Lost the $23/hour job. Didnâ€™t have enough gas to drive 80 miles to work, had a doctor appointment during work, and was running on 4 hours of sleep a night for 3 days. Called my boss to explain the situation. He told me to go to the doctors appointment and that he was going to pay for me a few gallons of gas to get to appointment. I took a nap in my car while I waited for the appointment. Went to the appointment, went to get gas, the staffing company called to say I was fired. 

- I got my paycheck of $327.21 the day after I was fired. Brought food, paid my past due water bill, brought gas for the car Iâ€™m borrowing, brought some stuff at Walmart and Ulta. $15 left from that paycheck. 

- Called my old 401k company. Had $2700 in there, requested a full withdraw from the 401k. Got a $1700 check. Paid for my past due storage unit and food. I have $1300 left. 

- Surrendered my two cats to the city APS

- Posted on social media that l needed somewhere to stay. 

- Applied for food stamps. 

So I still need to rent a uhaul to move my furniture out of my apartment and into my storage unit. 

I found two possible roommates that I know of. 

Option A: Wants to live in the more expensive cities that are not around my current job, but willing to equally split rent and utilities. Looking to rent a 2 bed.  

Option B: Willing to live wherever, but only wants to contribute an unknown partial amount of rent and utilities because heâ€™s not going to be home very often due to work. Looking to rent a 1 bed. 

Iâ€™m expecting to earn another $200 this month through work. 

I struggle to keep full time employment. 30 hours a week is pushing my limit. Working before 10 am pushes my limit as well as working consecutive days. 

Still looking for a job that can accommodate my needs. The flexible jobs near me start at $10/hr for part time work. 

The food stamps case worker requested my February pay stubs. My net pay was $186.26 for the month of February.

I told my boss that I could work tomorrow but now Iâ€™m feeling sick with a sore throat, stuffy and runny nose. My friend is supposed to help me move my things out tomorrow morning before work. Financially I need to go to work but Iâ€™m not feeling well.

hk1qj3,xyeLz,"401k vs. IRA vs. Intelligent Portfolio vs. Brokerage

Hi all,

I am *not* financially savvy nor do I pretend to be; however, a few years ago I installed Robinhood and began using it to select individual stock investments. I made some lucky decisions and get in early on a few stocks with a little bit of money. I haven't made a ton, but I'm happy with my returns so far.

That being said, I've been doing a lot of online research lately. It seems the general consensus that the Robinhood business model is a little ""shady"" (I didn't say this myself, but I trust the community) and that there are better investment platforms out there. I've had a Vanguard and Fidelity account for the longest time and still do for some minor investments; however, I have transferred all of my Robinhood funds and a lot of my other funds to Schwab. So far, I'm loving the experience. That being said, there's an overwhelming amount of information at Schwab that prompted me to do further research, which made me wonder whether I'm doing everything correctly.

Right now, I contribute a little bit to my 401k (about $300/mo). My employer doesn't match, but they dump in a percentage of our salary at the end of the year regardless of what I put in. I've continued to add a little every month just to supplement this. However, I'm several thousand dollars off the tax bracket and don't anticipate using my 401k to lower my tax bracket anytime soon. That being said, I see conflicting theories all the time as to whether I should max out my 401k *before* investing elsewhere, or not. At the moment, I've been picking and choosing individual stocks and have been doing quite well (crossing my fingers for the future). I also began investing IRAs (Roth vs. traditional). Recently, I signed my wife and myself up for an Intelligent Portfolio at Schwab with the intention that we will both contribute regularly to this in an effort to grow our ""future together fund"", something like $400-600 per month between the two of us. Since we've been married, she's never liked the fact that we don't have a joint account, so I thought this would be a great way to consolidate *some* of our funds while growing them simultaneously.

That being said, I'm still really torn where to go personally. Should I be contributing a lot more to my 401k? Should I open an IRA and contribute here instead? Why or why not? Or should I continue to invest in individual stocks within my brokerage? I recently sold most of my Vanguard ETFs because the returns on the stocks were just too appetizing (and continue to pay off, but this may come crashing down depending on what happens with COVID). I love the thought of investing heavily and taking a ton of risk for big gains. I actually did a lot of crypto investing during the boom a few years ago - this unfortunately did not end well for me, but that's how you learn.

In any case, I'm just looking for some practical advise from those out there who have maybe been through this before. I'm young-ish (32), I have a somewhat cheap home, a wife and no children, and am willing to live below my means for big gains. But I also realize I'm not 22 and will likely have a family and aspirations to move into a bigger house in the next 3-5 years.

2. Between a traditional IRA and a Roth IRA is the annual maximum for both *combined* 6k or is it 6k for each of them?

hz0na3,xyeLz,"Should I dispute this charge or am I being petty?

Hi all,

I purchased some sheets from a seemingly reputable company about 6 weeks ago. In my initial email explanation to them of what I was looking for, I have in writing that I explicitly asked for ""flat sheets that I could use as my fitted sheet"" and that ""the manufacturer explained this as ordering fitted sheets without the elastic"". When I spoke on the phone with the vendor, they informed me that they knew what I was talking about. We discussed some technical details, and I informed them that it was odd that they were asking for a ""depth"" since all I wanted was a flat sheet. Since this was on the phone, it is obviously not available, but it sounds like there was a misunderstanding. The entire order was almost $700.

I recently received my first delivery and the sheets were incorrect. They contained an elastic, so the company is allowing me to ship back the sheets (obviously) for a full refund.

However, when I received the second delivery, it wasn't what I had intended. I received the sheets but they are essentially a fitted sheet without an elastic. I realize that this is what pretty much the manufacturer provided me, which is what I had informed the vendor, but it is also *not* what I had asked for. I had explicitly asked for a *flat* sheet to act as a fitted sheet. This was my first time ordering sheets, and when I spoke with the vendor on the phone I thought this was relatively clear. I literally can't use the sheets since, because they're fitted, they're made specifically for a certain size bed (they have contours around the outside that are too large for my mattress). I'm telling you, any other vendor would have recognized this since I had gone back and forth several times with them changing the size. I really just think this salesperson didn't know what they were doing.

In any case, the vendor is refusing to refund the order because the manufacturer won't take it back. They are, however, offering to sell me a new set of sheets at wholesale price. I estimate wholesale price will probably be between $300 and $400. In my opinion, this is ridiculous. I wouldn't mind so much if I could actually use the sheets I have sitting on my shelf now, but I can't. What are my options here? Should I just order the sheets at wholesale price or should I dispute the charge? Am I being petty or do I actually have legitimate cause to dispute the charge and win? I realize it's nice of the vendor to offer the sheets at wholesale price, but I feel like if anything, half the blame is on them. I'd prefer them to comp me for half the price of these sheets and then offer me new sheets at wholesale price. Is that ridiculous for me to request?",,,,,
qvfubf,xyeLz,"Is there a best order for retirement investing?

I work in Information Security and make a decent salary (high enough to disqualify me for IRAs). For the past 7 or so years I've been working for an employer that would contribute 7.5% of my total salary to my 401(k) at the end of the year. I contributed a small portion every pay period (twice a month) simply because I felt like it was the right thing to do. I recently changed employers and similarly, there's no match, but they will contribute about 15% of my salary to my 401(k). I was just wondering a few things:

1. Should I contribute to the traditional 401(k) at all since there's no match?
2. What should I do with the funds from my former 401(k)? Should I roll this over into my new employer-sponsored 401(k) or should I move this into an IRA? If going the IRA route, would I want to roll this into a traditional IRA or a backdoor Roth IRA? Why or why not?
3. My new employer also offers a Roth 401(k). Are there benefits to contributing to the Roth 401(k) as opposed to the traditional 401(k) and would you pursue this route or something else?

rk4wzw,xyeLz,"Retirement Investment Selection Advice?

I'm in my mid-30s and changed jobs recently where I had an employer-sponsored 401(k) plan and made the decision to roll the balance over to my new employer-sponsored 401(k) plan with Empower.

I spoke with a couple people for investment advice. While I realize it's a personal decision, I was just hoping to poll the audience and get a more holistic consensus.

One of the pieces of advice I got was to split my investments up. We decided on 6 different funds including an index fund, blue chip growth fund, international fund, mid-cap, small-cap, and the traditional target retirement fund. The majority percentage (60%) would be allocated to the blue chip and index funds.

Another piece of advice I got was to split investments up evenly between four funds. This included the same blue chip, index, small cap, and target retirement fund, but left out the mid-cap and international fund.

Previously, all I was doing was dumping all contributions into the target retirement fund.

I'm young and don't mind risk, and I also don't mind (and somewhat enjoy) paying attention to my funds and rebalancing as necessary. Perhaps that's not the goal of a 401(k) and that it's designed to just set and leave alone? I'm not sure. Ideally, I would be able to confidently set my investments now and not have to touch it again for 10 years.

rts6xd,xyeLz,"Is a Roth IRA the best avenue for my wife?

My wife and I are married but we file separately because she has several tens of thousands of dollars of college loans that she qualifies for an IDR repayment plan for with her income.

She used to be a teacher at a private school for many years but due to COVID, has decided to teach reading online instead (self-employed). We estimate her income over the past year to be close to $10,000 (we still need to crunch some numbers around tax time).

w1bs0z,xyeLz,"Considering rolling over 401k to IRA for one-time HSA transfer but don't want to jeopardize backdoor Roth IRA?

This is a pretty niche situation but I'm hoping someone here more savvy than me can help.

I have a 401k from a former employer that I rolled over to my current employer. According to my 401k servicer, I can only rollover the amount that was transferred, not anything that I've contributed since being at this employer. Both of these amounts are in the 5 figures.

The reason I would like to roll this over is so that I can perform a one-time transfer of some of these IRA funds into our HSA. My ultimate goal was to never touch the HSA and treat it like a retirement account, and then withdraw from it EITHER once I reached an appropriate age *or* if needed for medical expenses. We're also expecting our first child in September and our medical bills for this year have already met our deductible and then some, so at least having the option to use this for medical expenses in a crunch would be beneficial rather than having it sit in an IRA (or currently a 401k). IN BOTH CASES I would plan to withdraw the money tax free using receipts from medical bills saved over the years.

A few issues I have with this approach:

1. Right now, my employer contributes half of the max to my HSA (I contribute the remaining half) so if I decided to perform a one-time lifetime transfer, I would only want to contribute half of what the max is (otherwise the remaining half would be taxed), which seems like I could miss out on the possibility to contribute even more at some other point, for example if I changed employers and they didn't contribute to the HSA.
2. I would need to wait until the end of the year since I have been contributing the max YTD for the tax advantaged savings.
3. If I roll over my eligible 401k into an IRA, I will be rolling over more than the one-year maximum for the HSA. This means I will have money sitting in my IRA. I do currently have a Roth IRA and I have never attempted a backdoor Roth, but I liked having this as an option; however, I don't know what the complications might look like given the pro-rata rule if I proceed with this approach?",,,,,

Hello all, I am considering switching to a HSA/HDHP next year. Out of curiosity, which would you recommend more:

1. As qualifying medical expenses are incurred, keep records of the payments/receipts, but keep the money invested (this way there is a larger principle that continues to accumulate tax-free)

So, my claims were being fully covered because my script went through and I had paid out of pocket for it (later to be fully reimbursed through a rebate). After going to a few different doctors appointments and ordering/paying for my script - the prescribers office calls and says there was a mistake in my dosage and cancels my script - meanwhile other providers submit claims that I am not fully liable for due to my deductible not being met.

Shortly after buying it, I got more involved in the online finance communities and was kicking myself for not trying to get a more basic/inexpensive car.  Well, I'm thinking of ""downgrading"" my car now since the value of my car has gone up significantly, even though I put some mileage on it as well.

Yes, I know all cars have gone up in price and are going for sale at a premium these days.  However, my vehicle has gone up in value quite significantly (could possibly ""gain"" about $8k if I were able to sell by owner).

Hey all,

This might be a silly (or legit) concern but I am unsure about making extra payments on my car loan despite having the extra income to do so. I bought the car brand new (don't throw stones at me) - it's a 2019 Toyota RAV4 - and I love it. My goal from the get-go was to pay it off and keep driving it for 15-20+ years. Total amount financed was $30k but I'm down to $23k now. I wanted to buy it used but I fell in love with the new body style and have never been a fan of the old body style. Also, RAV4's hold their resale value really well so I'm not sure if I'm buying a one year used model would have made a huge difference.

I have the ability to make extra payments to the car loan every week (side hustle) but I'm paranoid to do so because I will not have equity in the car for the first year. I'd prefer the GAP insurance to pay for the difference in case the car was to get totaled instead of me footing the bill in the forms of extra payments. Is this a silly or valid concern?

Hey all,

Brief summary: I have a $17k auto loan @ 3.9% (41 payments remaining) and $20k in savings. I don't have anything in retirement because I spent my 20s getting into debt but I paid off everything except for my auto loan over the past few years, including $31k in student loans. I'm 31 years old living in SoCal. Now that I'm nearly debt free and have a healthy EF, I don't feel the urgency to get a job for the sake of getting a job - I'm looking for something that I enjoy and pays decent. I don't have a W2 job but I do food delivery at night 7 days a week.

Most of my effort and time have been going to building my businesses but it'll take time before I can make a full-time living from them.

What should my next financial steps be?",,,,,

Hey all,

I just became debt free at 31 years old - I have my 6 months EF  but don't have any savings in retirement. I'm thinking about opening a new Vanguard account (Roth IRA) and investing $1,000 into it with VTSAX before the April 15 deadline. Would this be a good move?

Hey all,

In regards to Roth IRA contributions, do you contribute monthly and invest it into the market or do you wait until the deadline to max it out and invest into the market?",,,,,
o7afek,YodaYogaYogurt,"401k Question - New Employer

Hi all,

I'm going to start a new sales job in two weeks and I'll be working from home (excited about no longer commuting in LA traffic 3-4 hours a day!). My employer's 401k plan is through Fidelity and if I recall correctly, my employer will match 50% of my contributions up to 6% of my annual salary ($37,000 base salary plus uncapped commission). I'm currently 32 years old and don't have anything in retirement since I spent the last few years getting out of debt other than a Roth IRA with $9,200 in it and will be maxing out by the end of the year.

I have decided to postpone moving out and living on my own again by a few months until the commission checks start rolling in - in order to prioritize my retirement savings. I know Dave Ramsey recommends contributing 15% of income but should I invest more in order to ""catch up""?

In regards to my Roth IRA, I will be working a second job on weekends to fund my Roth IRA so it will not be factored into my $37k salary.

Side note: I would also like to start saving for a down payment for my first home purchase.",,,,,
ovia2s,YodaYogaYogurt,"New Employer, First 401k Ever, $40k Salary

Hey all,

I just finished the first month of working remote for my new employer and enjoy it for the most part. My base salary is $40k but there's an uncapped commission. First year OTE is $65k and second year OTE is $110k+.

I can invest 12% right now and my employer will match 3% up to $1,200 first year and $3,000 in year 2 and beyond but it'll be right. I'm not sure what to do since I've never invested in a 401k. I will maxing out my Roth IRA for the second time this year and will have $12k+ by the end of 2021. I'm 32 years old, single, and debt free.

uv5gya,YodaYogaYogurt,"Crippling Financial Anxiety

Hi all,

I'm currently 33 years old and I've spent the last 4-5 years getting out of debt. To date, I've paid off $85,000 in debt (student loans, credit cards, dental debt/braces, and 50% of auto loan). I used to live alone but I moved back in with my parents in 2017 to get out of debt quickly. The only debt I have left now is my car loan of $15k. I have $12k in a brokerage account invested in a Vanguard ETF, $18k in a Vanguard Roth IRA (maxed out for the year), $9k in emergency funds, and $3k in Bitcoin. 

However, I still have anxiety about moving back out and not being able to financially support myself or losing all of my financial assets due to unforeseen event that prevents me from working, such as an illness, car accident, etc. I have been working with a therapist for the past 6 month or so and while that's helped, I still feel anxious when I think about moving back out and living in Los Angeles. 

I have thought about leaving CA and moving to LCOL but my parents are getting older and depend on me for certain things. I know I can't live with them for the rest of my life so this whole thing seems silly but any advice or feedback would be greatly appreciated - thanks!",,,,,
