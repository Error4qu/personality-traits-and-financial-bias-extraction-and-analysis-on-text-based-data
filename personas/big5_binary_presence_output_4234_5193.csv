h98opy,nolablue1024,"Avis rental car - which options are covered with Geico personal (auto and renters) and using the Chase Sapphire Reserve?

Avis has 4 primary insurance options:

Cover the Car (LDW)

Cover Myself (PAI)

Cover My Belongings (PEP)

Cover My Liabilities (ALI)


My understanding is the chase sapphire reserve covers the damage to the car so the Cover the Car option can be waived. Is anyone familiar with Geico car insurance if the Cover Myself and Cover my Liabilities can be covered with my personal Geico car insurance coverage? In addition - if renters insurance that I normally have on my apartment would cover the Belongings option? Iâ€™m reading through the different coverage policies and it is confusing. My Geico policy is in Louisiana - and I am looking to rent the car in Colorado for a week

In addition I would be traveling with my girlfriend so am not sure if any of my personal coverages would cover her if Iâ€™m the only one driving",No,Yes,No,No,Yes
i1xtpt,nolablue1024,"Understanding brokerage account bonuses and transfers [Fidelity to Chase/Ally]

I have a taxable brokerage account with Fidelity and I have seen some offers from banks I have checking/savings accounts with (Chase/Ally) that for starting up a new brokerage account, depending on the amount deposited, they have a decent bonus ($725+). A few questions for those who may have done this before:

- I am assuming there are options to transfer funds and not have to sell, accrue capital gains taxes, then fund the new brokerage. Otherwise this isnâ€™t even worth discussing 
- how does a transfer of assets work from Fidelity to, day Ally Invest? Are there any fees on either side associated with large amount of funds? 
- I wouldnâ€™t want to lose any time in the market given the potential for aggressive growth. It would probably render the bonus not worthwhile - but if itâ€™s instantaneous I donâ€™t see any downsides. If I had 100 shares of Apple would I just have those shares show up in the new brokerage account?
- I have several Fidelity specific index funds (such as FSKAX Fidelity Total US Market) - would those be unable to be transferred to the new brokerage?",Yes,Yes,No,No,No

I live in an area and market where I was always convinced I would never buy a house given my company would most likely move me at any point.

Iâ€™ve driven an 06 impala for the last decade. It wasnâ€™t until this past year where the smaller maintenance items really started adding up.

The last few years Iâ€™ve been doing the mega backdoor Roth and moving the post-tax funds all together when I reach my employers post-tax limit of $10k. Usually this has happened after Iâ€™ve already maxed out my own pre-tax contributions  

I messed around with my bonus contributions and itâ€™s going to end up that Iâ€™ll have maxed my post-tax 401k contribution limit of $10k next month, and my pre-tax contributions will still take another few months to reach $20.5k limit. 

Iâ€™m pretty sure the answer is yes, but can I convert the mega backdoor funds before reaching my pre-tax limit? I assume the answer is yes because I recall an option to automatically move the funds post-tax each pay period, but I chose not to do that as I would be limited to my employers 401k plan options.

I recognize this insurance is to cover in the very very unlikely event the institution were to collapse, but just want to understand what typical options were. Iâ€™ve got a taxable brokerage account value above the SIPC limit of $500,000, and i never really thought of opening a different account anywhere solely for coverage reasons. A few questions:

1. Is this coverage typically per account or per user - so if I opened two accounts at fidelity would I still be capped at $500k, or would it be up to a million?
2. Is it common practice or recommended to open accounts elsewhere solely for this reason if account portfolios get too big?

Per fidelity: The Securities Investor Protection Corporation (SIPC) is a nonprofit organization that protects stocks, bonds, and other securities in case a brokerage firm goes bankrupt and assets are missing.

tz8tez,nolablue1024,"Moving to MCOL area - budgeted for a house, choosing to rent for now?

I'm moving for work from a LCOL area to a MCOL/HCOL area in a few months. I've got good income ($180k), decent amount of liquid cash for a downpayment ($85k) and additional stocks ($700K) and retirement funds ($400k). I have no debts at 31 and its just myself. 

I currently rent for $1350 a month in my current city, and was planning to buy a house in the new city. I looked at a few places, didn't love anything so never ended up making any offers, and figured I'd at least rent for a bit and get a feel for the new city a bit more. I was a bit bummed because with house prices going up everything in my price range was in the suburbs or a cookie cutter townhome. I considered upping my price range but something I'd like would be around $700K and I couldn't see myself justifying a place like that for just myself 

Looking at rentals in the new area I'm probably up to $2300 for somewhere I'd like to live. I don't love the fact my rent would be almost doubling by moving, but mentally just offset it by saying theres no state income tax where I'm moving so I'll have more take home (not a wash, just a make myself feel better). 

When I look at the rental costs it kind of makes me reconsider some of those non-ideal home options such as the townhomes. The mortgage would be a little bit more than rent but I can still afford it. I don't have a strong NEED to own a home or anything and have enjoyed renting relatively hassle free and being able to move around freely. I think I'm still set on planning to rent because my new role there's a decent chance I get moved in another year or two. (Note that this has been my justifcation for each of the last 6 years in my current city and I never ended up moving or buying anything). 

With housing prices going up would be interested to hear if there's any other considerations for the rent/buy option in my situation as a potential first time buyer. Obviously no one can predict what prices will do in the future, but curious what others may do in this situation and if renting still makes the most sense",Yes,Yes,No,Yes,No

They said Nissan only allows this to be done at an authorized Nissan/Infiniti dealer.  I said what if I want to get an auto loan from letâ€™s say, Bank of America.  They said you canâ€™t, you have to go through them and pick from their list.  

I called twice and spoke to 2 different people with the same answer. 

So, do I go, buy out with the best rate they can get.  Then if I can get cheaper through someone else, buy that auto loan out from Nissan a new one?

**INCOME**

My income: 75k

Wife's income: 60k \*She is staying home this year to be with the kids, returning Fall 21. We consider her income as ""disposable (saving) income,"" and don't want to rely on it for housing payments/bills.

If we went for 20% on a house, we'd nail the student loan debt away as soon as she returned to work.

**STUDENT LOAN SITUATION**

30k federal student loans. Interest rates: 10k @ 6%, 6k @ 5%, 14k @ 3-3.5%.

**HOUSING IN NEW HAMPSHIRE**

Current ""month to month"" Rent: $1,300 (expected to rise - unsure by how much)

Payment with 20% on 300k (30yr): $1,500-$1,600 month depending on town's taxes

Payment with 10% on 300k (30 yr): $1,800-$1,900 month depending on town taxes and includes PMI

**HOUSING MARKET**

Moved here in summer of 2017 thinking things were overpriced and we'd wait and try and buy in the 250k range. Boy were we wrong. COVID made everything worse and everyone is flocking to NH. Most ""starter"" homes are beyond 300k currently. For example our friends bought in 2015 @ 250k and their house is now worth 350k no improvements.

Offers are currently 30-50k over asking, and waived inspections. We've been outbid on waived inspections the past 3 years (3 bids total as we've been picky/patient).

\--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**FINAL THOUGHTS**

I personally lean towards doing 20% as the monthly payment on a house is less daunting. Either way, when my wife returns to work we'd nail away the debt or build back to 20% as fast as possible. I guess I just worry with the current housing market that unless we have 20% we just don't stand a chance.

vn2o2t,Ok_Illustrator5129,"Got in my first car accident but unsure about cost of repairs

On my way to work this morning, I pulled into the parking lot and a 17yr kid hit me on the passenger side. My 2002 Honda Civic took pretty good damage on the fender and front bumper. His 2013 bmw barely took some damage. I took photos of the damages, his car insurance but didnâ€™t have DL on him and I seen his name wasnâ€™t listed on the insurance paperwork. Just his dad and two other people. He wanted to have me fix his repair and he pays mine and I was like no Iâ€™m calling the insurance company. When he left, I called right away, gave them the info and said theyâ€™ll call me tomorrow. Iâ€™m a little worried because if the cost of repair is more than the car, are they just going to pay me out on what the cars worth? I also did a bunch of mechanic repairs for it too..

2002 Honda Civic EX with 200,400 miles, new rebuilt transmission, clutch, ac compressor, catalytic converter because it got stolen recently. Will they pay for those? Highly doubt it.

Iâ€™ve never experienced this before so Iâ€™m a little unsure of the process and annoyed because I have to figure out how Iâ€™m going to get to work in the meantime.

Thereâ€™s a lot of social pressure for everyone to buy a house when they can. I was currently planning on buying one soon as well but now Iâ€™m having second thoughts about doing so.

Iâ€™m currently a 25 year old single guy. My total gross annual income is about $110-120k. I expect to get promotions every couple of years or so for the next decade or so so my compensation should grow about 5-10% a year on average until my mid thirties when promotions will become less frequent.

I currently have about $250k saved up. $150k of that is in a taxable brokerage account and the rest is in retirement accounts. I currently save about $50k/year including all employer matches and incentives.

So I feel like financially I can buy a house especially if I save for another year or two, but Iâ€™m not sure if I want to yet.

I really enjoy where Iâ€™m renting now. I really donâ€™t have anything negative to say about my apartment and the community Iâ€™m renting in has a lot of great ammenities and neighbors. In addition, I moved into my current place in the middle of the Covid shutdowns so I got a great rent rate. It did go up by 10% when I renewed my lease but it is still far below the market rate for what the same floor plan is listed as on their website. If I move out I lose that below market rent rate. I really wouldnâ€™t mind living here for a few more years at least.

My next argument is that if I bought one, I would need to use most of my liquid net worth for down payments, closing costs, and initial repairs and renovations. I feel like the opportunity cost for doing so will be huge down the road. I can easily triple my net worth or more by the time Iâ€™m thirty if I keep saving $50k/year like I have been and the market grows 10%+ year.

This small regional bank has some nice things going for it. Theyâ€™ve consistantly grown their business over the years.

They have a ~3% dividend, and typical issue a 5% stock dividend each year. They have a price to earnings around 6 right now. Theyâ€™re around the same stock price they were 3 years ago when they were making half as much annually. Finally, my personal favorite, I contacted their investor relations and the CFO emails me back with answers within 24 hours.

This makes sense as there were a lot of restrictions with the PPP (limit on company distributions for instance) making it a less desireable option for business owners if you could get something elsewhere.

poalt5,ORCoast19,"Thoughts on investing in energy &amp; inflation with OXY/WS?

Iâ€™ve been buying OXY/WS this month, kicking myself for not buying them a year ago when I first learned of them. OXY/WS is the cheapest way to invest in OXY if you believe the share price will go up significantly. They essentially give you the right to buy shares at $22 plus the current warrant price. You have up until Aug 3 2027 to exercise this right. These warrants were issued to OXY shareholders during hard times in 2020, to throw them a bone, but I imagine most bailed as the stock collapsed. 

Four reasons I like this play areâ€¦

1. Rising Free Cash Flow. Occidential petroleum has been benefiting from an increasing WTI crude oil price, hovering around $70/barrel as of today. Last quarter it averaged around $65/barrel, and they had cash flow in that quarter above 2 billion (market cap is currently ~24.4 billion for reference). Cash flow should continue to increase as crude price increases, and they work to pay down their crippling debt.

2. The Crippling Debt is Going Away. No one likes debt, right? Especially crippling debt that might bankrupt you in a sudden, extreme downturn? *cough* Covid 2020 *cough*. Apparently management got the message that their debt load could kill them, and have a plan to reduce debt by over 40%, planning to drop from 34 billion in debt at the end of 2020 to 20 billion in debt at the end of 2022. As debt gets paid down the current interest payments of 300+ million/quarter will reduce to under 200 million/quarter, adding over half a billion extra to their free cash flow!

3. Inflation Hedge. OXY has a lot of hard assets, and if US inflation takes off their stock should rise. An example of these hard assets can be found in their land holdings- they own over 1.35 million acres in the permian basin alone. If inflation is high over the next 6 years, I feel the time value of OXY/WS is being very underappreciated. As of today that time value is under $6 per warrant. 

4. Future Energy Needs. Going back to the permian basin, the land that oxy has might one day be reused for alternative energy. Believe it or not, massive solar projects can hit a wall due to environmental groups. Belowâ€™s a link of this issue recently cropping up in San Diego County. For some reason, I donâ€™t think Texas will give a damn about environmental issues, making that previously mentioned 1.35 million acres in the permian basin prime real estate for massive solar projects. In addition to solar potential, OXY has also been working on CO2 sequestering using their pre-existing oil drilling footprint.

Hey Everyone, 
I wanted to get folks opinions on NWN. NWN is a natural gas and water utility provider based primarily in OR and WA. P/E at todayâ€™s close is around 15, and revenue has been increasing low-single digits in recent years. 

Things I like about them include:

- I lived in OR for several years and was both a residential and business customer of theirs. I know their CS is top notch / mailed statements professional /emergency response *fast* (less than 30 mins on a Friday)
- They should be pretty COVID proof, and they have a regulated monopoly. Folks need heat and theyâ€™ve been supplying since the late 1800â€™s.
- They advertise in their annual reports that they have one of the best maintained systems in the country.

Things I donâ€™t like about them include:
- Being a mature utility, Iâ€™m told these trade like bonds at times, and a shift in interest rates can shift their price up (on interest decrease) or down (on interest increase). 
- The NW seems to be having more weather related issues than say the midwest or northeast. For instance, wildfires in OR have been bad in recent years. I actually evacuated my house in 2020 because of them. Thereâ€™s also been droughts making wildfires more likely. Buying into NWN exposes you somewhat to these regional issues, and if it gets bad enough people move thats less customers.

rc2mhe,ORCoast19,"VCSA went public this week

Hey Everyone, 
Vacasa, a vacation rental property management company, went public this week. If anyone is interested in them I wanted to share some of my industry experience on them and VRs in general. I competed with them in OR for 6 years and have met dozens of their owners and employees. 

On valuation, after-hours they were trading at a 4.13 billion market cap for ~30,000 properties. This equates to $137,700 per managed unit. Competing with them and other companies in Oregon, most small companies would sell for between $10,000 and $15,000 per unit. The company I worked for was a bottom dweller, and got some units below $7,500 at times. Theyâ€™re expecting 1.25 billion in revenue for 2021 with part of the year having Turnkeyâ€™s acquisition baked in. This means revenue per house is somewhere north of around $41,666 per house before they split out their fees, which isnâ€™t that bad. 

As this type of business scales the margin gets better and better. Managing 200+ units I had net profit margins before taxes around 10% for every dollar of revenue taken in to be split between owner and PM. At vacasaâ€™s scale I could see them getting this north of 20%. If they were just milking the business for cash/avoiding huge IPO-related management bonuses this would put their net profit EBITA at around ~250 million with the 2021 revenue numbers. Doesnâ€™t sound that bad, right?

The downside is theyâ€™ve made a bad name for themselves, and I think organic growth will be hard to come by. Hearing from old employees, management was pretty oblivious to field conditions and field staff member complaints. In a business like this, field staff is ~80% of your employees so imagine ignoring 4/5 of your employees. I recruited HKâ€™s from them all the time due to payroll issues, overwork, and scheduling favoritism. On the owner front, a guy with a townhome in Newport, OR actually reported they left a leak unchecked that caved in his third floor ceiling. Iâ€™ve signed owners further up the coast that found meth and needles *after* their cleaning team had gone in and completed a post stay clean. Operational issues seem to continue to grow but they keep scaling. 

From a revenue perspective, much of their growth stemmed from underpricing the competition dramatically when they started up. This worked for ~5 years where they were able to produce better owner returns due to price undercutting, but competition responded. Now, most owners will produce the same or less compared to homes managed by local competitors. A homeowner I signed from them, one of the first 200, summed it up by saying thereâ€™s too many homes pulling from the same traffic. They havenâ€™t scaled customers as theyâ€™ve scaled, diluting homeowner results. 

In summary, I think the operational issues will limit organic growth, and their profit potential wonâ€™t be realized because management isnâ€™t hungry. Why would you be, being the biggest vacation rental pm in the US? 

Iâ€™ll be a buyer around $2/share, or higher if they step back from their growth plans and focus on their ground game.

Iâ€™ve been looking for cheap stock and found Stellantis recently that I think fits the mold. Pros are:

- Transitioning to EVs and realizing great synergies from a recent merger. 

Cons are:
- Paying a heavy dividend of over 7%. Iâ€™d rather see them reinvest or buy back shares. 
- Based in Europe. Adds complexity to taxes. The company handles revenue in Euros and is more exposed to the russian-ukraine situation than non-european manufacturers.

Donâ€™t yall find it interesting that Berkshire bought 25 billion in energy stocks this quarter? Mostly CVX but some OXY too. Not only that but Clayton Homes, a subsidiary of berkshireâ€™s at the annual meeting, unveiled a net-zero energy home. I walked the net-zero home at the exhibit and it was pretty nice. They had a trash can outfront showing the minimal waste. But at ~242k+ including the solar panels the 3 bed, 2 bath was a big shift from the last home I saw showcased by the company. In 2017 they had one that was ~75k+, a 2 bedroom 2 bath. Its almost like the company believes energy is going to be expensive in the foreseeable future.

I have 2100 shares of OXY and 500 shares of SHEL feeling the same way. The space has chronic underinvestment, and large projects started now will take 5-10 years to get online.

I felt pretty confident at that time because I have about a decade of industry experience, which included competing with them in three different markets (OR, NC and now AZ). 

$VCSA is a shitshow at times- Iâ€™ve personally sold PM services to owners whoâ€™ve reported meth being left from guests after cleaners have gone through and a whole 3rd floor collapsing due to an unaddressed leak to give a few stories. But hereâ€™s the thing, the vacation rental business is very complex. Even at small managers you have issues. We had a housekeeper go crazy in a 180-unit PM and put holes throughout drywall in a house sheâ€™d locked herself inside. The business will always have â€˜chaosâ€™ to some extent because guests are unpredictable, staff can be unpredictable, and shit happens. 

So that all being said, Iâ€™ve started buying $VCSA at these levels, knowing all the good and bad that comes with it. With its current market cap and units under management the price per contract is under $20,000 at this point which is cheap. For comparison, my first employer sold their business a year ago for north of $35,000 per unit to private equity. They had a 220 unit portfolio vs $VCSAâ€™s soon to be 42,000 unit portfolio.

ek077s,OutdoorJimmyRustler,"Help Understanding Arbitrage Concept and Theoretical Scenario

I figured some of the bond traders on here might be able to gauge my rationale behind these assumptions.

Many cities across the United States are issuing Pension Obligation Bonds (""POB's"") to pay down pension debt.  In most cases, cities are members of a State-administered investment pool.  Cities are required to pay into the investment pool based on a formula that is multiplied by the quantity of employees that they have in the system.  The pension recipients have promised benefit amounts (defined benefit).  If the State-administered fund fails to make a return that is high enough to cover the increasing costs of benefits, the State basically charges cities to make up the delta.  This is becoming increasingly common.  Usually, cities do not have the money up front to pay this delta, so it sits on their books as an Unfunded Accrued Liability or ""UAL."" 

In California, the State-administered pension system charges municipalities that have a UAL *interest* on the UAL principal based on the State-administered pensions system's estimated investment return.  If the State thinks they can make a 7% market return, they charge municipalities a 7% interest penalty on their UAL principal.  The State does this because if the municipality had actually paid the UAL up front, the State would have taken that UAL principal and made an additional 7% on it.

In response, cities in California have been issuing POB's that have a fixed interest rate of 3-4%.  They pay the UAL principal down, avoid having a 7% interest rate (in place of the lower 3-4% interest rate), and save money in the long run.  

1. Is this what *arbitrage* is?  Taking out a loan for 3%, thus *""*making"" 4%?  

2. The 7% charge from the State pension system in California fluctuates.  There's talk of the State lowering that return projection, which could mitigate the savings made by cities that issue POB's at 3-4% interest.  As such, opponents of this strategy have attacked the rationale behind POB's.  In theory, the State pension system could make a negative return.  When that happens, cities get charged to make up the difference between the assets of the funds and the liability of payments owed to pensioners.  In theory, a city could take out a 3% POB, pay their UAL, and receive a negative return on a huge principal in the short run if the market crashes.    My response to this has been that since we have to pay the UAL anyways, it makes no difference if we pay it now or later.  No one can time the market (certainly, municipalities can't), so it makes do difference if we pay the UAL when the market is growing or contracting.  Thoughts on this?",Yes,Yes,No,Yes,No

I'm trying to work through what I owe (if I do) in federal  taxes (and specifically long-term capital gains or ltcg) for '22 and trying to determine whether I owe estimated tax.  Background details:

1. Single Filer, in my 40s  and assume no previous liability from prior tax years
2. I had income from a part-time, temporary job for a portion of the year:  $7500
3. My W2 shows I paid $235 in federal taxes for aforementioned income (also paid approp state tax)
4. I took distributions from my IRA to assist with  my  Advanced Degree study (early contribution exempted from penalty bc its used for tuition): $21,094
5. From the IRA distributions above, I withheld $3000 for Federal Taxes; in addition I also withheld for state taxes at my state's local flat tax rate.  (Looks like I overpaid on Fed Tax)
6. I cashed out on long-term stock (&gt; 1yr)  I owned through a taxable investment account at various points throughout the year.  Total Gains from stock sales: $30,000. 
7. Assume no short-term gains (ie $0)

&amp;#x200B;

Here's my understanding of the total tax I owe on Ordinary Income (OI):

1. Combine W2 and IRA Contributions:  $37500
2. I'm taking the  standard deduction for this example which I believe is  $12,950 for '22.
3. Determine Taxable Income:  $37500 - $12,950 = $24,550
4. That would imply that my fed taxes due on OI would be: (10% \* $10,275) + (.12 \* $14,275)  = $2740.5

LTCG Taxes:

Based on  [this](https://www.fiphysician.com/capital-gains-stack-on-top-of-ordinary-income/) explanation, my understanding is I wouldn't owe taxes on my LTCG  because the total gains are less than $41,675   (the page is old and the tax rates are outdated but I'm trying to follow the formula).

I know it allows you to specify whether you'd want to choose from mid-land America or coastal region, but wasn't sure if there were further refinements/control over where your money went.

Secondly, when selecting an investment plan,  does any other option really make sense other than supplemental income since this seems to be an illiquid investment? From the research I've done, it seems like this wouldn't be something you could easily sell off after  say 5 years.  

Finally,  with the pandemic, is there a good or better time to buy into this?",Yes,Yes,No,Yes,No

oqycv2,outskirtsofparadise,"IRA Distribution for health insurance

Iâ€™m resigning from my company and will be out of work for a little bit.  My university (enrolled in a graduate program) offers healthcare insurance and wanted to know whether it would be considered a qualified expense if I took a distribution to pay the premium?  I wanted to confirm I didnâ€™t need to be layed-off/let go to qualify for this scenario.

Also, if I pay for the insurance but I find a job and use the coverage from my future employer, would I have to pay a penalty? How would that work if I was off I no longer stay on the plan?

p1gl6s,outskirtsofparadise,"IRA Distributions for Higher Education Expenses

Hi All,

&amp;#x200B;

I live in MI, I'm under 59.5 years old and plan to fund a graduate program from money I've accumulated from my ira (bypassing student loans).  I had a question  that I was hoping could be answered without having to spend $500+ talking to a tax advisor.  

 A representative from the financial institution acting as custodian to my  IRA  informed me that I did not need to pay quarterly taxes on IRA distributions  and that that money could be paid during tax season (this was communicated without any deep conversation about what I've paid out this year).  I just wanted to confirm if this was others' understanding.  I'm doing some digging but can't seem to find anything that suggests that on the web.  Not sure if this is a unique case for education or whether this is even accurate.  If there is a provision for educational qualifying expenses bypassing estimated or withheld taxes, does this provision hold true for state tax as well (Michigan) despite documentation indicating they require withholding ?

Up until the beginning of this month, I was working full-time and was paying between $580 and $600 on each paycheck ( 4k gross/$2700 take-home). Not sure if that facilitates addressing the question.

qdgswz,outskirtsofparadise,"IRA Focused Conversion Question

Iâ€™m 42, currently in grad school and unemployed (I worked the first half of the year).  Iâ€™ve worked the last couple decades, and decided to change careers (hence school).  Iâ€™d like to withdraw from my IRA and keep enough money on-hand so I can ensure I have living expenses in case of prolonged unemployment.  Iâ€™ve made about 4 distributions from my rollover to cover tuition (which I understand is qualifed).  

Aside from a SEPP which I donâ€™t want to do, I was thinking I could do a one-time focused conversion and put a portion in my roth (Iâ€™ve had the roth since I started working two decades ago).   Then I could withdraw the contribution, thus only be taxed at my normal rate.

sbvpmh,outskirtsofparadise,"Tax Question about IRA Contribution for Qualified Education Expense

I'm 42 not currently working but in grad school.

&amp;#x200B;

I've been withdrawing (and withholding taxes) from my Rollover IRA to pay for Grad School - I've not made distributions to myself for any other reason.  Unfortunately, I signed-up for a payment plan which had a fee associated to it and was rolled into my tuition expense.  When I received my 1098T,  the total amount reported was short this charge.  Now, my distributions look like I overwithdrew (by $60) compared to the amount I owed the school.

Is there any way I can get out of paying the pre-penalty due to the payment plan charge?  

Not sure if it helps but I withheld 22% from these contributions for Federal and 4% for State (current rate) each time I was invoiced as I had worked a majority of the year and quit prior to starting last fall.

scjvix,outskirtsofparadise,"Question about the 0% tax bracket on capital gains

Hoping for a sanity check...and I'm **NOT** arguing whether it's a good idea to cash out on investments in general....save that for another topic.  That said,  does it make sense to cash out on long-term investments (with realized gains) at the beginning of the year to take advantage of the 0% tax bracket for that type of income?

In other words, if I cash out on the first business day of the year on investments I no longer wish to keep, I could potentially take advantage of not having to pay any tax  on long-term gains (even if I expect to have ordinary income through the year)?   So, basically I can cash out on as much as $41675 (if I chose) tax-free before I even earn my first paycheck.  I understand that that pushes me up on my ordinary income tax bracket but the fact that I can have earned income without taxes seems like a benefit and should be a standard consideration every year.  

Am I understanding this correctly?",No,Yes,No,Yes,No

Last year, I rolled 403b money over from a prior employer to my rollover ira.

wb36oc,outskirtsofparadise,"IRS Obligations on gains when brokerage (Voyager) seizes assets during Chapter 11

I was wondering about the following scenario ( I am not in this position but I've read how others are):

You have $200k  in crypto on a platform like Voyager.

You are receiving interest on the coins every month

Some portion of the portfolio is used to execute short-term trades based on crypto volatility.  In doing so, you accrue gains from buying/selling.

Voyager announces that they've suspended trading and have restricted your access to assets.  You are not able to do anything with crypto or money for the remainder of the taxable year as Voyager restructures.  They were (are) able to do this because their terms of service stipulate that you are pledging any assets you transfer to their platform.

Let's assume the investor's gains for that year (from trading + interest) are near 10k

For the remainder of the  year, the investor doesn't have access to either the principal or the gains. 

What options does this person have when filing federal taxes for that tax year understanding that they will most likely only receive a fraction of their assets back when the dust settles (though that's not know at the time of filing)?

xc3obo,outskirtsofparadise,"Bank Bail-ins and Brokerages

I've been reading up on bank bail-ins, which to my understanding is a means for banks to convert your savings as assets on their balance sheet  (making you an unsecured creditor) to keep their operations going. Assuming bail-ins went into effect, I could see the following situation arise:  bank accounts would be frozen and or with-drawls restricted for a period of time while  banks stabilize operations.   I was wondering how this would affect money in brokerage accounts. Would I still be able to access:

1. money in my investment or cash account that was not part of a bank sweep but invested in a money market fund. In other words, if bank accounts were frozen, could I still access and sell money market funds, and use the proceeds freely?
2. money in fidelity's fcash position in their investment account, which I understand is not fdic-insured and basically operates as a holding tank for buying and selling funds, depositing dividends, etc. I presume since this is not FDIC-insured, it's also not subject to the same restrictions that banks have or require.

Please note: I'm not interested in debating the merits or probabilities of bail-ins occurring. I'm just curious whether these options could alleviate limits on access to funds should something like this occur.  TIA.

10v7zqx,paulrudder,"Does anyone recommend reducing/pausing 401k contributions while getting out of consumer debt?

I'm paying off some consumer debt - car loan (almost there), credit cards (hopefully by end of year), student loans (this will take a while and is less of an immediate priority but still on my agenda).

My company offers a 6% 401k match that I take advantage of. I was previously contributing 3% to an employee stock discount program also, but just paused that. Painful to do with the current downtrend in the market as I feel like I'm getting a fire sale but every little bit helps. With taxes, medical, 401k and employee stock, almost 50% of my pay was being removed from every paycheck and that's a tough pill to swallow.

 Besides pausing the employee stock contribution for the time being, I was thinking of temporarily reducing or even altogether pausing the 401k match. This is what Dave Ramsey recommends but i just can't bring myself to do a full pause - feels like I'm throwing away ""free"" money for my future. That being said, if I did it for a few months it would help me more aggressively tackle the credit card and car loan.

What do you guys think? Does it ever make sense to pause contributions to speed up debt payoff? Should I maybe roll back from 6% to even just 4% or something for a short period so I'm still getting a partial match?",Yes,Yes,No,Yes,Yes
11n2zr2,paulrudder,"Can someone help me with a tax question?

So I'm using TurboTax, and in 2022, I received $1 in a crypto token via Robinhood's ""Learn and Earn"" program.

When I imported my data directly from Robinhood into TurboTax, it auto-populated this $1 under the Wages and Income - Form 1099-MISC section.

However, when I get to the last step to review my return before filing, it keeps flagging this form and saying I have it reported as miscellaneous income but it isn't reflected elsewhere on my tax return (or something to that effect). i guess I am super confused why I would *need* to also claim it elsewhere on my tax return if it's already being accounted for under the 1099-MISC section.

Does anyone happen to know what it means / what it's looking for, or whether I need to claim this twice on my return for some reason?

There's a whole separate section in TurboTax to manually enter miscellaneous income, which I did for unreported crypto staking rewards i received from other crypto exchanges that didn't generate tax docs. Maybe it's flagging it because I don't have it reported in that section? But that doesn't make sense to me since it got auto imported via Robinhood.",Yes,Yes,No,Yes,Yes
11ns6yl,paulrudder,"Tax question I can't seem to find the answer to: Can I delete $0 sales from my 1099-B?

I tried posting this on r/tax and didn't get any replies, so I thought maybe someone here might know.

I'm using TurboTax and imported all my crypto transactions from 2022 via CoinTracker, which auto generated a 1099-B listing every single transaction.

I guess because I earned weekly ""Staking"" rewards (similar to interest or dividends) through exchanges like Coinbase, I have small transactions for fractions of tokens being received for $0. Just as a hypothetical, let's say I bought 999.95 XLM tokens (a pretty cheap coin) and staked them... each week I might have received 0.005 XLM's as a ""reward,"" but each of those distributions have a $0 value because they're practically worthless.

When I sold/disposed of some of these holdings later on, CoinTracker automatically accounted for every single lot I ever received of each coin, even though many of these micro transactions of received interest/staking were virtually worthless.

So for example let's say I sold 1,000 XLM, and 999.95 of those were what i originally purchased, and the other .05 were the total of all my staking rewards for the year... It's showing on my 1099-B a ""sell"" transaction for *every single staking lot I received,* and every single one of them has a $0 value. 

Because CoinTracker is reporting and tracking every single one of these $0 staking rewards, they are showing up on my form 1099-B, so I have a bunch of $0 sales listed. TurboTax is flagging these as an error and asking me to adjust the cost basis, but I can't, because they are essentially worthless. I guess TurboTax is confused because normally if you're selling something it has a value, but in this case each lot is so small and miniscule that there's literally no dollar value attached.

All this being said, I'm assuming I should just go ahead and delete anything that is $0, correct? I don't need to document sales of small lots with a worth of $0? Even if all those lots combined added up to a few cents, it's not like I'm going to get in trouble for not claiming them, correct? I'm assuming as long as I have anything of actual dollar value accounted for then I should be fine?",Yes,Yes,No,Yes,No
12jop68,paulrudder,"Removing PPI from my mortgage -- is it worth doing now, or should I just let it fall off automatically?

I purchased my home for $144k in 2019 and I've paid down the principal to $135k. A decent amount of my monthly mortgage payment goes towards PPI which I'd love to have removed. I'm in PA and my understanding is that it automatically falls off after you reach 20% equity in your home? Which in my case I think would mean paying it down by about $30k.

But the estimated value has risen exponentially over the past 4 years and it says it's worth at least $200k now and I know homes have sold for around $220k on my street.

So my questions are:

* if I just make additional payments on the principal will it automatically fall off once I pay it down by that \~20% number?
* is it worth paying for someone to come out and do an evaluation of the property, and if they estimate it's worth more and I already have 20% equity in the home, would I be able to send that info to my mortgage lender and they'd basically just remove the PMI?

14xv0fp,paulrudder,"Should I cash out stocks to pay off credit card debt?

I feel like I know the answer to this already but just need people to tell me â€œyes.â€

I made some stock investments in 2020-2021 when my income was a bit higher and my debt was lower. My credit cards have increased substantially the past year and although my income will be higher the remainder of this year, I just hate carrying the higher balance.

I could cash out some of my stocks right now for minor losses, and immediately pay off one of the card balances, but I keep thinking â€œwhat if the market rallies and the stock 5xâ€™s?â€ - which I know is not really the right mentality to have and feels more like gambling.

17my242,paulrudder,"Should I cash out stocks to pay down credit card debt?

It's embarrassing to admit but I have about $25k in credit card debt at the moment.  Fortunately half of that is on a 0%apr transfer card, and the rest is on a relatively low interest card (13.99%).

I was making more money in 2020-2022 and just got hit with a lot of setbacks this year, including medical expenses blah blah... end of the day it doesn't really matter, but I started relying on my card more thinking I'd be able to pay it down with each month's commission check, but then there was always something random and unexpected that would set me back further, like an $1800 vet bill. 

All that being said my income is decent at about $100k/yr... but after taxes, medical deductions, 401k, etc. I have only netted about $55k this year. So at first glance it sounds like I should be able to pay off this debt ASAP with my income level, but the reality is I'd have to pause my 401k contributions to really increase my take home pay and there's not much I can do about high taxes and medical insurance deductions.

I have about $5k in company stock and $1500 is currently eligible to cash out. I'd hate to do it with the market the way it is right now but I realize it could also downturn further next year if we do enter a proper recession. I guess I was looking for some advice on what I should do.

I would hate to pause my 401k but do you guys think in the short term it would make sense for a few months?

i really don't have that much in the way of frivolous expenses, but it's just me with a dog and a cat to care for, a mortgage to pay, a car loan (almost paid off) and now $350/mo in student loan payments starting back up so it starts to feel spread very thin. My biggest out of pocket expense each month is absolutely on groceries. I rarely eat out, never Doordash, etc. -- that's why it sucks to have so much credit card debt... I don't even feel as though I'm buying lavish things. I never go on vacation. I try to budget, but there's just always something that sets me back. I really don't know how people get by these days because I always thought if I was making six figures life would be easy, but I still feel very much paycheck to paycheck.",No,Yes,No,Yes,Yes
17wpsg4,paulrudder,"Looking for financial advice on which of these medical plans I should choose for next year

Which of these medical plans would you guys pick in my shoes? Iâ€™m looking for objective advice from a financial perspective.

I have to choose between a Pay Later or Pay Now medical PPO plan for next year through my employer.

Pay Later is $49 biweekly and has an $800 deductible and $4000 out of pocket max in network, $7500 out of network max, and copays for doctor visits are $5 more.

Pay Now is $67 biweekly but features a $500 deductible, a $1500 out of pocket max in network, $4000 out of network max and doctor copays are $5 less.

Iâ€™m generally healthy in my 30s but had a scare with a cyst on my kidney last year. The first MRI results were reassuring but my urologist does want me to go back and get a second MRI in spring 2024â€¦ so Iâ€™m going into next year knowing Iâ€™ll have to pay for the MRI. I do not know whether that would be enough of an incentive to pay for the Pay Now plan so I have a lower deductible and out of pocket max depending on the MRI costs.

Besides that I donâ€™t really foresee too many medical expenses. I was thinking of trying to find a naturopathic doctor but they donâ€™t usually take insurance anyway. But maybe that would go to my out of pocket max? Not sure how that works.

esjyie,paulrudder,"Is my homeowners' insurance going to go up because of this?

I made another topic earlier in r/HomeImprovement and got some good feedback. TL;DR version -- someone threw a rock through my double pane window last night and it shattered the outer pane. Didn't notice until this morning, called the police and the guy who came out told me to check with my insurance company and see if there's a deductible for vandalism since I'm basically S.O.L. in terms of them catching whoever did it.

I didn't realize I have an insurance *agent* that I'm supposed to contact first (only been a homeowner for a year), so I called the insurance company directly and explained what happened to the rep. He told me he would have to pass it along to their claims department and have someone give me a call. I reiterated that I wasn't interested in filing a claim at this point but just wanted to know what my deductible would be... and he said he couldn't tell me until they looked it over. I feel like he pulled one over on me because I later found out that by passing it to their claims department it was processed as a claim.

Someone in the original topic about the window damage told me that this could go on my account history, and that I should have called my agent first for advice. So I found my agent's info and called them and they told me to call the insurance company back and cancel the claim. Called them back and it had already been assigned to some guy in the claims department. Got his voicemail. An hour later he emails me back and says he canceled the claim for me. I replied and asked to clarify whether this would go on my account history and he said he couldn't tell me that, and that for rate-related questions I needed to ask my agent.

Called my agent back, and she told me I'll probably be OK since it was canceled so quickly and that she wouldn't worry about it, but that she won't be able to tell for a few months and that the best time to check is when my policy is due for renewal and we can address it then.

SOOOO basically today has been a nightmare from beginning to end and now I'm worried that my premium is going to go up next year even though I very clearly stated from the onset that I didn't want to file a claim. I guess I should have known about how agents work, but quite honestly I've never had to go through anything like this before, not even with my vehicle (knock on wood).

ew43er,paulrudder,"I get paid commission (sales) and had 30% taken out for taxes; is this standard?

Sorry if this is a stupid question. I will delete it if I'm an idiot for asking haha. But it's hard to use tax calculators I found online because they are usually based on salary or hourly, and my income is largely commission.

I was really stoked to get a big pay check tomorrow because I made the most commission of any month and achieved my annual budget, so also got an additional bonus on top of that. And because there were three pay checks this month all my medical was already taken out of the last one so I thought less would be withheld. Long story short my gross pay was $6800 and I just got my pay stub for tomorrow's direct deposit... And it's $4600. Still a lot and I'm grateful regardless but I just thought it was a bit less than I had expected. But I'm also fairly naive when it comes to how taxes work and that's why I thought I'd ask here.

When I look at my net vs gross pay for the year so far it says 31% has been withheld for taxes so maybe that is right in line with where it should be?

ewqdao,paulrudder,"Is it possible to deduct the expense for LinkedIn Sales Navigator when I file taxes? (I work in sales.)

I work for a major telecom company, and my role is in outside sales. Despite trying numerous times to make a case for LinkedIn Sales Navigator (which is a prospecting tool that is *awesome* for finding leads and bypassing gatekeepers, but also happens to cost $60/mo annually and $80/mo without contract), my company won't allow me to expense the cost -- most likely because if they allowed me to, then every sales rep would want to across the nation. They also have licensing agreements with specific software/websites (like AdMall) so I would imagine it might be against some kind of pact they have with them, but that's just speculation.

Anyway, I really, really love the tool and actually made a sale with it in the past for $6k/year, so I know it works. But I hate the idea of paying that much money out of pocket each month. Yeah, it could very well offset its cost if I bring in even just a couple big purchasers -- but it's still a little tough to swallow a $720 price tag.

So my question is -- I know in the past when I use TurboTax it will ask if I have work expenses and receipts. I usually don't put anything in, since my company will reimburse me for small things (e.g. if I needed to buy a charger for my work phone, or something like that). But would I be able to itemize/deduct a substantial cost item like the membership to LinkedIn Sales Nav?

f6erqf,paulrudder,"Having trouble figuring out W4 allowances - my employer doesn't have a worksheet for it.

I'm in debt, trying to pay it down as aggressively as possible. I listen to Dave Ramsey and he always tells callers not to have any extra tax withheld from their pay checks because it's basically giving the government a free loan all year.

I went into my employer's HR web portal and clicked on my tax withholding, and it just has a box to enter ""number of exemptions."" Initially I believe I had 0 exemptions for both state and federal. Right now I have 2 for federal (changed it in December based on the advice of a coworker) and 0 for my state (which is PA).  However I don't know if 2 is too many, too little, etc. -- I don't want to owe money but I also don't extra withheld. I was afraid to touch the state exemptions because I wasn't sure if it worked differently than federal.

I've Googled how many to claim, and the pages always say to fill out the employer's tax withholding worksheet. The problem is my employer doesn't have one. It's literally just a page that lets me change the numbers without any explanation of what they do or point of reference.

First of all, let me say how great it is that this subreddit exists because I've had a couple tax related questions pop up recently and you guys have been able to point me in the right direction. I'm really grateful for that!

I work full time and received a form 1095-C last week. From my understanding it's proof that I had employee provided health care. Turbo tax has an input section for the form...

I received two 1098 (mortgage interest) forms for 2019: one from the original loan provider, and one from Freedom Mortgage.

I paid $599 in interest to the original loan provider, but the form they sent me has blank fields for everything else -- e.g. where it says ""outstanding mortgage principal,"" it is blank. Points paid is blank (even though, from looking at the copy of my closing disclosure from Dec 2018, it shows that I paid 77 points at closing, so I'm assuming I should list the 77 points since I never claimed them for my 2019 tax returns?).

The other form I received from Freedom Mortgage has full details for everything and all the boxes are filled in... but Turbo Tax will NOT let me submit my federal taxes until I fill in the ""outstanding mortgage principal"" for the original loan.

I was contacted with an offer to refinance @ 3.625% FHA, same loan terms (30 years fixed)... but due to closing costs and all that fun stuff, it would actually raise my balance to $143,420.

Now, I do plan to stay in this house long-term so I know it probably makes sense to refinance... but it's hard for me to stomach seeing the mortgage balance increase to above where it was even initially, and quite honestly I'm not sure if the lower interest rate is appealing enough to make it worthwhile yet.

For the past year I've been actively paying against my credit card debt. I'm embarrassed to say I had it up to $30k at one point (long story - combo of immaturity, lack of budgeting skills and quite honestly a depressive period where I felt defeated) but I've wisened up, learned a lot, and am on a written budget now. I've brought it down to $18.5k at this point with no frivolous spending, but it's been tough and I have had the Murphys Law setbacks, e.g. I switched to a cheaper car insurance policy but didn't realize it had to be paid in full for the entire year in cash, so suddenly my $80/mo insurance budget was an $850 bill. ðŸ˜‚ Then I had someone throw a rock through my living room window and had to shell out $350 for repairs...

Anyway, my remaining balance is spread across three cards, one of which is a promotional zero balance APR but it's set to expire in November and my other two already expired. I believe the interest rates are 10.99 and 20.99.

I was going to open another zero balance card and transfer them but they typically hit you with fees for doing so. Instead, I was thinking of getting a personal loan to pay off the majority of the remaining balance.

Discover offered me a 60mos loan for $15k @ 10.99 apr and I was considering taking it.

Probably a dumb question.

I understand you have to pay roughly 30 percent tax on stocks sold under a certain time period (I think a year and a half?).

I just learned today that if you sell a stock for a loss and repurchase it within 30 days, you can't account for that loss on your tax return?

I'm wondering if anyone knows whether robinhood and turbo tax automatically handle this. The reason I ask is that I pay a premium each year to import my robinhood data automatically into turbo tax and it calculates everything for me, so I don't have to manually calculate my gains and losses. 

I'm not a day trader, but I may have sold and rebought stocks within 30 days before. I'm just worried whether this will automatically be negated when I file via turbo tax or if I have to manually keep tabs on such a thing?

qa0ayb,paulrudder,"Does anyone here have familiarity with cryptocurrency taxes? I have a question about trading one token for another

I might go to a tax accountant next year for peace of mind, but I'd also like to know now so that I can make sure I'm recording transactions properly. I also worry that accountants in my conservative town may not have a clue about this topic lol. 

It's my understanding that when you ""swap"" one token for another it's a taxable event since it's technically a sale of one asset for another.

My situation is this: I usually just buy and hold with Fiat dollars on Coinbase, but I decided to buy a promising up and coming token that is not yet available on Coinbase and cannot be purchased with US dollars. Basically the only way to buy is to ""swap"" bitcoin or USDT (a stable coin tied to the US dollar) for this new crypto coin. 

So, I withdrew about 60 XLM coins (roughly $23 usd) from my wallet and sent it to another app called Kucoin. I then sold the 60 XLM for ~$23 USDT (again, this being a stable coin but not actually USD) and *then* used that USDT balance to purchase this new coin. 

Now, I guess my question is this: when I sold my 60 XLM coins for USDT, there's probably a cost basis involved... But since this is taking place on a different app from Coinbase, how do I ""consolidate"" or calculate those numbers? In other words if I was buying XLM repeatedly over the past year and then I ""sell"" 60 of them (even though I'm technically just swapping them for another coin to turn around and buy another), how do I calculate my cost basis for tax purposes?

Let's say I bought some XLM at X value last year, some more at Y value this year, and now I just sold *some* of my total balance at Z value... Would x be my cost basis? 

Are there any apps or programs you guys recommend that might be able to do this for me?",Yes,Yes,No,Yes,Yes
qao27k,paulrudder,"Is now a good time to invest in Disney stock? Or should I just buy an index fund?

Curious to hear everyone's thoughts on this. Barclay's apparently downgraded Disney today due to slowed growth of Disney+ this past quarter and the shares have taken a small tumble as a result.

I own a handful of shares since first purchasing this year, and was planning to continue buying and hodling long term just because it seems like a no-brainer of a company to invest in and I was also looking at their future pipeline in terms of the theme parks reopening and their Marvel/Star Wars etc. properties and acquisition of Fox. 

By the same token, since it's a major blue chip stock and already has a massive market cap, I'm not really sure if it even makes sense to buy as a single stock or if I should just invest the money into index funds that would naturally have Disney holdings and might have higher annual returns...?

I do already hold S&amp;P stocks and my 401k is heavily comprised of a Fidelity SP500 stock, so that's why I'm hesitant to not diversify somewhat more.

I'm thinking of changing this so that I keep everything the same but reduce the S&amp;P to 75% and putting 5% into an international fund. There are international stocks in the 2055 retirement fund, but I figured for diversification it might not hurt.

I've heard folks say, 

* your home's price should not be more than 3x your gross annual income
* your home's monthly expenses should not exceed 28% of gross monthly income

If these two bullets hold (do they?), then one could quickly setup what the financial limits of their home purchase would be.  Great.

* 8% of gross towards monthly car costs
* 25% of gross towards monthly retirement investments (across, 401k, IRA, and taxable)

shugt5,PizzaThrives,"Buying out my car lease. Seeking help.

Hi all! Hope this is the best sub for this discussion. Here is the deal:

I am about to finish year 3 of a 4 year car lease. I live in Florida. My leasing company is Ally. 

I am interested in buying my car out of my lease ASAP. 

Why? 

Because I would be financing the buyout and if I wait till the end of the lease, interest rates will likely go up. 

Because leasing or buying a new car would be based on current prices which are inflated. 

Because the residual value of the car would be under the market value, so I could keep it or even sell it in the future if I wanted to. 

Because I think my monthly payment would go down and it would help with budgeting. 

Here's the situation:

1. I called ALLY and they told me that in Florida they are not allowed to sell me the car directly and that I have to do business with a dealer (any dealer). 

2. A friend of mine who also lives and leased in Florida bought his lease (with a different leasing company) and claims he didn't have to speak with a dealer and even did everything over the phone. 

What are my options?  
Is it true that I must go to a dealer? If yes, does it make a difference which dealer?

Ok, I know this is really idiotic but here goes: I make 290 gross and want to know if I can afford 5-6k/mo for an apartment. I live and work in NYC. 

Please note the question is CAN I AFFORD IT, not why do I dislike mice... 
 
A few years ago, I bought my NYC apartment Iâ€™d been renting for ages when my landlord decided to sell, and I intended to retire there. Great area, nice place, quiet, nice neighbors, CLEAN, high ceilings, good sun, right price. Emphasis on the clean. Maintenance only $1100 (low for my area). 

I have an extremely serious mouse phobia and it was a key thing when I bought it that Id never seen any vermin, which is rare in NYC. 

So during covid with a lot of restaurants closing and buildings vacant, including one right next to mine, all of a sudden I see a mouse in my apartment. I had my super repair some holes under the sink and three weeks went by and I saw another one (or the same one, larger). So I had a pest home sealing service come and also collars put on the risers, but there are no guarantees and mice could still get in through the heating system and a/c, front door, holes under shelving and holes over kitchen cabinets. The problem is, others in the building are having this issue and it is still not solved. The management company changed personnel recently and they changed exterminators also. 

Ive been staying with relatives ever since seeing the second one but itâ€™s a bit crowded. Some will say I shouldnâ€™t be afraid of mice, but I am and for me they are scarier than a gas leak. I loved my place but having thought about it for a long time I just will not feel relaxed there anymore. Even if I never see another one I will be nervous and on edge. 

I looked at other places to rent and nice one bedrooms in luxury buildings (with no mouse risk) go for $5-10,000, and those are the reasonable ones!!

So thatâ€™s the issue, can I afford to rent something nice for a year or two until I decide whether to sell, keep or rent out my apartment? Should I stay with relatives until the building resolves this issue? I can get about 600k now if I sell it. 

Or should I just leave NYC if I get a WFH offer because the money here and quality of life no longer makes sense for me? I donâ€™t have contacts elsewhere. 

I currently spend only $45k a year so this would increase it to $110 and I gross 290 but want to retire in the next 5 years (Im on track).

Does it make sense to set up a revocable living trust for when you are alive, and as beneficiaries give moderate amounts to people who have helped you, and make donations?

pemty8,Plain_Chacalaca,"Max My 401k-Should I Open a Traditional IRA? - Over Income Limit to Deduct

Ok people, this is pretty basic but here goes:

Question: Do I open a traditional IRA or a taxable brokerage account, or both? If so with whom?

I max out my 401k and my catch up contribution every year. I only started my 401k in my mid-40s, 11 years ago, because my prior employer didnâ€™t match and I wasnâ€™t comfortable investing before then. I just saved aggressively. Iâ€™m planning to retire in the next five years and am on track. 

Iâ€™ve never done an IRA. Iâ€™ve always been above the income limits to qualify to deduct my contribution. A backdoor Roth is too complicated for me and I donâ€™t want the hassle. 

Iâ€™ve never done a taxable brokerage account either. Iâ€™m not interested in or comfortable with investing so Iâ€™d just start small with some basic indexes. 

My choices are: TD Ameritrade (I bank with TD)
TRowe Price - my 401k is with them
Fidelity 
Schwab 
Vanguard

Any suggestions welcome.",No,Yes,No,Yes,No

14uy4ck,PM_ME_YOUR_CATS_PAWS,"Would like some feedback on budget

Hi everyone -

Well, I just bought a house. Of course Iâ€™m very nervous as a FTHB seeing the new expenses on paper is of course scary. And Iâ€™ve never lived on my own before.


I make $2250 every two weeks, this is after all deductions and taxes. $2250 is the amount that hits my bank account.

In those deductions is enough money to max out my 401k. Put some money into an HSA as well.

My house payment will be $1750 a month. This is including the taxes and insurance.

My only other debt is student loan debt, which is a couple federal loans and a private loan. Total monthly payment is $525, rates vary between 3.2% to 4.2%.

I budgeted $400 a month for food as a single dude. I need to stop eating out so much as itâ€™s incredibly unhealthy. My work also buys my lunch, so that covers one meal for 4 days a week.

Iâ€™ve factored in other stuff like utilities, car insurance, and stuff like that. I can provide more detail if needed.

My checks will increase by about $150 after taxes next year without a raise. This is because Iâ€™ll have cheaper insurance and can lower my per paycheck 401k deduction and still hit the max (I missed the first couple paychecks due to having to get everything set up this year so Iâ€™m playing catch up essentially)

Iâ€™m anticipating when the new taxes kicks in on the property, itâ€™ll raise the monthly to $1900/month

How is this looking? To me it feels like itâ€™ll be fine, but could just use some assurance. My company also pays out bonuses. My target rate is 15%. My guess is with the economic situation, the bonus will end up being closer to 10% and itâ€™s paid in April of every year. I did not factor this into any calculation. Bonus is just extra to me.

Where should I look to cut if necessary? Should I cut back on the 401k to get more cash flow? Say cutting it down to $15,000 a year instead of the full $22,500?

Appreciate the thoughts!",Yes,Yes,No,Yes,Yes
15hmab8,PM_ME_YOUR_CATS_PAWS,"Where to proceed from here?

Hi PF, 

Long story short, I purchased my first home! Which of course introduces the new debt of 6.875% for a 210k mortgage. Wondering how y'all would approach my mix of debt.

For context, I max out my 401k and intend to max out my Roth IRA.

I am paid every two weeks, for the purpose of my budget I used 2 checks a month (which means 2 pay checks totaling $4550 cash are unaccounted for, as is my annual bonus which can range from 6k after taxes to 11k after taxes.

&#x200B;

My mortgage with property taxes and insurance is $1925/month (no PMI).

My student loans are a mix:

Federal Loan 1: $3500 @ 3.2% (monthly $15)

Federal Loan 2: $5900 @ 3.5% (monthly $35)

Federal Loan 3: $3700 @ 3.2% (monthly $25)

Federal Loan 4: $8000 @ 4.2% (monthly $50)

Private Loan: $48,500 @ 3.5% (monthly $400)

These rates are the historical rates before the interest rate went to zero. I am operating under the assumption that these will be the rates come next month. The monthly amounts are also based on the graduated plan I was on at the time.

&#x200B;

Again, my only other debt is my new mortgage, $210,000 @ 6.875%

&#x200B;

168y45z,PM_ME_YOUR_CATS_PAWS,"Now that federal student loan interest is back, how would you approach this?

Hi all - 

Can now see the interest rate on my student loans and trying to figure out the best debt to approach.

I am late 20s single man. No kids, just two pets.

Salary is 110k, I am paid biweekly, but I budget my monthly stuff on two checks so I have two ""extra"" checks a year. I max out my 401k so my bring home after all deductions and taxes is $4600 a month.

My bonus is target of 15%, but its likely to be more like 10-12k this upcoming spring.

I intend to continue to max my Roth IRA every year as well.

&#x200B;

My debts:

Mortgage of 212k @ 6.9% (total PITI is $1925 a month), brand new mortgage as I just got the house two months ago.

Federal Student loan debt broken out in five different loans, I currently utilize the ""Graduated Plan"" so the monthly amounts will go up in 24 months (about $6-$10 per loan):

Loan1: $3500 @ 4% ($21/month)

Loan2: $6000 @ 3.5% ($35/month)

Loan3: $3700 @ 3.5% ($22/month)

Loan4: $4100 @ 4.2% ($25/month)

Loan5: $4000 @ 4.2% ($25/month)

I also have a private student loan of 50k @ 3.5% ($400/month)

&#x200B;

Once I have my initial small projects done (mostly cosmetic stuff) for the house, I will still have enough cash for an emergency fund, which I intend to put into an online HYSA (recommendations for who to use for HYSA is welcomed, right now I am looking at SoFi).

&#x200B;

Since the mortgage is a high dollar amount, I was thinking of paying loans 5 and 4 off quickly and then roll into loan 1. After that I am not sure if I should hit the 50k loan or the mortgage.

The housing payment hurts, but I needed to move. I was living with my parents and the house got crowded with a sibling and their kids moving in. Part of me feels bad for leaving the free setup I had (I did stuff around the house for them to compensate) but hindsight shows if I didn't buy when I did, between rate hikes and the surge in my local home prices, I would have been priced out, or living in a super shady area. Not too relevant to the numbers but needed a slight vent lol.

kr8745,PM_ME_YOUR_CATS_PAWS,"Can I afford to buy a condo/house?

I'll try to keep this as brief as possible while providing all the numbers.

I currently make 74k (this may bump up to 80k with a new job soon, but sticking with the 74k for now).

I (24) live at home with family but it is admittedly becoming more and more stressful, sadly. My biggest bills are these:

Car: $290 a month, balance of $9500, 4.25%

Car insurance paid semi-annually comes out to $165 a month (love living in MI for car insurance! /s)

Private student loan: $1200 a month, balance of $60k, 3.6% **Note: I pay an extra $900 here every month.**

Federal student loans: no payment currently due to covid. usually $125 a month total (these are several smaller loans), rates ranging from 3.2 - 3.4%.

&amp;#x200B;

My retirement is actively being funded with a balance of $4500 in a 401(k) and another $25,000 in IRA's.

&amp;#x200B;

Here's where my thought process is, I have a quote for the private loan for 15 years 3.9% to bring the monthly down to $450. I could do that and use the extra money plus liquid cash (about 18k on hand) to pay off my car and save $290 a month, my credit union recalculates the loan when paid ahead, so if I wanted to pay half of it off now they would adjust the monthly payment to basically finish the loan on schedule on the new balance.

&amp;#x200B;

I am assuming rates for a mortgage would be about 4% give or take a little, my credit is 740 but i feel like the large student loan balance will pull me away from the rock bottom rates. I do not carry a credit card balance, it is paid in full each month.

&amp;#x200B;

Living in MI, housing is pretty cheap. A nice area I could get a good condo or home for 180 - 200k, I've had bank tools tell me I could afford 250-275k, but I know that is way beyond what I could realistically afford without being house poor. I am keeping an eye on possible smaller condos for the range of 130-150k (think \~800 sqft) I am just worried about resale value on these as I won't be able to grow into it and would seller it earlier than I would a condo or house that is slightly larger.

&amp;#x200B;

An alternative is to take the $900 extra off the big student loan and put that on my car now, but I feel like a $1200 payment is unsustainable when owning a condo/house.  

&amp;#x200B;

My budget shows I should be able to afford this with several hundred dollars left over each month but I am concerned I am missing something since this would be such a big step. I've included the utilities I can think of: phone, internet, cable, water, electric, gas etc. Though I have seen some condos that have gas/water included in the HOA fees (the HOA fee is also apart of my budget).

m9jj1i,PM_ME_YOUR_CATS_PAWS,"Need opinions on which loan term

Alright, buckle up, this will be a long one but I want to be as thorough as possible here.

24M, single, living with my parents currently.

Income: $78,000. 

Location: LCOL Midwestern metropolitan area.

Investments: 30k in retirement accounts with another 2k to go to reach the annual max on my Roth IRA, another $8500 in a normal taxable account. These are down currently but in decent holdings and nothing terribly risky just been a rough month for a couple holdings.

Debt:

Federal student loans: 21k, currently not paying due to relief. Typical payments are about $200/month before COVID. Rates vary between 3.2% - 3.4% if I remember correctly.

Private student loans 55k, 3.6% interest for 5 years (about 4.5 remaining on it), minimum payment is $1100/month, I am currently paying $2100/month on them.

Car loan: 9k at 4.25% interest, payment is $275/month, currently paid ahead so technically I don't need to pay for a year on it, but I plan to wipe it out by end of summer anyways.

No other expenses outside of your normal car insurance, gas, etc. 

&amp;#x200B;

Now that you have a clear picture of my financial situation, lets get down to the real question.

&amp;#x200B;

I am looking to refinance those private student loans, the issue is I am not sure what type of term I want to go with. My offers are:

15 years, 3.51%, $395/month

10 years, 3.31%, 545/month

7 years, 3.19%, $730/month

5 years, 3.16%, $1000/month

&amp;#x200B;

Here's why I am struggling to pick between these, all of which are lower than my current 3.6% rate:

I really like the ultra low rate of 3.16% and the idea of paying way less in interest. However, I would like to move out soonish, I've been looking at the time frame as early as this summer, or as late as next summer, with the fall of this year being a rather ideal time. In addition to that, I am not sure if I will be staying in my current location or moving to a city in Florida (not Miami/Ft. Lauderdale area, but don't really want to name it to keep this somewhat anonymous). According to most cost of living calculators, it seems my targeted area in Florida is about the same as my targeted area if I stayed in my home state, so while it would be more expensive than staying home, those two options are essentially the same price. My current state has an income tax whereas Florida does not, which is also a small thing to consider but is not my reason for relocating.

&amp;#x200B;

I am not sure whether the $1000 a month plan is really feasible once I start assuming my own living expenses or not. While one option is to take the 5 year plan now and refinance again prior to moving, I fear rates may start to increase and thus the longer term rates would be higher at that point in time. Obviously no one can predict the future, so it's rather hard to mathematically account for it. 

&amp;#x200B;

So I guess the crux of this is, what would you do? Pursue the ultra low rate or accept a rate slightly higher (but still lower than your current rate) to give you more room to work with in pursuing a goal to move.",Yes,Yes,No,No,Yes
op1c6z,PM_ME_YOUR_CATS_PAWS,"Am I covering all the basics? What exactly can I afford house wise?

I am sure you're all tired of the housing related questions, but I would like an outside perspective to make sure I am thinking all the way through this.

Currently I live with my parents, rent free. I am saving for a house right now in a relatively low cost of living area (MI).

&amp;#x200B;

I am contributing to my 401(k) to receive my full employer match. Below are my monthly numbers after all withholdings and deductions.

&amp;#x200B;

**Income:** $4200

&amp;#x200B;

**Student Loan Payments:** $520 at a 3.5% interest rate.

&amp;#x200B;

**Car Payment:** $275 at a 4.25% interest rate, this is paid ahead until the end of next year, but I have $6000 to go. The car is only a couple years old and has super low miles.

&amp;#x200B;

**Car Insurance:** $150, yes I have already shopped around and priced what this could be if I adjusted my coverage after paying off my car, $150 seems to be about the floor as I am only 24 in a state known for high insurance rates.

&amp;#x200B;

**Gas**: I would say I spend about $75 in gasoline costs.

&amp;#x200B;

**Food:** I probably spend about $200 a month on average on food, maybe a bit less, moving out I expect this to go up a bit. Admittedly it is currently made up of eating out, but when I move I plan to make my own food much more often as I'll have the space to.

&amp;#x200B;

Outside of miscellaneous fun-spending, I don't have any other major bills.

&amp;#x200B;

Asset wise I have $37,000 in retirement and another $10,000 in a taxable account. The retirement will be increasing substantially now that I have a new employer with a more generous retirement plan. I also have $20,000 in cash and will be seeing a one-time influx of cash this month of about $8000 after taxes.

&amp;#x200B;

With all this being said, I would like to purchase a place (either condo or SFH) in 3-6 months, but for the purpose of this exercise, lets assume it is in 3 months.

&amp;#x200B;

I know for a fact I won't have 20%, and I am okay with this and the PMI it will incur. 

&amp;#x200B;

First thing, I am wondering how much I should budget for utilities. Currently I have this drawn up.

Cable and Internet: $150

Electricity and Gas: $140

Water: $30

Phone: $50 (yes this isn't in the original expenses as I do not have to pay it while living at home)

an incremental increase in food of $250 ($450 total food costs)

Is there anything I am missing? I know the HOA for a condo will be one thing if I go that route, but aside from that, anything else?

&amp;#x200B;

I am trying to narrow down to what my PITI payment (+HOA if applicable) can be and still be comfortable so I can work that into what price range I can realistically afford.

&amp;#x200B;

If you think any of my projected expenses may be off based on experience, please let me know. For the purposes of this exercise, let's assume a $15000 down payment. I do not want to draw on my Roth IRA as rates are so low I feel as though I am better off keeping that money in the market and taking the slightly higher PMI.

Retirement accounts:

401k, I max this out throughout the year. To get my full employer match, I need to put at least 10% away. Currently set at 24% being put away. Currently 8k balance (just started this job a few months ago).

Roth IRA, I max this out every year too. Current balance 30k

Rollover IRA made up of former employer retirement account: 20k

Taxable brokerage account: 22k.

Private student loan debt: 50k, 3.5% rate and $400 minimum (longer payment plan, 15 years).

I am currently on a 15 year plan for 3.5% for $400 a month. My options are the following:

&amp;#x200B;

5 years, 2.3% at $945/month

7 years, 2.5% at $700/month

10 years, 2.7% at $515/month

15 years, 2.95% at $375/month

20 years, 3.25% at $310/month

There are no upfront or refinancing fees, so nothing to account for there. I invest my excess cash after maxing my Roth into a taxable brokerage and have about 20k in there. My cash emergency fund is fully funded as well.

I do have family/friends here but am not opposed to packing up and leaving. I really do love my job and my co workers as well. 

I currently live with my parents and have very little expenses. Pay $1000 per month to my parents for my school loans(0% interest) and pay for my groceries/gas(\~400/month in total). I'm a rather frugal person and don't spend much as it is. I have a newer car, which is fully paid off. I have no credit card debt with a credit score of 805.

I can move anywhere in the country with my job and make rather good money(probably less than NYC) but the cost of living here is absurd(house pricing and taxes on houses). I'm torn between moving to a cheaper place with a significantly decreased cost of living(NC, Texas etc.) as opposed to staying here and saving a large amount for a house.

Honestly torn between saving up a lot more for a downpayment here and still having a large monthly payment(mortgage/taxes) and moving elsewhere for cheaper cost of living. I'm a rather simple person and don't require spending a lot to have fun. I go on vacations with credit card points. I would rather live well below my means and invest my money into a broad index fund instead of spending 20-30% of my salary on living expenses.

Should I place my money in a taxable account if I plan on buying a home in the next 1-2 years or is there too much volatility to this?

Hello everyone! I'm currently a  25 year old making \~120k a year(during COVID for the past like 8 months) and am living with my parents in a high cost of living area(westchester, NY). I really want to move out of my house but my take home pay is 57% after taxes(NYC taxes, city i live in taxes, federal taxes etc) meaning I take home about $68,000/year($5700/month). $1000 goes to my parents to pay off a 0% interest loan for school. I put 1650 in my 401k to max it out.

&amp;#x200B;

Is it okay to stop contributing to my 401k as i REALLY want to move out to save up for a rather high down payment on a house or should I just stick it out and continue contributing to the Roth 401k while saving for a downpayment? I do not have a match of my Roth at work. I also contribute the max to my backdoor roth IRA.

\~29% of my take home pay goes to my Roth 401k which I think is rather high given goals right now. I'm rather frugal and save \~80% of the rest of my money I take home. Currently have $44,000 between my retirement accounts and \~29k in a high yield savings.

&amp;#x200B;

TLDR; Can i stop contributing to my 401k to save for a downpayment for a house making 120k/year in  a high cost of living area at 25 years old? ",No,Yes,No,No,No

ewtwo1,poqwrslr,"Tax Question: repaid income not reflected on W2

I had a job where part of my compensation was ""student loan repayment"" equaling $10,000 annually (or $384.62 per paycheck).  This ""student loan repayment"" is treated as income by the federal government and therefore subjected to all the same taxes that regular income incurs.  Therefore according to my understanding, while it can titled whatever my employer wants it is ""income"" by the federal government and treated as such.

I left this job early 2019, I believe my last day was 01/11/2019.  With leaving I was required to return a portion of the ""student loan repayment"" equaling $8,000.  In 2019 I earned a total of $8,274.88 from this employer.

I recently received my W2 from this employer and it shows the full wages of $8,274.88 without taking into consideration the $8,000 I repaid in mid-February 2019.  My employer is refusing to correct my W2 saying it's my job to deal with it on my taxes.  This difference in income results in an approximate $2,000 swing in my taxes (employer also screwed up my tax withholding on the $8,274.88 of income) + excess Social Security withholding they need to refund to me in the amount of $496.

So, in trying to deal with it, I have discussed with an accountant who agreed the returned $8,000 should decrease my 2019 wages by that $8,000.  Therefore she recommended trying to go back to my employer and again requesting a corrected W2 (which they are still refusing to do), or to submit a ""substitute W2"" using form 4852 which will of course trigger a review of my taxes and also any documents submitted by previous employer.

I have the copy of the ""student loan repayment"" agreement from when I was hired, including the emails showing the agreed upon $8,000 I repaid, the confirmation from my employer of them receiving and depositing the $8,000, and then of course a copy of the check showing payment/deposit in my bank's records.

Before I file my taxes using form 4852 (assuming my employer continues to refuse), can anyone give input on if this is correct and if there is anything else I should be doing?",Yes,Yes,No,No,Yes
eyu3rn,poqwrslr,"Finance vs. Cash for ""new"" vehicle

Disclaimer: I know this question has been asked thousands of times, but unfortunately the search function brings up those thousands of results and it is quite difficult to sift through them.  So I apologize in advance.  If you want to link previous posts that apply please do!

I also read the wiki, and while it gives good advice on the process and preparing ahead of time, I didn't see where it specifically answered this question.

\---

Basically, my wife and I are expecting to purchase a newer used vehicle in approximately 12 months.  We have 1 kid, with another on the way.  While we could probably make our current vehicles (small to medium SUVs) work, with 3 dogs that we take with us everywhere having a large van (or possible larger SUV) will just make life easier.  We are expecting something $20k-$25k total purchase price.  Our plan would be to drive this vehicle into the ground...but of course we all know how that can go.

Bottom line, I was raised with the idea of NEVER financing a depreciating asset...with a vehicle being the #1 example.  But, if I have the ability to purchase a vehicle in cash without destroying my emergency fund vs. a VERY low interest auto loan which is better?

**Normal stats**:

* annual income = $120k + bonus
* already fully funding Roth IRAs, employer 403B, HSA
* current emergency fund of 3 months income (currently building back to 6 months, had some things occur in 2019 - expected to be back by end of March 2020)
* Student loan debt = \~$40k with 4 years left on loan at 3.375%

&amp;#x200B;

**Example 1**: $25,000 van paid in cash.  Done and done...obviously simpler...

**Example 2**: $25,000 with whatever down payment makes sense (say $10,000).  So $15k auto loan at 1.99% over 48 months (current offering from our local credit union with certain restrictions on vehicle age).  We still have $15,000 and keep in a HYSA or our KASASA checking with 4% interest (NOTE: this is separate from our emergency fund).  My calculation shows that on a $15k loan we would pay $617 in interest, while earning $2,601 at 4% over the same 48 months (NOTE: I am assuming our payments are NOT drawn from this account, but instead our monthly income).

The biggest thing I notice that I am ignoring is depreciation.  But, since we are purchasing used (plan is around 3 years old) the largest amounts of depreciation would have already occurred, plus the depreciation will occur either way loan vs. cash.

It is hard to go against what I have been told over, and over, and over again childhood to now, but I don't see the reason to just give up \~$2,000 over 4 years.  Please either confirm my thinking or show what I am missing.  Thanks all!",No,Yes,No,No,No
flbyr1,poqwrslr,"Using 529 to pay my own Student Loans (SECURE Act)

I have tried to do some research on the SECURE Act and how it could benefit me as I pay off my student loans, but am struggling with a few details.  If someone could explain and also provide resources for reading that would be awesome, so thanks in advance.

My understanding is that with Trump signing the SECURE Act I can now use a 529 plan to pay my monthly student loan payment.  I live in MI, so it is also my understanding that I can deduct up to $10,000 of annual 529 contributions similar to deducting 401K contributions.

But, in reading this article ([https://www.usnews.com/education/best-colleges/paying-for-college/articles/what-to-know-about-paying-student-loans-with-529-plan-funds](https://www.usnews.com/education/best-colleges/paying-for-college/articles/what-to-know-about-paying-student-loans-with-529-plan-funds)) it discusses a lifetime limit of $10,000 to pay off student loans without taxes or penalties:

""The Setting Every Community Up for Retirement Enhancement Act, a spending bill known as the SECURE Act, established a lifetime limit of $10,000 from a 529 plan that can be used without any penalties or tax consequences to repay the beneficiary's student loans, including federal and most private loans.""

So, if I were to contribute $10,000 to a MI 529 plan this year and then use that to pay my student loan payments this year I would max that lifetime limit and the tax benefit of doing this is now nullified moving forward?  Also, can I create a 529 and make myself the beneficiary to even do this?

Again, thanks for any help people can impart.

&amp;#x200B;

ft31ix,poqwrslr,"Invest vs. Pay off home

I'm curious with everything that is going on how this crisis may change people's mind on the idea of investing before paying off a home.  From a mathematical perspective, generally speaking you ""win"" by investing your excess wisely and paying the minimum on your home (assuming you don't over buy and don't end up in foreclosure or something).  But, mathematics get thrown out the window for reality when it comes down to it.

My grandparents grew up in the Great Depression and as a result paid for every home they ever owned in cash 100%.  Of course I do realize the cost of a house was different than now.

My parents have ALWAYS prioritized their investments and paid the minimum on their homes, even including their current.  My father is approximately 2 years from retirement and has around 20 years left on his mortgage.  He admits there is some stress to going into retirement with a mortgage, but he has a military pension that is as guaranteed as it gets (along with his own retirement savings).

My in-laws paid off their home within 3 years of buying (around 1993-94), and have actually lived in that home ever since.  My father-in-law readily admits that financially he knows he ""lost"" in doing so, but also says that the stress relief was worth it and he would do it again and again.

I have always liked the idea of paying some extra toward my home, but felt that should come after my tax advantaged investments (Roth IRA and 401k).  Plus, I still have student loans and feel like those should be prioritized before my mortgage.

With all of this said, I am one of the lucky ones whose income has remained intact during this crisis, and while there is some stress that could change I see it as unlikely (am a PA-C working both ortho and volunteering to help cover UC and ER shifts...so I'm ""useful"").

But, just curious if this historical event will lead some people to change their thought processes somewhat?  Especially when you couple loss of income with significant investment losses.  At our peak we had \~$260k which dropped to  \~$180k.  It's now clawed it's way back to \~$200k, but still sucks to just ""lose"" $60k almost overnight.",Yes,Yes,No,Yes,No
fx5ttv,poqwrslr,"Mortgage deferment vs. forbearance

I'm not sure if this is a good place to post, but if there is a better place please let me know.

Basically, when all of this crap started I had called my mortgage servicer (Freedom Mortgage) to inquire about putting my mortgage on forbearance.  I was told that I could begin forbearance, but after 90 days I would be required to make up those missed payments as a lump sum...essentially requiring me to pay the equivalent of 4 months of payments all at once (3 missed payments + 1 month payment that is normally due).  That's obviously stupid and doesn't help anyone.  It would make significantly more sense to put the payments onto the end of the mortgage - essentially extending the term.

Then I came across this article today &lt;[https://www.npr.org/2020/04/07/828011892/many-struggling-homeowners-not-getting-the-mortgage-relief-u-s-promised](https://www.npr.org/2020/04/07/828011892/many-struggling-homeowners-not-getting-the-mortgage-relief-u-s-promised)\&gt; which calls out Freedom Mortgage for being misleading and creating more hurdles than are required.  I called them today to ask about putting the payments onto the end of the mortgage instead of the lump sum and was told they could not do that, and again the excuse was federal regulations.

Does anyone have any information that can help give clarity on the situation, and assuming Freedom Mortgage is in fact screwing over their customers is there a way to force their hand or at least report their wrong doing (if it is in fact wrong)?

NOTE: I am aware that interest wouldn't stop during the forbearance period, even if the payments are tacked onto the mortgage at the end of the term.  But, that is completely worth it compared to paying $1,200+ monthly when my income has stopped.",Yes,Yes,No,Yes,Yes
knbner,poqwrslr,"Start 529 or no with effect on student loans

I tried to search and struggled to really find a clear answer, so hoping I can at least get some clarity to help with my research.

Basically, we (31M and 32F...married) have a 2.5yo daughter and have been waiting to start her college savings until my student loans were paid off.  We now have the cash to be able to pay off my student loans but have decided that it is worth it to pay less than $2000 in interest over 3.5 years and keep the $32,000 in cash and use in other ways.  As a result of this, we feel ready to start saving for our daughter's future college costs.

My question is whether it will make sense knowing that a 529 impacts financial aid eligibility?  Therefore is there a better way to use this money, possibly a brokerage investment account, pay more on house, backdoor IRA, etc.? (open to suggestions here)

We are already fully funding our HSA, 401k, and Roth IRAs (just the $12k, not doing backdoor right now).  We have zero debt except my student loans and our mortgage.  I currently make approximately $140k, but good chance that prior to our daughter going to college I will decrease how much I work and as a result my income will drop as well (somewhat like a coastFIRE situation).  We also currently have $320k+ in retirement savings.

So, again, does the 529 plan make sense, even though it will decrease financial aid eligibility?  Obviously there are lots of questions about what tuition may look like in the future, but I don't want to count on ""free college.""",Yes,Yes,No,Yes,No
kx5bcc,poqwrslr,"Pay off student loans or hold cash?

**Short version:**

Student loan = \~$31,000 at 3.375%...38 months left with minimum payments, costing a bit less than $1,800 in interest over that time.

Available cash = \~$36,000...

Married: me (31M) and wife (32F, stay-at-home mother) and 2.5yo daughter...currently working with fertility to hopefully continue to grow our family

Pay off the student loans over the next few months, or ""hold"" the cash?

&amp;#x200B;

**Long version:**

I have just over $31,000 in student loans at 3.375% left (only debt other than mortgage), and have essentially $36,000 in available cash.  For quite some time my wife (32F) and I (31M) placed a major focus on paying off my student loans, and have done well bringing the total from $125,000 down to current in 4 years.  But, the pandemic got me worried so we have been hoarding cash for the past year.  (I will add that I would not pay it ALL today, only leaving us with \~$5k in emergency fund.  It would be a process throughout the year.  While the pandemic has not hit us hard financially since my job seems to be pretty secure (healthcare...), it is 100% still ongoing so want a healthy e-fund.)

The wife and I always review our finances at the end of the year, and decided to change gears somewhat by opening and funding a 529 for our 2.5yo daughter in December 2020.  We always had felt that we should pay off my student loans before saving for our daughter's education, but decided to change plans slightly in knowing that we had the cash to pay off my loans.  This was also decided since the student loans ""cost"" such a relatively small amount of interest over the remaining term of the loan.

Basically, the loan has 38 months left with minimum payments of \~$875/mo.  That will cost us a bit under $1,800 in interest over 3+ years.  I will add that the student loans stress me out.  Nothing crazy, but I do pick up pretty significant overtime because technically we don't make our budget on just my base salary.  The calculation puts us $142 short each month, but we don't give as much to our church as I would like to make up the shortcoming.  But, we also never ""fall short"" because I worked \~60 extra shifts last year for an extra \~$25k in income, so it's never really been a problem.

So, does it make sense to hold onto cash (minus the $10k we put into our daughter's 529) and just pay the minimum with such a small interest rate, or get rid of the student loans? (Note: we are already fully funding HSA, IRAs, and my work 401k.)

Bottom line, wife and I made a plan, but now I'm second guessing and strongly considering changing the 529 beneficiary to me and using it to pay down student loans and continuing to do so until they're gone in 2021.  I know this is a personal decision, I'm just hoping to get some good advice..and of course I will discuss this at length with my wife if I do think a change should be made, but generally speaking I handle the finances so she pretty much goes with my recommendations.

(Last thing...there are two upcoming expenses that I guess stress me out.  First...I am planning on purchasing a pellet smoker/grill this spring.  This may cost a bit over $2,000, but am picking up extra shifts in January and February that will more than cover that expense.  Second...as I said we are trying to grow our family.  Based on some info we got yesterday there is a decent chance we will end up with twins.  Which would be super exciting, but also really stresses me out financially.)",No,Yes,No,Yes,Yes
lexlda,poqwrslr,"Zero percent interest worth paying more for vehicle?

So my daily driver has essentially bit the dust.  I won't go into every detail, but basically the car is worthless.  It has rusting on a piece of the frame that requires replacement (verified by a second, independent garage) and that work will cost at least $2000 more than the car is worth.  It's not an immediate issue (per both garages), but the wife and I agreed it doesn't make sense to do the repair.

We had always been planning on either a truck vs. van, but for several reasons the wife and I feel a truck is the way to go.  So, an option that arose was to purchase my father-in-law's truck.  He's been looking to sell and upgrade for a while, so helps everyone involved from that perspective.  The problem is that the truck is worth more than I originally estimated.  Our top number to spend was $25,000, but I really wanted to try to keep it under $20,000.  I think the truck is going to be closer to $30,000.  We have always paid for cars in cash and don't plan to change that.  But, my father-in-law mentioned in passing that he would be fine if we just paid him $250 per month with 0% interest (in-laws are fine financially, this would not hurt their financial security in any way).

This was due to us suffering a stillbirth in 2020 and I forgot to update my withholding since we didn't have an eligible second child and increased income due to working significant overtime (...healthcare during a pandemic...).  So, can anyone provide some good sources to look at whether I should accept these monthly payments or not?  I would prefer not to have a significant tax bill again.

So I've got quite a bit (nearly $30k) set aside for our next car. It's in Ally now, but I could make more on it by moving to VMFXX, in theory.

Will I report that on my taxes for the year I sell (ie, sell in 2023, file on the 2023 taxes in 2024)? How much would that cost in taxes? Is that cost-basis or FIFO?

We have 1 CD at 5% for 11 months, and several at 4.75% for 11 months from Ally with their no penalty option.

I also have about $21k in VMFXX right now. However, I'm debating moving that back into Ally and putting it into a CD as well. However, I could use some other thoughts so I don't keep bouncing money around for minor shifts.

1. We haven't had it there long enough to even earn interest yet. What happens if I move it back before 30 days? Do I lose the interest or does Vanguard just put that interest into the fund?

2. Does it make more sense to spread out amongst all the banks or better to move back to Ally, but put it into the CD?

3. Look into other options? 

This is money that is our EF ($10k) and next car fund ($11k). So not needed right now, but at least half will likely be needed in the next year or two. I also like having a good amount of cash that is easy to access, but in a real emergency, we will pull whatever we need to.

Many people struggle trying to decide whether to do a traditional IRA or a Roth IRA. My suggestion is to wait until you are ready to file taxes and calculate how much you'll owe with each option. Then put the money in the account that results in less taxes paid. If you start the tax filing early enough, this works fairly well if you've saved the cash throughout the year in a HYSA and can put in all in at once. 

Important to note, this should only be done if your income varies throughout the year (due to job change, significant income change, new baby, etc).

11v9bp8,QandGone,"how do i go about my FSA in my situation?

I was planning on having (still am planning on it probably) a diagnostic colonoscopy. because its for diagnostic purposes, i am doubting it will be covered by my insurance. so to plan for that, i opted to choose for the FSA plan this year at my job. and in turn, put in $1800 to the FSA.

i get paid every 2 weeks, and the 1800 is divided into it by 26 paychecks. so every 2 weeks, my paycheck adds ~~$70 to my FSA each year.

however, i am planning on moving jobs. but i know my FSA/health insurance acc will show up as $1800 available, meaning i dont necessarily have to wait until the money is actually in the FSA before using it. but can use $1800 still.

but in my case, since ill be moving jobs, what exactly happens here?

1. the money thats already in the FSA account up to YTD. i think its been 5? paychecks so far? so about $200 in my FSA acc.

2. if i was to claim the full $1800 and move jobs

3. the current plan thats contributing ~~$70 per paycheck.

13f06h6,QandGone,"Can someone help me understand how Health Insurance works and how to make sure I dont get screwed? (USA)

I am in the USA. I understand the fundamentals of health insurances. such as deductibles, copay, max OOP, etc.

Also that some procedures (Usually preventative ones) are  sometimes 100% covered by health insurance even before deductibles are met. (sometimes might have a small copay,)

and that once you meet your deductible, you pay coinsurance % only and insurance covers the rest. once you hit max OOP, you no longer pay for anything and health insurance covers it all.

in general, this also applies when you use out of network providers as well, its just the values it covers are usually higher (i.e. higher copay, or coinsurance, etc) but once you meet your max OOP, health insurance will cover out of network providers as well (i believe?)

but i keep reading horror stories of it being much more complicated than that on /r/pf.

the reason why i ask this is because i have a colonoscopy coming up. it is not preventative, but will be diagnostics. so i fully expect it to have to pay myself. but im assuming it will go towards my deductible.

in addition, i will be getting anesthesia. so i want to make sure that falls under my insurance and is either covered fully, or i dont end up paying thousands for it because the anesthesia specific individual that comes, or even the whole company that provides the anesthesia service for my doctors clinic, is an out of network provider.

i also am worried because i would like to get a endoscopy at the same time. meaning I want to ensure this falls under my insurance. my deductible is only $2k. and max OOP i believe was like $2.5k. 

so i would assume max i would have to pay for all this is $2.5k. but i want to make sure something weird doesnt happen here.",Yes,Yes,No,No,Yes

So for once, this is a story regarding my medical bill being much lower than I thought it would be.

This year, i knew i would need to get a colonoscopy (which i got one). doing my research, this would fall under diagnostic purposes. and in fact, there was a polyp also found and removed.

so for sure this is is not preventative, but diagnostics. Which insurance does not cover.

Doing my research, i found that a colonoscopy is in the $1.5k to $1.8k range. However, I got my bill from the clinic. and it went from $1400 to about $500 (all including everything i believe. including anesthesia i think?...). Insurance covered about $1k.

if i am correct, my deductible is $300 and out of pocket max is $2.5k.

Im afraid to ask questions on what happened here, or ask for a EOB as well as an itemized bill.

q3eq8f,QuitLeagueofLeg,"Should I get an HSA/ high deductible plan if I need surgery soon?

Hi

My employer does not have a 401k since we are a start up in tech.  While the salary and stock benefit is nice, I don't really have any retirement accounts except for roughly $12k in a Roth IRA from my past job.  

So should I choose a high deductible plan to get the HSA for retirement purposes?  I've been reading up on the account and the benefits but I know I will likely need surgery within 12 months.  I had an annual physical with my doctor and she said I may need surgery to fix a cosmetic deformity on my foot.

q7o3vk,QuitLeagueofLeg,"Invest my IRA in Stock since I have no 401k, pension, or profit sharing plan?

Hi,

I don't have a 401k at my new job and I plan to stay here at my employer for a while.  I am going to create a IRA since my income phases me out from creating a ROTH ira.

Since I'm limited to only contributing a mere $6,000 to my retirement each year,  I was considering purchasing stock in companies that I understand pretty well give my work experience.  This does not violate any policies at my employer.

My rationale is I want to try to get the highest return ideally (while I'm young) rather than just choosing a target date fund with bonds and international stocks since I'm limited to a $6k contribution each year.  Later in life, I can just switch to a target date fund when I'm older.    I think I may create an HSA as well but that is only an additional $3k and the purpose of the funds would be restricted to certain uses.

Your thoughts?  Is this not a good idea and I'm better off just sticking to a target date fund even when I'm still in my 20s?  Would I be better off just sticking to an index fund and then maybe making a side bet here and there with just 5-10% of my portfolio?   I would plan to stick to this strategy for maybe 10-20 years and then switch to a TDF.  Either that or I change employers and then they will have a 401k or some sort of profit sharing plan or pension that I can receive.

&amp;#x200B;

It's kinda silly that I'm limited to just $6,000 since my employer doesn't have a 401k.  What happens later in life when my income goes up significantly?  How do I adequately save if these tax deferred or tax free accounts are so restricted.  Am I just going to put all my money in a taxable brokerage account?

Hey everyone,

I am finally close to paying off my student loans and have a positive net worth. I ended my lease and am living with my parents for a bit until I have to move back to the City once this Covid stuff is over with.  

My next goal is to max retirement contributions, emergency fund, and mostly save for a 20% down payment for a house in my high cost of living area.

  
**My Question is how do you reconcile going on trips overseas vs. saving.**   Should I just not travel until I reach my saving goals?  Try to save for a down payment for 3 years then go traveI?  Don't go overseas and just travel nearby domestically for 1/3rd the price?  Or just go anyways and enjoy life.

I'm getting enticed by these higher end credit cards and already signed up for American Express Gold Card and may get a hotel card shortly (I travel maybe 3-4 times per year for work and family).  I'm looking at the trips I want to go on to Europe or Asia and it'll probably cost me $2000 approximately for a week or maybe less with the point redemptions from the SUB for the Gold card and hotel card.

I just refinanced my mortgage to a 15-year fixed rate conventional at 2.625% (2.723% APR).  I've seen comments that state you shouldn't pay a cent over your monthly payment in today's climate since mortgage interest rates are well below what you could expect to earn by investing the money over the life of the loan.

For example, if I assume a 6% annual return on an S&amp;P 500 index fund, it's obviously way higher than the 2.625% interest rate on my mortgage.  But the total interest percentage (TIP) on my mortgage is 21.242%.  What rates should I be comparing when making this decision.

pulbtz,Rainpia,"HSA Loophole Question

My understanding of the ""loophole"": 

If you have an HSA eligible medical expense that you can afford to pay out of pocket, pay it out of pocket and save the receipts. An HSA doesn't care when you withdraw for the eligible expense, so this lets your HSA funds stay invested longer for more potential growth. This will allow your HSA to grow to fund higher medical expenses down the road which are more likely to occur with older age.

Question:

* Why do you need to save your receipts now? Won't you be able to withdraw against the higher medical expense itself when it occurs down the road? Why would you need more than that big medical bill when it occurs?
* Or is the loophole meant to let you withdraw for non-medical related expenses using saved HSA eligible receipts? This is the only logic I can think of for this method, but if I'm counting my HSA as a part of my retirement, I wouldn't want to touch it for non-medical related expenses prior to retirement anyway, right?",Yes,Yes,No,No,No

This is something new I learned today and I wanted to check with you guys to see if my understanding is correct and I'm taking the right steps to take advantage of a 529 plan. TIA!

Under the SECURE act, student loans have been added as a qualified expense that can be paid for by 529 plans as of 2019. There is a lifetime limit of $10,000 from a 529 plan that can be used without any penalties or tax consequences to repay the beneficiary's student loans, including federal and most private loans.The Virginia529 (VA is the state my spouse and I currently reside) allows state residents to deduct annual contributions up to a limit of $4,000 for taxpayers filing married/jointly.

With the current COVID-19 forbearance, we've been saving to make a bulk payment towards my wife's federal student loan debt once forbearance ends in Jan. Based on the info above, are there any issues with the following plan to take advantage of a 529?

1. Open a Virginia529 with wife as beneficiary in Dec 2021 and contribute $4,000.
2. Contribute an additional $4,000 in Jan 2022.
3. Towards the end of Jan (before forbearance ends) pay off highest interest student loans by withdrawing $8,000 from Virginia529 and using any remaining savings reserved for student loans.
4. Make regular payments in 2022.
5. Contribute additional $2,000 to 529 in Jan 2023 and withdraw to make an additional $2,000 payment in 2023 to complete $10,000 lifetime limit.

This would effectively allow me to take the maximum annual 529 state tax deductions in 2021, 2022, and 2023. We've been saving to make a bulk student loan payment anyway, might as well route $10,000 of it through a 529 to take advance of the state tax deductions right?

Also, one caveat to this is that plan holders cannot claim any student loan interest deductions paid with a 529. Earlier this month, I also paid exactly $2,500 in student loan interest to get the max annual deduction for interest paid on student loans in 2021. My plan above wouldn't impact this because that payment was not through 529, correct?",Yes,Yes,No,Yes,No

tjl8sq,Rainpia,"'US 10-Year Treasury Note Yield' vs 'Prime Rate' as a benchmark for debt repayment/investing order

I have no financial background, I'm just trying to understand different concepts I've seen to help decide debt repayment and investing order/priorities. I've seen both the 'US 10-Year Treasury Note Yield' and the 'Prime Rate' used to determine whether interest on a debt is considered high/moderate/low. For example:

**Current US 10-Year Treasury Note Yield as of today is 2.302%:**

1. High interest debt is 5% or more above the current yield, so anything above 7.302%
2. Moderate interest debt is 3% or more above the current yield, so anything above 5.302% but less than 7.302%
3. Low interest debt is less than 3% above the current yield, so anything below 5.302%

\-or-

**Current Prime Rate as of today is 3.50%:**

1. High interest debt is double the prime rate and above, so anything above 7.00%
2. Moderate interest debt is above the prime rate, so anything above 3.50% but less than 7.00%
3. Low interest debt is less than the prime rate, so anything below 3.50%

There are similarities to these concepts, but as you can see, it starts to differ as we get into the identification of moderate and low interest debt. Does using one benchmark over the other make more sense from a financial perspective? Would love to hear your thoughts.

* You and your spouse can buy $10,000 in I Bonds for yourselves this year, so $20,000 total.
* You can your spouse can also buy another $10,000 in I Bonds as gifts for each other. But you have to hold it for a year before you deliver to each others TD account. So another $20,000 for $40,000 total this year.
* However, when you deliver the gifts to each other next year, you've met the $10,000 purchase limit for that year so you can no longer buy yourselves I Bonds.

On nearly every investment board on the Internet are tons of people who swear that they have the perfect plan for a guaranteed funded retirement.  Here is their foolproof plan:

**They live on the stock dividends and don't touch the principal.**

Is this genius or just ill-informed?  I vote ill-informed because if you spend the dividends paid by the stock investments you are in fact spending the principal.  People assume that stock dividends are like bank interest where you are getting extra money every month/quarter above and beyond the value of your portfolio.  This is wrong!  Stock dividends are not like getting bank account interest.

**When a dividend is paid, the cash paid to each shareholder is deducted from the cash held by the company. This reduces the book value of the company when it pays you a dividend. Therefore, the value of the company is reduced every time it pays a dividend. In addition, when a dividend is paid, the stock price of the company is automatically adjusted by the stock market by the amount of the dividend. Therefore, in our example, if the company pays a $1.00/share dividend, then the stock price would automatically adjust from $100/share to $99/share after the dividend is paid. The same would drop would occur in the book value of the company.** 

So when you withdraw the dividend payment from your account and spend it, the value of your portfolio is down the same as if you did a scheduled withdrawal of the same percentage as the dividend payment.

A friend of mine- who retired early at age 60- is well off and does not really need the money from Social Security.  So he plans to apply for SS and invest each monthly check in the stock and bond market and give the proceeds to his children at his death.  The question is should he start collecting at age 62 or wait till 70 and get the largest monthly check.

For the sake of argument, he said he plans to live to age 90.  (just a guess of course but a common age for someone who is healthy and privileged.)  So if he collected Social Security at age 62 he would collect 336 smaller monthly checks for 28 years.  If he waited until 70 to collect SS he would collect 240 larger monthly checks for 20 years.

I found this is a fascinating math and investing question.  So I did some calculations from the historical stock market records.  I used both a total stock market fund and a balanced mutual fund (Vanguard Wellington (VWELX) that has been in operation since the 1930s.

I assumed the ""collect at age 62 monthly check"" to be $2000 a month and a collect starting at age 70 check of $4000.00.  Each would increase each year for inflation.

I ask them why they don't just do it themselves and choose a 60-40 Balanced Mutual Fund or Target Date Fund and put a percentage of their income in each month.  They told me their Financial Planner promises them a much higher return with much less risk than using a simple Balanced or Target Mutual Fund.

I asked them for the list of stocks, ETF's and Mutual Funds they are invested in on the recommendation of their Financial Planner and I would do an investigation on how these investments have done in the past vs my favorite Balanced Mutual Funds.

I believe that for the majority of America 2021 has been a great year financially. Maybe the best ever.

Sure there are signs of trouble. People are struggling with inflation, some people lost their jobs and businesses due to COVID, and the people who live paycheck to paycheck are still struggling, just like they always have and will be in the future.

But for most folks 2021 has been a great year financially.

Wages are way up for the bottom third of the population. Many people who just a couple of years ago were making $8.00 an hour are now making $15 an hour plus.

If you have a trade, a college education, or any type of work skill, employers want you and will pay you good money to work and stay at their company. The job market is great.

The government helped everyone with deferred student loans, aid checks, and deferrals on paying rent and mortgages.

$179,000 base,

$29,535 target bonus (if I get the standard rating or above, which 95%+ of people get)

$80,000 equity (RSU)

My WLB is excellent, I hardly put in more than 40 hours a week on average. I sometimes work late nights but that's not the norm. I am able to go do hobby stuff at any time during the day without meetings, because I know I can just make up that work later. I have a great manager and team, and the benefits are really good.

However, I recently got an offer at a unicorn, about to IPO soon (according to recruiter). The compensation is MUCH higher, around $415,000:

$170,000 base

$20,400 target bonus

$225,000 equity (RSU)

The problem is that the equity is paper money, and I can't sell it until IPO or liquidation. Furthermore, it's based on current valuation, which could change drastically (for the better or worse) when it IPOs. Also, I heard the WLB at this current company is not great (team dependent), I have a 1 year cliff on getting the equity, and the cash compensation is lower.

I asked a question about RSU's last week and you all were so very helpful! Thanks for that.

I have an apartment with my college friends in Berkeley where 4 of us share a nice 2 bedroom apartment, each paying around $1,200, which I think is a lot more reasonable. However, it's about a 1.5 hour one way commute from Berkeley to work (fortunately, we have transportation shuttles), so I'm not sure the 1K a month savings is worth that much trouble?
2. Investing: After saving for retirement, HSA, etc, I'm wondering how much should I put into the stock market? What is a good percentage of the money left over? I've done options trading in the past, but I kind of want to just have money passively grow in the stock market.
3. Other savings: I'm not sure how much is a reasonable spend per month; should I aim to save everything after fixed expenses? Is there any reason why I should open a savings account over putting money into the stock market?
4. Monthly income: I'm normalizing my salary by 12 months, though in reality, I get less per month but a few times a year (RSU vesting and bonus time), I can expect a fair bit more. Is this a reasonable way to think about monthly income?
5. Other than health insurance, are things like dental, life, etc useful?
6. Debt: I have around 13K in subsidized federal student loans, but my company is matching my annual payment up to a certain amount, and people on my previous post mentioned that I should try to get it from 7% to a lower percentage. I think I can do that. However, I also owe my parents around 80K for 1.5 years of school (I am from out of state). How should I pay that without paying tax? I heard anything over 10K is taxable?

I know that the Roth IRA income cap is $139,000. My base salary is 131,000 but i also get like 40-50K in stocks and target bonus is 20K (my sign on and relo also added up to around 30K), so although my salary is 131,000, the total amount of money Iâ€™m earning is over 139,000.

mwi5vx,RatinSweet,"2 questions about retirement accounts

**HSA**

My HSA allows me to invest money as long as I have $500 in the account. My insurance deductible is $1,800 and maximum out of pocket is $2,400 (I assume this means that the most I will ever pay for hospital expenses, whether it's surgery, amputation, whatever is $2,400 right). My thinking is that I should have $2,400 liquid cash perpetually and the rest goes invested. Is this a good idea?

**IRA**

I don't qualify for Roth IRA due to income so I'll have to do backdoor -- I read that for backdoor, I can't withdraw any principle until my account is 5 years old. If that's the case, I am really struggling to convince myself that an IRA is a good idea mainly since it's money I can't/shouldn't touch for 39 years lol. I already max out my 401K and my employer match is $9,500. I would rather have flexibility in how I spend and use my money over a 20% long term capital gains savings.

Now, the annual maximum for 401K contributions (pre and post tax) for me is like 56K or something. I don't plan or want to save 56K into retirement (I'm 20, wanna have some fun), but I do want to save 6K into an IRA. I have to back door it, which is a pretty big pain right, so is there any disadvantage to going through with a 6K post tax contribution to my 401K, of which is automatically converts to Roth, vs using an IRA?

On my paystub, I have my gross income (year to date), FIT Taxable wages (year to date), taxes,  deductions, and then net. I'm not going to itemize, so taking the standard deduction, is it reasonable to assume that 15K will be returning to me come tax time? Or is the FIT taxable wages already deducting from the standard deduction. I don't think that's the case, since my FIT taxable wages + deductions = gross pay. Shouldn't it be FIT Taxable wages + 15K standard deduction + deductions (401K, hsa, etc) = gross pay?

Is it just that when it comes to paystubs, they aren't taking into account the standard deduction? In which case, I can expect 15K to come back next year?

Another question: my bonus was counted as another paycheck pretty much, and I'm not entirely sure if my RSUs are taxed upfront. I might have to pay taxes on my RSUs later since my company shares are around 2K, and I don't think the broker does fractional shares.

I still see tremendous growth potential in this company for the upcoming 5-10 years. I was debating maxing out with VOO but this year I really want to go all out with Apple. They have pretty much the same returns as VOO for the year. Voo pays a higher dividend and obviously is less risky. What should I do?

qg5gdk,rayfusion7,"Need Advice on House Purchase and Retirement Planning

 Hi all, writing on behave of my parents. They have a core principle of staying away from debt and not owing anything to anyone. So because of them I've graduated college debt free, and I'm their only son. They are about 12-15 years away from retirement. The issue is that my parents are still renting. Not gonna lie, its a pretty big apartment for the price that we are paying a month, this is because of the sheer amount of time that we've been renting. For context we live in a HCOL area in the Northeast (By NYC). But I think they are ready to move on and finally get a house. They have a huge down payment as they are naturally great savers, around 25%. The issue is that they can fit the mortgage payments into 40% of their take home pay on a 15 year fixed. It'll be around 40% of their take home pay. Is it okay to pay 40% of your take home pay towards a mortgage especially if you, have no debt, are already maxing out your Roth and 401K match contribution, and don't have to worry about college as well. They think that if all they do from now until retirement is pay off the mortgage ad continue to invest in their retirement, they'll have around a million in retirement and a paid for house, within 10-15 years. Also my thinking was that I'd also would like to help them with the mortgage, as I would be living with them for the foreseeable future, and basically pay them 'rent' in a sense, as they drastically helped me with college. Another option would be to  get a 30 year fixed and they'll pay the monthly amount and contribute my amount towards their principal. That way they have a bit more money to contribute towards retirement. Any thoughts?",Yes,Yes,No,Yes,No

jchyrq,riccarjo,"My life fell apart and I moved home with my parents, allowing me to save up a year's worth of rent. Now I want to make sure I'm making the smartest financial choices, what should I do?

About a year and a half ago I left my fiancee after a 7 year relationship.  Due to this, I had to move back home with my parents, but all of the sudden I had much lower living expenses with the same salary.  I ended up saving about $20k over the year and want to ultimately have enough to own a house in a few years.  

Since I hit $20k, however, I signed a lease to a house with a few friends of mine.  I don't have the greatest relationship with my parents and the house is *huge* and cheap.  So while moving out may not have been the best financial decision, it was the healthiest one for me.  I also had absolutely no furniture or things of my own moving in, so I had to spend a chunk to buy all of that as well.

Some caveats: 

1. I am severely underpaid at work and currently looking to get a new job.  I know that's the most efficient way of increasing my financial stability/savings.  Just hasn't happened yet. (Most jobs I'm interviewing for are offering 30-50% salary increases)
2. I know I can put everything I own into my student loans, but I like having liquid cash to fall on in case things fall apart again.  Plus, I really do want a house and I feel like putting everything into my student loans would push that back a few years if not more. I could be wrong.

So here's what my financial make up looks like right now:

Cash: $14,500 (Deposit, realtor fee, first month's rent, furniture, etc. cost about $5,500 total).

403b: $9,100 (No company match.  I contribute $250 a month to this)

Salary: $62,000 (I know this is low, but I'm actively working to find a new job.  I work in a nonprofit)

Student loans: $64,000 at 3.7% interest rate, I pay $650 a month towards this.  I originally had a loan with rates over 11%, refinanced it to 6% and then refinanced again to 3.7%

Car: I bought a used 2018 chevy cruze for $14,000. I financed $9k and paid $5k up front.  I pay $213 a month and will pay it off 3.5 years now.  I tried to find something cheaper, but anything cheaper required a ton of work, and leasing just feels like a waste of money.  I'm happy with this purchase.4

Credit rating: 765

&amp;#x200B;

I'm comfortable for now, my budget is conservative but just due to my low salary I can only afford to cash away $300-500 a month right now and still remain relatively comfortable.  I'm hoping to be able to get back to $20k by the end of the year.  However, should I invest this cash into a Vanguard?  I'm just very worried about losing this as a large emergency fund for myself.

To spare the details, I am 28 and have been having some digestive issues for the past 5-6 years.

I'm assuming GERD, but I also have some health anxiety so I wanted to get it checked out.

My GI wants me to get an endoscopy and colonoscopy.  The problem is that my insurance's deductible is $3,000 and they only pay 60% after that with a maximum out of pocket of $8,150.  Considering an endoscopy alone can be $5-6,000, it looks like I'm going to have to pay a ton of money for this.

I have a rudimentary understanding of real estate and having financial assets, but no matter what way I look at this, I can't help but feel my landlord made a mistake.  The reason I'm wondering is because we would like to renew our lease, but are trying to get ahead of any rent raises.  We live in NYC, so it's quite possible.

The way I understand it is that our landlord is in his mid/late 30s and recently bought a condo.  They lived in the condo for a few years and we're the first people they're renting it out to.  I looked on a few websites and got an estimate of what the actual property is worth, and it seems almost certain that any type of mortgage worth it's salt would be what we pay, if not much more.

Say we were to hypothetically pay $1,000 in rent, each mortgage calculator I look at gives figures of $950 - $1,400 a month for the property.  Most other listings in the area go for $1,200 - $1,400 in rent.  Again, all hypothetical numbers, but the ratios are roughly accurate.

Why would our landlord do this?

1. Could it just be that they didn't know the market value?  Since they had a realtor I doubt this is the case.
2. Could they have had a hard time finding an applicant? From what I can see the listing was only up for a few days before we applied
3. They don't really want to profit off of the property and just want to keep it occupied while they live outside the city?  If so, that still doesn't explain why they wouldn't try to at least make SOME profit off of it

uqao9a,riccarjo,"My parents are reaching a critical point in their finances and I don't know how to help them.

My parents have always struggled financially.  My dad was very conservative and wanted my mom to be a stay-at-home mom.  They ended up having 4 kids, which was more than they expected, and my dad did not make enough to support such a large family.  So my mom went back to school and ended up working a teaching job.  Then my dad got laid off from work during 2008 and didn't really get another full time job until 2017 or so.  Even then, it's a low paying hourly job. Combined, they make probably $70k before taxes.  


My dad has pretty severe OCD and anxiety, and has also had a number of health issues - so it's becoming increasingly apparent he won't be able to keep his job, and my mom is going to turn 70 this year.  

Some massive red flags for them:

1. Zero retirement savings.  They cashed all their investments in after 2008 when my dad was out of a job
2. They refinanced the house just a few years ago and restarted their 30 year mortgage.  So they'll definitely be paying it off for the rest of their lives.  The mortgage is also definitely underwater as the house is falling apart.  The only real asset is that it's a large property in a pretty expensive suburb.
3. Since the house is falling apart, they are going to have a hard time selling it (at least that's their excuse for not wanting to sell it).  They also have an oil tank in the front yard which I believe is a very costly expense for any new homeowners.  So it'll have to get taken care of before it gets sold, I guess?
4. They pay over $10k in property taxes a year (Mortgage is $1.2k, taxes are $800 a month or so)
5. My dad owes a shit ton for medical issues, so I believe they're just paying minimums on their medical debt for the rest of their lives.  I don't know how much it is.
6. They used to have significant credit card debt, but they somehow were able to fix this a few years back without declaring bankruptcy.  I think they combined all their cards into one account and were able to get a decent payment on that.  But I'm not sure.

&amp;#x200B;

Been seeing everyone talk about High Yield Savings Accounts (HYSAs) lately, so I checked my account info and see I'm earning 0.1% in my Capital One checking and 0.3% in my Capital One savings.  I browsed their products to find they offer two savings accounts, a ""360 Performance Savings"" with a 0.4% APY and a ""Kids Savings Account"" with a 0.3% APY.  I guess things changed with them in the past few years and they have new products.  Looking at their CDs, 60 months is the same APY as their 360 Performance Savings account.

Why would anyone ever choose a CD with a period of 60 months or less if one can get the same APY out of their savings account (which has no minimums or fees, by the way).  I guess the only benefit would be they wouldn't be tempted to draw from it (savings account vs. CD).

Sounds like a short term move for me would be to open a 360 Performance Savings account and transfer all my savings funds from my current account to that one for the extra 0.1% APY.  Are there any other savings accounts I should be looking at instead for better APYs?

nnr733,riptol337,"Budget / Tracking Spreadsheet Help

I've used Mint in the past to help categorize my spending but soon stopped bothering with it because I believe it didn't matter to track my spending.

I've always been frugal, and saving has been a priority. I started with a financial advisor a few years back and didn't really have a plan, besides to save, eventually buy a house, and retire around 55ish.

I'm trying to take more control, break away from my advisor, and iron down my numbers better but I'm having a hard time understanding what I really should be doing. I've seen so many budget spreadsheets that seem complex and overkill.

I've attached (hopefully) a picture of what I've come up with so far. Basically I enter all my purchases from receipts (or transfer numbers from credit cards), categorize them, and do a monthly average between today and the first of the year. (this sheet starts at 8/1 because that's when I moved to my current place but I plan to just have one sheet going forward). I also have set costs that I know about for expected monthly expenses (rent, internet, etc.).

The parts I'm stuck on are:

What is really the purpose of a budget spreadsheet? What I'm doing is all reactivate; I'm calculating monthly average based on past purchases.

I also don't know how to incorporate my income and 401k and HSA contributions.

How can I use this better to tell me if I'll have enough money to retire early?

Could anyone shed some light on any suggestions or recommended spreadsheets that may be better?

ns1qk5,riptol337,"Paying off Car Loan

Hello all. I owe about $10k left on my 5 year car loan. Payment is $550, and I always pay $600, so figure around another 1.5 years to pay it off.

My loan is at 2.29%. I believe when signing papers for the loan, the expected interest amount was around $1800.

Iâ€™m not hurting for cash, I have it, and could pay it off today, but Iâ€™ve always understood debt to come down to, if I could put that cash somewhere else and make more than the loan APY (right term?), then keep the debt.

My options are something like VTI in the markets, or my 3% HMBradley account.

Hello. Posted this in r/firsttimehomebuyer but I believe this would be a great community for thoughts as well.

I moved away from home in 2010 to CT with a roommate. We lived together since August 2020 where we had short notice (30 days) to find a new place. I had been long done having a roommate so buying had always been in the back of my mind, but hard to do considering my monthly living expenses were only around $800/month. When I was notified about having to move, I didn't want to rush into anything as a first time buyer in 30 days.

I got lucky and am living in a co-workers' parents' basement apartment for $400/month.  I only pay for internet ($40/month) on top of that $400. I'm about half the distance to work from where I was living.

Expenses being so low, should I focus on saving cash, maxing out 401k via mega backdoor?

I would like to eventually get my own place, but this market is rough for buyers. But they are also 80 years old and who knows when something could happen and I have to leave.

The cash and estimated growth was recharacterized into a brand new Traditional IRA (~$7400).  I contributed $2000 in 2021 to my Roth IRA at the beginning of this year.  At this point I left my financial advisor.  Since then, I've not done anything with either account except transfer them both to Fidelity for me to manage them myself.

My goal is to have all my IRA money in Roth, so if I'm understanding the process correctly, I'll need to recharacterize my 2021 contribution of $2000 to Traditional, and then convert my total Traditional IRA balance (~$9400) to Roth.

1. Can I convert over the contribution limit of $6000?

There is a possibility I cross over into the 32% federal income tax bracket this year, depending how overtime goes the rest of the year.

All my IRA and 401k contributions have been Roth up to this point in my life (34 years old). I am wondering if it may be wise to monitor my income as we get closer to the end of the year and switch my 401k contributions from Roth to pre-tax to keep my income below the $170k threshold of the 32% bracket.

166quyc,roleparadise,"Federal Student Loans: best approach as interest and payments start back up... Should I wait another year before I start paying?

I have a few thousand dollars left in federal student loans. I would probably just pay them off if it weren't for the Biden administration's continued efforts to forgive them.

That said, the administration has announced some new programs for paying back these loans--one that's intriguing me is this (quoting New York Times):

>If you can make an on-time payment, you absolutely should. But if you miss a bill or two, you wonâ€™t be penalized â€” at least not for the first year after repayment begins.  
The Biden administration has provided a yearlong â€œon-rampâ€ to help ease borrowers back into the repayment routine. So if you miss a monthly payment from Oct. 1 to Sept. 30, 2024, you wonâ€™t be considered delinquent. You also wonâ€™t be reported to the credit bureaus, placed in default or reported to debt collection agencies.

I'm wondering if it would be a good strategy to avoid payments for another year with the hope that the balance will be maximally forgiven.

An obvious downside would be extra interest accrued, which is about 4-5%, but that's about the same rate as my high interest savings account, where the money would sit if not paying those monthly payments. So unless I'm misunderstanding the math, it's not hurting me either way.

He even made a mistake once, which had to be corrected. We unfortunately had to make a homeowner's claim a couple years ago, and the process sucked. We got assigned a claim specialist who was completely independent from my agent, and they were terrible. It was a painful experience.

A Roth IRA is all after-tax. You contribute with after-tax dollars, so your growth and eventual withdrawals are not taxed again. But once you reach a certain income threshold, you can't contribute to a Roth IRA anymore. You can make contributions to a Traditional IRA, but you may not be able to deduct them on your income taxes. 

Thus, they become ""non-deductible contributions"", and you are supposed to file Form 8606 to inform the IRS so that they aren't taxed a second time upon withdrawal.

So how is this different from a Roth IRA? In both cases, aren't you contributing with after-tax money and letting it grow, and then not getting taxed again?",No,Yes,No,No,No

I work for a small company that uses a 3rd party HR platform. I log into this website to update payroll information, elect benefits, time off, etc. Last week, we received an email that we're going to be switching over to a different provider and to look out for that information. That raised a flag to me, because our benefits package was branded by with our previous platform's name (the HR platform was on my health insurance ID card, not my actual company).

My HR person confirmed yesterday that yes, we will be switching benefits effective April 1. I don't know how common that sort of thing is, but that sounds crazy to me. We have ongoing medical care which I suppose is at-risk for no longer being covered or in-network on the new plan? (We haven't received any actual info on that yet) Not to mention the money we've spent towards out of pocket maximums so far in 2023.

11svldn,rvH3Ah8zFtRX,"""Rollover IRA"" vs ""Traditional IRA""

When I left my last company, I rolled my 401k into a Traditional IRA in Vanguard. During that process, Vanguard created a ""Rollover IRA"" for me. Is this a different type of account than a regular Traditional IRA? I didn't think so (and assumed the ""Rollover"" tag was just the account name to help me differentiate), but then I found [this article](https://www.sofi.com/learn/content/rollover-ira-vs-traditional-ira/) which mentions how they're different. So maybe they are separate types of accounts?

The reason I ask is because I'm clearing out the Rollover IRA so that I can do a Backdoor Roth. Once the account is back at $0, should I close that and open a regular Traditional IRA? Or can I just keep using the ""Rollover"" one (even though it will no longer have rolled-over funds in it)?",No,No,No,No,No
124r8zn,rvH3Ah8zFtRX,"Should we consider dropping my employer-sponsored insurance to get coverage for a specific procedure?

My wife and I are in the beginning stages of researching IVF. Basically all we know right now is that it can be very expensive, on the order of $10k per cycle. The good news is that we live in a state (Illinois) which requires that health insurance plans cover it. The bad news is that it's chock full of loopholes. Apparently there's an exception for ""self insured"" plans (which many large companies do). And also doesn't apply to companies with out of state headquarters (which mine is). And I've also heard that even using a plan administrator based outside of IL can remove the requirement. 

So long story short, our plan wouldn't cover it. We currently pay about $325 per month (pre tax) for our coverage. I did a bit of window shopping on healthcare.gov, and found plans that *do* cover it for around $850 per month (not sure if that would be pre- or post-tax). Some back of the napkin math shows that would be about $7k extra in premiums over 12 months, to possibly save $10k+.

Yeah, it's illegal to base any decisions on her being pregnant, but not illegal to include a pregnant person in layoffs. On the one hand, if her company sees laying off a pregnant woman as risky, that might make her sort of untouchable. On the other hand, if they know she's going to be out for a couple months on leave, maybe that tips her into being included in the layoff group (which would probably be difficult or impossible to prove it was done for those reasons).

My wife has been at her job for about a year, and quietly received word that she is likely to be included in the next round of layoffs, probably in the next couple weeks. She had a pretty good 401k match that we've been taking advantage of, but the vesting schedule is 0% until 2 years of service, at which point it's 100%. So at ~1 year, she's slated to forfeit it all.

The employee handbook has some guidelines around layoff severance, but 401k vesting isn't mentioned. The plan documents don't mention this scenario either. Nor does there seem to be any laws requiring that an employer's contributions become vested in the event of involuntary layoffs. (The closest thing I could find is the ""partial plan termination"" scenario, where if 20% of the workforce is laid off, apparently everyone else becomes fully vested. Honestly, I'm not sure how realistic that scenario is, as it's a major corporation that likely hasn't reached the 20% threshold.)

I've also seen mention of trying to negotiate a severance package. I guess there wouldn't be much to lose by trying, but I'm not optimistic they'd agree since we wouldn't be negotiating from a position of strength. Are there any other angles to pursue with this?

Last week my wife awoke with severe abdominal pain and we quickly headed to the Emergency Room. The pain was so severe we debated calling an ambulance, this wasn't a case of using the ER for a minor issue. While there, the doctors did several types of imaging. One of them was a CT scan.

While at the hospital, I paid our ER copay of a couple hundred dollars. The claims have just posted to our account, and one type of imaging was fully covered by our insurance. However, the CT scan was not. The claims summary shows ""No prior authorization"" and an ""Insurance pays"" amount of $0.00 and the full balance listed under ""Your Share"".

Doing some googling, I see that it is common for CT scans to require prior authorization by insurance, which usually takes 5 to 10 days. Obviously we didn't have the luxury of time, so apparently that means we are stuck paying the full cost out of pocket? It doesn't even appear that it was subject to our plan's coinsurance of 10%. 

(Edit: apparently coinsurance would only apply after the deductible is met, which we are still below. Grr this is all so confusing.)

The strong personalities have largely moved on, and I now know how and where to push back to avoid a repeat of last time.

Given my relative position of strength, I'm wondering if there's anything I can/should negotiate for my return. For example, I had accrued stock options which I did not exercise so I lost them.

17fg7mw,rvH3Ah8zFtRX,"Making sense of term life insurance length and benefit amount

My wife and I are expecting a baby and so we're starting to shop for term life insurance. And so of course we need to determine the proper term and benefit amount. We're early/mid 30s, in good health, and make a combined $280k (split nearly 50/50) with annual bonuses up to 15% (not guaranteed, but some portion of that is likely). I've read different article and suggestions, and it seems like it can get very complicated very quickly, with many philosophies / opinions on how to do it.

For the term, I've seen that you should cover up to your retirement age, or just until the age ""where income replacement is necessary"". Are these not the same thing? For me, that would be approximately a 30 year term, but it seems like 20 year is the most common?

For the amount, I've seen suggestions of 10x to 15x your *gross* income. But aren't insurance benefits un-taxed? So why is it based on gross? And where does this rule of thumb come from? If I died *today*, my wife would be losing over $4M in expected lifetime earnings. Yet we'd be buying a policy for roughly half of that?

I've also seen methods such as ""determine your monthly expenses you need to replace, then add in remaining debt that needs to be paid off, anticipated expenses (e.g. college savings), and that's your replacement amount."" But that seems overly complicated? All those factors are real (I have a mortgage, I'll be saving for college), but those will all be covered from my salary. So what's the point in breaking all that out vs just using something based on my salary?

My last job was not stable. They had gone through three rounds of layoffs, and I was supposed to be included in the last one until someone happened to quit just before, which saved me.

So I started applying elsewhere, and got (and accepted) an offer as a remote employee for a company in CA. 

My first day was this past week, and I started signing up for benefits. And I realized there's no paid maternity leave. They're a California-based company, and expect you'll use the state offered disability and leave. Which puts remote employees like me in a tough spot because my state (IL) doesn't offer anything similar.

[Here it is](https://i.imgur.com/iUPW3Nj.png). My interpretation is that there's a 3 month look-back *and* 12 month look-ahead for ""injury or pregnancy-related condition"". So sounds like I would not be eligible, but I called to try to confirm. 

The insurance provider redirected my call to my own 3rd party HR provider. I explained the situation and the phone rep very quickly said ""Oh yeah, you'd be eligible."" I tried to clarify and say ""I know I'm eligible to sign up, but can you confirm I'd be eligible for a pregnancy related claim given the pre-existing condition clause?"" And they said ""Yes, you would be eligible."" I asked for that in writing, and they agreed to send an email, which never came.

Now I'm not sure what to do. It seem pretty clear I wouldn't be eligible, but I'm being told the opposite. And even if I 'got it in writing', if/when my claim got denied, I'm not sure an email from an HR person would hold much weight.

I've been a regular reader of this subreddit for years, and it's helped put us in a great financial position. My wife and I are early 30s, make high-ish salaries, and have no debt besides our mortgage and car payment. We track every penny we spend, contribute 20% to retirement accounts (plus 4% employer match) and have also been saving aggressively outside of that. We have our first child on the way, so we have those expenses to consider. Most notably will be daycare. We are also hoping to move in the next 3 to 5 years to our 'forever home'.

With all that in mind, we're trying to decide how to budget and prioritize and plan for the future. Some example questions we have in mind: How much home can we realistically afford in the next 3 to 5 years, and how do we make a plan to get there? Given that timeframe, should we continue to invest outside of retirement accounts, or is potential down payment money better suited for a HYSA? Should we dial back our retirement savings to 15% to give us more flexibility? How much should we be saving for college? Is our currently amount of life insurance enough?

I know I haven't given enough information to answer those questions, so I'm more so wondering where we'd go to find the answer. For how great this subreddit is, it feels like heavy lifting to expect such tailored personal advice from strangers.

My wife and I jumped into home ownership about 3 years ago. We bought a ground-level condo that was new construction. And it's been a nightmare.

And now I'm in the middle of a major plumbing repair after the building water main sprung a leak in our kitchen ceiling (plumber said it was caused by corrosion due to using mixed metals). 

The building also has crumbling concrete in places, poorly designed HVAC which causes temperature variations, a garage that is too small for everyone to park in comfortably, a sump pump that died, sound isolation issues, a different ceiling leak from rain, a front gate out of alignment, fencing that is rusting, etc. It's just been a nightmare of one thing after another. It was built cheaply and poorly, and all the contractors we've had out have given the original construction a skeptical look or a raised eyebrow.

We had been planning to move in another 3 to 5 years after we had saved up some more money for an upgrade, but would it be crazy to move now/soon just to get out from under this place? Either a lateral move to a similar home, or just go back to renting for a few years?

Our mortgage company services our escrow account, and they were supposed to pay the property tax bill. On their website they even say ""You do not need to contact us or forward your tax bill to us.""

By mid September I was started to get nervous, because I hadn't received an update. I asked them if they had the tax bill, and they said yes, we are aware of the next bill, due *February 2022*. I told them no, there is a current bill. They said give them a few days to do an investigation.

I checked in a few days later, and they said ""We confirmed your next tax due date of February 2022."" I said, no that's not correct. They asked me to send them the bill, and said their review would be complete 10/7. 

A few days later, I got a noticed that they were transferring my loan, effective 10/1. When I asked about my taxes, they said don't worry, they'll be paid 10/7, including any late fees. The loan transfer is not relevant, since this started prior to the transfer.

So I waited patiently. Today is 10/8, and I contacted them. They said they have no record of any tax bill review.

Of course, they have no intention of resolving the discrepancy, since they don't hold my loan. So I've been waiting 17 days for nothing.

We recently purchased a new construction home, which meant the property taxes were based on the assessment on the old (demolished) home. We knew that the taxes would be reassessed at some point, and indeed, they were. And the new amount made my jaw drop.

We received a flier that said ""Let us appeal your property taxes. If no reduction, you owe us nothing. If we do get a reduction, pay a 30% contingency fee.""

stz4ba,rvH3Ah8zFtRX,"I was preparing to ask for a raise. Should the CPI increase influence my request?

I accepted a new job about a year ago and got a nice raise in the process. I've been quite happy so far - fully remote, lots of autonomy, relatively low stress, pretty good benefits, and good career development. But about 6 months ago, I started to get contacted by recruiters. I took introductory calls for 3 different positions, and the base salary ranged from 10% to 20% more than my current salary. And I was planning to bring this up during my annual review.

I don't necessarily expect to get open-market rates, but there is clearly a gap. I'm prepared to discuss my request from a performance perspective. But the reality is that they either need to make it more competitive, or be prepared for me to explore my options (obviously presented in a more diplomatic way). Basically that I don't want to have to listen to these phone calls, but right now I feel like I have to. 

But there have been all these headlines about 7, 8% inflation. Are people getting cost of living raises to keep up with this? Should I adjust my request upward based on this data?

Lets say you're happy at your current company, but feel that the market rate for your skills has increased over the past year. Maybe that's partially due to 7 - 8% YoY inflation, which seems like a valid concern when discussing cost of living adjustments. But I've seen several people say citing inflation is a bad strategy, since it doesn't say anything about your contributions.

The conventional wisdom is to demonstrate your value to your company, Which I suppose is always valid. But over my career, I've had mixed results with trying to translate various accomplishments and achievements into dollar values for the company. It's usually ""Good job, and we hear, you, but there's no budget.""

uqxam5,rvH3Ah8zFtRX,"New job offer includes ""phantom equity"" with 100% match. How should I value this?

I am currently considering a new job offer. It includes base salary + annual bonus. But there is an interesting ""phantom equity"" component to the bonus. Essentially, I may defer up to 30% of the bonus which the company will immediately match 100% (with a 3 year vesting period). Both the deferral and election become indexed to the company's common stock valuation for the duration of the vesting period.

I suppose there are two aspects of this:

1. Is the immediate 100% match (plus 3 year vesting) a good deal?

2. What is the expected return of the phantom stock shares?

I'm inclined to say #1 *is* a good deal. I can't think of many investments which would offer a guaranteed 100% return over a 3-year period. Although if/when I eventually leave the company, I could have up to 3 years of deferred money which will not receive that match.

The second one I have no idea. The company is a project developer (intentionally being vague here) and is receiving sizable funding from financial institutions and major industry players. So since it's not publicly traded, there's no share price I can look up. And I have no idea what ""increases to the company's common stock"" actually means.

The annual review process wasn't started until Feb 2022, and they laid out a timeline that said they expected headquarter approval on raises and bonuses in March, with them being paid out in April.

On April 29 our CEO sent an email saying that bonuses were still in the approval process and would now likely be May.

Let's say I was making $75k at my old job, which I held this year until June 30 (exactly half the year).

But as of July 1, I started a $100k job, and the IRS withholding calculator says I need to increase my withholding or else I'll owe a large amount next year. Why is that? Why wouldn't it just continue to be withheld at the proper rate? 

I have a guess, but I'm not sure if it's right - that my new company thinks I'm going to be earning $100k for only 6 months, so $50k total for 2022.

Just to explain my situation: I'm currently 26 years old and I worked at Oracle for 3 years from 2015-2018 and received RSUs from them. I didn't sell my RSUs at the time (wanted to avoid short term capital gains and didn't know at the time that selling them immediately would just give me the cash in my hand). So, I held onto them and have around 28.2k in ORCL stock sitting in my fidelity account (cost basis was 25.8k). I know that if I sell now, I will have to pay long term capital gains on the roughly 2k of growth, but that's not a huge deal. My question is more about what I should do with the money if I choose to sell, or should I just keep holding the RSUs?

I also have 5k in crypto holdings. Lastly, I have about 1k in my Fidelity brokerage account that's the result of me not using DRIP earlier, and so I invested the dividends from my original RSUs into some other stocks.

No worries there as prior to this year, I was below the income limit for  a Roth. However, last year I had a bit of a rough year and hopped between a few jobs and finally by August landed in my current job, which is now well above the Roth limit. After I filed my returns for this year back in February though, my AGI for 2019 was 78k or so, primarily because I worked for a month in February, and a month in May, and then August till the end of the year. If I had my current job, which I joined last August for all of 2019, I wouldn't have been eligible for a Roth contribution. But, am I correct in thinking that if my 2019 return shows an AGI of 78k, then I can contribute to my Roth for 2019 through July 15th?

Meaning, would 56.7% in VIIIX, 2.8% in VMCIX, and 10.5% in VSCIX along with 20% in VTSNX and 10% in VBTIX be a good allocation for a 26 year old? Thank you again!",Yes,Yes,No,No,No
hp1qv5,Sagarsaurus,"Critique my retirement account allocations please!

Hi all! I've been working on properly balancing my retirement accounts and I would really appreciate some feedback on how they're setup. If something seems wrong or downright stupid, I would love to rectify those mistakes right now. For context, I'm 26 years old and am maxing out my 401k (have tried to do so since I started working at 21), and contributed to a Roth IRA when I was under the income threshold, and am now well over it, and thus started backdooring money into it.

So here goes:
For my current employer, they don't have a Vanguard target date fund. They do have TRPLX but the expense ratio is a 0.52 which seemed very high. So I set out to configure that myself. I currently have 10% in VBTIX, 27% in VTSNX, and used the remainder to approximate VTSAX by putting ~51% in VIIIX, 2.5% in VMCIX, and ~9.5% in VSCIX. This is supposed to line up in approximation of the total US stock index by putting 30% of stock allocation internationally, and of the remaining 70%, putting 81% in the S&amp;P 500, 4% in mid cap index, and 15% in the small cap index. In total, there is about 26k in this account currently and I am contributing twice a month to max out contributions for this year at 19.5k. My employer also matches 100% upto 3% and then 50% on the next 3%. 

My old employer 401k hasn't been rolled over because I have it in VILVX which is Vanguards target 2060 fund with a 0.12 expense ratio, and thought it wise to leave it there. In total, there's about 67k in this account currently.

Finally, in my Roth IRA I currently have 17.8k, I reallocated recently and 12k of this amount is very recent with new contributions (within the past month with me putting 6k in for 2019 because I was under the income limit, and backdooring 6k for 2020 because I am now well over it). In this account, ~31.8% is in FREL, ~20.6% is in FTIHX, and ~47.6% is in FXAIX. I am doing all of this in fidelity hence the fidelity funds. I recognize that this is the area in which I may be better off reallocating so please feel free to tell me what you think I should change!

So long story short, I have about 17.5k invested in my Roth IRA. I put 5.5k in a few years ago, put 6k in for 2019, and backdoored 6k in for 2020 (well over the income limit now). Currently I have about 3600 in FTIHX, 8400 in FXAIX, and roughly 5500 in FREL (these values have gone up a little as the market has gone up, but these were the initial investments as of about a month ago). My question is, is this allocation too heavy on REITs and too low on the international stocks? Is it worth exchanging FXAIX for FSKAX or FZROX? My 401k is setup properly with about 28k in my current account (and 68k in my old account) with me essentially creating VILVX with the funds available to me (and by doing so, paying a lower expense ratio than owning a specific target date fund, in fact the only ones available with this employer are TRP funds, which have high expense ratios). 

For more context, I'm 26, if that helps. I just want to get an idea as to whether or not I should rebalance this Roth Account somehow now. Once the allocation is set, I'll continue to backdoor money in every year and divide it up with the determined allocation, and will of course change it as I get older to be less risky.

hwv583,Sagarsaurus,"Question about Roth IRA investments

Hi all! I have a question about the way my Roth IRA is structured. I've more or less built a 3 fund portfolio in my 401k, and figured that that's probably the way to go in my Roth IRA as well. Currently the value is around 18k of which about 5700 is in FREL, 8.6k is in FXAIX and the remainder is in FTIHX. My question is simply, is it worth owning FREL when I can just exchange my FXAIX for FSKAX, sell off the FREL, and of the proceeds, buy 70% FSKAX and 30% FTIHX?

Since FSKAX contains some real estate holdings is there any actual benefit in owning an ETF specifically for real estate? I'm 26 if that helps, and hold no bonds in my Roth, I do have 10% allocation of those in my 401k. Is this a sound thing to do? If not, what would you do differently?",Yes,Yes,No,Yes,No

ic0ph6,Sagarsaurus,"Helping my younger brother plan for retirement

Hi all!

So, I'll just jump into it. I am a 26 year old Software Engineer and so I have been contributing to my 401k since I was 21 which has grown to around 106k (I didn't know about maxing out my contributions in my first 2 years of contributing) and I have a Roth IRA that I've been putting money into which is upto around 18k (missed a few years, young naivety). I'm maxing everything out every year so as far as retirement goes, I think I'm pretty set.

However, my 22 year old brother is in the hospitality industry. Specifically, he went to the Culinary Institute of America and is now a Chef. However, I fully understand that incomes in that field are nowhere near where they are in mine (unless one becomes extremely successful or is a celebrity). The more and more I think about it, the more I realize that at his age, he needs to find a way to invest in his future. However, I know that he doesn't really have the funds to do that. He makes about $13 an hour, for now. It may go up next year to around $16 an hour but still, his apartment is 1300 a month, and he drives to work and pays his own utilities (wants to prove that he can do things independently but my dad cosigned his lease for him because he didn't meet the income requirement). In essence, after all the other things that he pays for such as utilities, gas, and food/groceries, his student loans, and trying to sock some money away into savings, he's essentially living paycheck to paycheck. He saves about $200 a month, and his savings account is at about 3k now. My question is primarily, knowing this, what can I do to help him plan properly for his future? Should I give him money to contribute to his Roth IRA? I'm at about 184k a year in total income (160k base salary, 24k bonus) with about 54k in liquid savings. I do have the funds to give him that money for that particular purpose. Is this something that you'd recommend that I'd do? Or is there something else that I can do to help him so he doesn't have to work till he's 100? His employer doesn't really offer many benefits so he doesn't have a 401k plan, and since he's under 26, he is saving a lot on insurance costs.

o5dglf,Sagarsaurus,"Order in which my fiancÃ©e should invest for retirement

Hi all,

My fiancÃ©e recently graduated from med school, and will be starting as a resident at the start of next week. Her gross income will be right around 65k. I was taking a look at what retirement plans she is offered, and it looks like she's offered a 403b through TransAmerica. I haven't gotten to look at the funds just yet, but I'm not sure that those should even determine the order in which she invests for retirement.

The 403b plan has no match from the employer for her first year, as you have to have worked there for atleast a year before they will match at all. She is doing a transitional year which means her first year or residency will be at this hospital, and then the next 3 will be elsewhere.

With her income being what it is, and knowing full well what her salary will be after she completes residency, the advice I want to give her is to actually forego the 403b until she maxes out her Roth IRA contribution for the year. At that point, it's fine to put money into the 403b, whatever she can spare, because that still has some tax advantages.

After this year, she should continue this pattern until she starts getting a match from her new employer (2 years from now as I'm assuming they won't match for the first year either). At that point, she should contribute enough to get the match, then max out her Roth contribution, and then continue to try to max out her 403b.

I've followed advice from this subreddit and have learned a lot. But recently I noticed a change in a bogleheads page that's making me wonder if my 401k is properly proportioned, specifically my US stocks. Currently my 401k doesn't offer VTSAX or any total US market fund so I have split my 401k into 2 categories (I've excluded bonds because I'm 28 currently).

Currently my portfolio is 30% in VTSNX and then 70% in my simulation of VTSAX based on what I read before. Currently, of my US allocation, I have 81% in VIIIX, 4% in VMCIX, and 15% in VSCIX.

When I was perusing the bogleheads wiki a few days ago I noticed that the recommended approximation has changed a lot. Something like 83% in S&amp;P 500, 8% in mid cap, and 9% in small cap.

Okay so for cycling Iâ€™m not paying attention to budget besides just trying to buy used.

For example, I bought a 2008 bike that MSRP was $8500 for $425 because I want that bike and itâ€™s for my health so I didnâ€™t worry about budget. I also bought a bike repair stand for $100 used.

When curious about who should buy a Rolex, one person said 1% of your net worth. So if you have a million net worth, buy yourself a $10k watch.

But with the bike, I would need $50k saved to buy $500 worth of bike and stand. But I only have $12k, so I went over.

So my question is, what is the actually budget? Should I stick with the 1% rule? Is there a different category since itâ€™s a bike as opposed to say a wallet or gaming console or watch?

In July, Lord willing I will get cleared in my hiring process and be earning $102k pre-tax working full time, will have at least 10-12k saved when I start, and paying just $1k a month for rent (live with mom).

I would jump in more easily at the chance to buy something I desired.

But now that I work I have this new thought pop in my head that Iâ€™ve never had before.

If I work overtime at my new job, I would make $73/hour, so I might be willing to do it there. I have free medical insurance from my job. I live with my parents and give $1000 a month to contribute. I don't own a house or have any other savings or any retirement/investment. My company says employees get fully vested after 5 years (not sure what that means, and we might even lose benefits like that as the current contract will expire and we are in negotiations through my union). I will supposedly also be getting a raise twice a year for the next 5 years or until I catch up to my coworkers, and I know at least one coworker makes around $65/hour after 7 years there (I'm at $49/hr).

I know the advice might be to put into retirement or invest and go towards a house and I have a 2017 car (mom gave me her car and still pays for it) but I feel the temptation and desire to get stuff like a new car at times. Also retirement/investing sounds scary and I'm also lazy to put in the work to figure that out. My mind becomes weak and I start thinking, ""well if I'm going to be making 100k, then how bad would it be to buy a 10k motorcycle?""

I don't think I spend too much on other stuff and don't travel.
  
So right now I'm struggling, when I see a ""comfy"" big escalade, or hear all the cool stuff about my coworkers Tesla and how he thinks it's worth it to have, and my commute back home is an hour, and I see motorcycles splitting passed everyone quickly.

I got scared because I just got a job and told myself I would max out the 401k next year so that I have a whole year to but in the max, not (now) 4 months.

Iâ€™m afraid I will crumble if I try to do that. I have 14k saved in my debit card.

25k in student debt ($240 per month) and $1500 in rent/bills. The rest is for me.

Is it really worth maxing out my 401k even at 70% if my paycheck? At this point I wouldnâ€™t even make it to maxing out with $5400/month.

I guess it's only 5 months but from my perspective I feel like it's stayed this amount forever.

I wanted a $25k Harley after buying a $3k Yamaha vstar 1100, but after a couple months of owning it, I honest got over having a different bike. I don't even want a car anymore, or am actually considering selling my BMW to buy a very cheap used car as a back up.

So, I understand that we get paid so much weekly because we are supposed to duplicate expenses when away from our home. But, rates are going down dramatically, so I have a couple questions.

&#x200B;

My upcoming contract will pull in about $2200/week (in pocket, including stipends). This hospital is about 2 hours from my home and we are expected by the IRS (from my understanding at least) to live at this location full-time while on contract. However, that amount of money is not enough to pay for all my regular bills + live at the new area full-time. What I *could* do though, is stay in a hotel on the days I work and just drive home on my days off. Apparently that's not what the IRS wants you to do and can ding you for it??

&#x200B;

So my questions are: How do they expect me to pay all my bills at home AND live in a new area full-time? Even with the absolute cheapest place I could find it went over a bit. 

&#x200B;

Hypothetically speaking, I do what I mentioned and just stay in hotels on my work days and come home and then I get a surprise IRS visit. They tax you on all that tax-free stipend pay.

I am an RN and am currently working in the hospital as a staff nurse. I will be there approximately 9 months before moving to another state. I contribute to 403b but I donâ€™t max the hospitals match rate because Iâ€™ll be leaving and 0% vested. 

As an RN, itâ€™s not uncommon to bounce around especially if you decide to do travel contracts. My goal/plan at the moment is to do 1 year travel contracting, settle down in the ICU for 2-3 years as a staff nurse and then apply to CRNA school OR go the Nurse Practitioner route. 

That being said, Iâ€™ll basically be â€œfreelanceâ€ for 1 year. Staff nurse at one hospital for 2-3 years before starting school. CRNA school allows work for the first either year or semester, Iâ€™d have to look but after that itâ€™s 100% school. NP school, you can work through.

To make a long story short, I am a travel nurse. I currently make about $4000/week, take home. This is 4x the amount I made as a regular staff nurse. With this windfall of an opportunity, I was able to knock down $13,000 credit card debt, continue to pay the bills, I did....get a little carried away and spent a bit too but, wrangled that in lol. I owe $16,000 on a truck I have, we gave it to my FIL (he's 6'7"" and drives basically a PT Cruiser) and I am going to pay it off for him. I also bought myself a new truck. ***Best*** financial decision? Of course not. Did it make me happy and bring joy to someone who is less fortunate? Absolutely, so it was worth it to me.

&amp;#x200B;

My current expenses are $4200/mo which includes all utilities, groceries, mortgage, vehicle payments, insurance, etc etc. So I can pocket approximately $12,000/mo. However, my plan is to pay off the truck we gave to FIL. Save up 6 months of emergency fund. Contribute $12,000 to Roth IRA (2021 &amp; 2022). Then....by the time 1/12/2022 is aroound, I can start focusing on strictly bills and retirement.

&amp;#x200B;

I am curious though, because I am a travel nurse, I may hop companies etc to find the best pay rates. Fairly common. With that, I would assume I would lose one brokerage and be hopping all over the place?? (I'm not sure??) Should I even use their option or should I just open my own taxable account?

I am a travel nurse doing hospital contracts. Iâ€™m not a 1099. Some companies may offer X amount of dollars per week and some may offer 2x or 3x others. That being said, itâ€™s not uncommon to cherry pick contracts to maximize income. 

My current company requires 6 months working with them before allowing me to open a 401k and 12 months before they will begin to match. 

Now assuming I have to jump around to maximize income and all these other companies require something similar (I donâ€™t know if they do but just in case), would it make sense to, after maxing my Roth IRA, to start contributing to a taxable brokerage while waiting for 401k eligibility?

Bills are about $3800/mo which includes everything except electric and water. With those itâ€™s probably around $4100/mo. 

401k would be about $18,000
IRA $6000

Student loans arenâ€™t hitting me yet. Iâ€™m still in grace but, I owe $62,000 and am going to try to knock off the $19,000 I owe to SallieMae since itâ€™s accruing interest.

So I must still technically be an employee, then? I don't receive any paychecks from them, of course, and don't have W2s sent to me from them, either. 

I'd like to make it clear that I don't exactly miss this job, either. It was terrible in a number of ways. I'm also moving several states away in a few months so it doesn't make sense to go back anyways. For reference, I live in Pennsylvania. What do I do about this? Can I tap into these benefits at some point even though I haven't worked there in so long?",No,Yes,No,No,No
g0ln2f,SchluberSnootins,"Can I keep a secure card account open but never use it?

For the past two years, since I was 18, I've been building my credit. I've got it pretty high now (745) and want to look into getting a cash back rewards card, which credit karma says I have a very good chance of getting approved for. I currently have 3 cards- a secure card (my oldest) and two store cards, one of which is a visa I can use and get points for spending outside of the store. These have really helped me in building my credit.

I was talking to a friend (who's in his 30s, so not super young) and he said that if I wanted to, I could pay off the entire secure card, get a new one, and just never use the secure card again while still keeping the account open so I can maintain the existing line of credit.

kioir7,SchluberSnootins,"Should I buy a house or rent an apartment?

Hi all, I'm looking to receive a fairly large settlement in the next year or two due to an accident I was involved in. It's expected to be well into the six figures. As a result of this accident I've been out of work for months but I'm projected to be medically cleared to work by early to mid 2021. Right now I'm taking advantage of the free time to learn IT work online and earn certifications. IT jobs in my state start out at a base of around $45k a year for just entry level. The average COL here is $32k a year. 

The thing is, I moved states two months ago and living with family. I'm living in a place I've always wanted to live in, 10 minutes from a beach. It's literally a dream come true for me. There's tons of job opportunities, growth, and the housing communities around here are not only nice but inexpensive, ranging from $100k-$200k for a house. 

And this is where my question comes into play. 

If I receive a fairly large settlement, say $500k, I've wondered if I should buy a house around the area. Of course, I wouldn't do any of this until I have a stable, liveable job, but still. 

I absolutely love the area I live in. It's beautiful, warm, and there's lots of job opportunities. It's the fresh start I had been waiting forever for. I could definitely settle down and have a home here. Should I buy a home within the $100k-$200k range or rent out an apartment to get experience living on my own first?

I feel like buying a home would be the smarter move, financially speaking, especially if I could pay it in full at once. I also don't have a car yet, but my father plans to sell me his car for the remainder of what's left on it ($16k currently, it's a few years old but very well taken care of)

Or perhaps I should just wait it out and give myself more time as an individual? I just feel like I've gotten an opportunity that almost no one my age ever gets and I want to use it to the best of my ability. Having a paid off home at a very young age could be a huge advantage in my life and really get me ahead of the game. I don't want to blow this money, I want to use it wisely.

My dad wants to sell me his car for $14k, its KBB value. It's a 2017 Honda Civic and he has been the sole owner of it, and it's in excellent condition. It doesn't even have 100k miles on it yet. He said that since I'm buying it from him I'd be better off buying it outright when I get the money. That's fine by me, but I have also heard you can finance through a bank as well. I thought about financing a small amount of it to open a line of credit history and also to avoid paying a large amount of interest. Part of me really wants to just pay it outright and have the peace of mind of not having a payment, but part of me wonders if that'll hurt my credit in the long run. My credit is 755/758 Transunion/Equifax respectively, so it's in the ""excellent"" range.

Hi all, I'm currently in a situation that's given me an incredible opportunity in life I could have never dreamed of. I'm 21 and have recently received a six figure settlement. With this settlement I plan to buy my dad's car for ~$14k and have a fully paid off vehicle. I'm currently not employed, but am actively job searching. My credit is excellent, I have no debt and currently live with my parents. We moved into a new area late last year and I absolutely love it here; it's beautiful, there's plenty of job opportunities, and the COL is only $35k a year. 

But I find myself in an interesting situation. A house in my neighborhood is for sale at $60k in a neighborhood where most homes are $100k+. The price difference alarms me a little, but it could be an opportunity. With my settlement and personal savings, as well as when I'm employed, I could have a paid off home and car starting off in life and still have nearly $100k left over. I really feel like this would be a great opportunity for me and it could set me on a great path in life. I'd be a short walk from my parents' house, so moving in would be easy, and I could stay in the neighborhood where I'm making side cash mowing for elderly neighbors.

I feel like I have a great opportunity in my hands that almost no one my age has and I don't want to squander it.

Hey all, been crunching some numbers lately and wondering if a potential future plan is in any way plausible. I currently work at a job I love making $12 an hour, but am working through training programs to progress my career and get pay raises. I work almost full time (will go full after probation) but currently make $1,920 a month before taxes. I'll make a bit more once I go full time though. I'm in a serious relationship and if we end up tying the knot and moving in together we'll make a total of $4,640 pre-tax. I have the idea of buying a condo in my area, which is very transient with people moving in and out all of the time, so I'd aim to pay it off and use it as a rental property in the future. Condos in my area run from $100-120k. I have a paid off car and no debt.$65k in the bank with my parents gradually paying back $40k I loaned them in an emergency. So will have roughly $100k by the time they fully pay it back. 

My gf doesn't have a license or car, and her parents used her credit cards and ran them up to $3k+ in debt. She wants to get that fixed before considering anything further between us. My credit on the other hand is near 800. We're both 22. 

I've told her the idea and she thinks it sounds good, as the idea is to buy one condo, pay it off, save for another, then buy a second one and rent it out, putting a tenant's rent toward the mortgage, rinse and repeat. It's a very long term plan but I'd like to own 2-3 condos as an investment strategy.

lwza14,Scryptiid,"What are the best resources those with experience can suggest for increasing financial literacy, and choosing my next steps?

TL/DR: 22 M, where should I learn more about personal finance? Where should I look into opening an IRA? Is it worth moving to online banking? What should I look for? What do you wish you had known/done in your early 20s?

Hello PF,

Iâ€™ll try and keep things concise, but Iâ€™m notoriously bad at that. For reference, Iâ€™m 22, working part time and until recently was a full time student. Iâ€™m taking a break from school to focus on some personal enrichment and pursuing other goals. I do have a A.S. degree in CIS. 

First off, Iâ€™ve felt for a year or so now like my financial literacy is not where I want it to be. Thereâ€™s a lot of concepts I want to learn and understand more about such as tax structure, investment (stocks and real estate primarily), and more effective ways to both budget and save. Savings accounts arenâ€™t the way to go. What are some good objective resources that you could suggest for learning these topics? I find I have a hard time trusting online resources to not have some form of bias or agenda. I donâ€™t have anyone in my life I particularly consider a good resource. 

Second, as idealistic and unrealistic as it may sound, I want to pursue financial independence. I donâ€™t want to rely on paycheck to paycheck, 9-5, Iâ€™m sure youâ€™ve heard it all. My efforts so far mean I have no debts, no loans, am slowly building credit with a card, just trying to make smart decisions. I have little financial obligation and can save a large percentage of my income. Next step seems to be putting money towards retirement? My employerâ€™s retirement plan is whack, and has little benefit to me so Iâ€™ve considered maybe an IRA? I understand the basic ideas but donâ€™t feel like I have enough information to make the optimal decision. A Roth seems smarter than a traditional for my circumstances, especially with zero sight on what retirement will look like for me. Iâ€™ve wanted to look into using TD Ameritrade for exploring/trying/learning about trading as well as potentially opening an IRA but would like to get more experienced opinions. 

Third and last for now, my current short term goal is purchasing another car. My hobby is tinkering with and building engines. My cars have always been a little unreliable and less than practical. Now I can finally afford to make a smarter decision. I have money in savings, that I specifically saved for this purpose, just waiting for the right car. I chose a while ago to reduce my spending budget so that I would have extra money to put towards investment, a retirement account, whatever it may be. Where should I start? I feel like Iâ€™ve learned a lot recently, but itâ€™s almost too overwhelming to know what I want/need to do. 

I appreciate your time and any responses given. I look forward to learning, growing, and improving myself here amongst all of you, and hopefully passing on what I learn to others.",Yes,Yes,No,Yes,No
m0q29s,Scryptiid,"What details should I pay attention to when deciding where to open an IRA? Explain target date funds to me?

After my last post, I'm hoping to be more specific about my lack of understanding. I have read the prime directive and generally understand the steps, and options for them. Going by that, I think a smart move for me is to open and begin funding an IRA (Likely a Roth). I'm 22, working part-time (Making more than my previous full-time) and have no debts or loans. I'm on break from college, but have paid it all out of pocket, and don't plan to have student loans anytime soon. My employer does not offer a 401k and their offered retirement plan likely doesn't apply to me, because I don't think I will be employed with them long enough to actually benefit. It's a really odd and kinda bad plan.  


I can afford to make maximum contributions to an IRA, but I'm not sure where I should open one. Currently I'm banking with Chase, but it seems like general consensus is to get away from the large brick and mortar financial institutions. I don't trade, but would like to learn to. Am I best off joining a credit union, and going through them? Going online with something like Fidelity or TD Ameritrade? Or sticking with Chase, if they offer one? 

I don't entirely understand the differences in fund and investment offerings from the online brokerage options. I also don't really know how I would use a target date fund, because I have no idea when I would retire or how to gauge that. The earlier, the better. And lastly, I don't know if it's beneficial to manage my own investments (which would require a lot of research and learning from here), or to just fund an account I don't need to really manage.  


To clarify, I know what most of these things ARE, but not how they really apply, or what I need to personally pay attention to. No one in my family is all that financially literate beyond average, so I've never learned much other than what I can read, and digesting it is tough sometimes.",Yes,Yes,No,Yes,No
o5ur1w,Scryptiid,"Check-In for a new investor

Hello all, new to the sub and Iâ€™m hoping I can get a little guidance or advice, as well as check that Iâ€™m on the right path. For reference, Iâ€™m 23 and still living at home with family, and not currently in college. I donâ€™t have current plans to return, but that could change. 

I started a new job about a year ago, and was able to take care of some debts and spent time reducing my expenses. With the newly free resources, I did some reading and decided to start with retirement. I opened a Roth IRA through Fidelity, and am making regular contributions that are being invested in a 2065 target date index fund (FFIJX) with a 0.12% expense ratio. Iâ€™m going to work towards maxing my contributions yearly, which I should be able to do. 

My employer does not offer any sort of matching or 401k. They have a bizarre state retirement program I donâ€™t really understand, but I donâ€™t plan to live here long enough for it to be relevant to me. 

Iâ€™d like to gather opinions on whether or not this is the right start, or if Iâ€™m missing something important? And advice on where to go, what to do next? I want to create security for later in life, but would also like to put efforts towards early retirement or financial independence.

o5vmfb,Scryptiid,"I feel like I am missing an important concept in investing when it comes to money in the pocket, and could use insight.

Just like many, I have interest in passive income and hopefully early retirement (even financial independence). Iâ€™ve taken to reading a lot recently about investing and financial fundamentals. As far as my own efforts, all Iâ€™ve done so far is start investing in a target date index fund for my retirement, through my Roth IRA. No employer options or matching. 

However, in all these readings, Iâ€™m struggling to understand how stocks investing really translates to money in your pocket. I understand how assets like real estate do, and I also understand some stocks pay dividends, but I canâ€™t help feeling like Iâ€™m still missing something important. What do I need to be learning/exploring to look in passive income through investing? 

For example, if I were to buy stock in Berkshire Hathaway (been reading about Buffett, random example with no meaning) and it were to pay dividends, is the idea to keep reinvesting that money into buying more/other stock?

obugvn,Scryptiid,"How and more importantly where should I divide/store extra funds for retirement/big goals?

There are a couple questions wrapped up in here and Iâ€™ll try and make each one clear. Iâ€™m at the point where my income is still relatively low, and Iâ€™m working on that, but I should have some extra money left over to go to retirement and goal savings after doing the other steps laid out in the PD. This includes maxing my Roth to the contribution limit. 

First, how should I divide my savings after that between more retirement and my next big goal which will be moving out? Not sure if I want to buy a place or rent, just know that itâ€™s my next big step. (Unless I go back to college, which will shift everything. Currently donâ€™t plan to.) PD mentions 15% for retirement first then to savings for something like a house but at that point Iâ€™d probably be decades from getting my own place. 

I trust others know better than me, so it would make the most sense if Iâ€™m doing that to just invest 15% of each paycheck, and the remainder into house savings? Or does someone have a better method? 

Related, whatâ€™s the next place I should put retirement savings if my employer offers nothing and my Roth is maxed? An individual 401k or something of the sort? I need to research the options listed in the PD but advice always helps. 

Second, as far as organization, Iâ€™d really like to be able to keep my goal savings, emergency fund, short term savings for small purchases, etc. all in separate places or views rather than piled in one savings account. It sounds like some online banking solutions offer this type of structure and organization. Is it worth moving my â€œbankingâ€ to one of these for this? Any suggested one? I donâ€™t really want my money spread through a dozen institutions. Just curious how others are staying organized.

This is a pretty simple question, but Iâ€™m wondering where it would be best for me to keep my emergency fund money. Mostly for organizational reasons. Iâ€™d like to separate it from my traditional savings account, but obviously keep it accessible. 

One option would be to just open another savings account at my bank. Not opposed to this, but Iâ€™m wondering if thereâ€™s measurable benefit to moving both savings accounts to an online banking solution that offers an HYSA, potentially with buckets to handle my structuring/organization. 

Is there really reason to do so? Or should I just stay with my current bank and open a new savings account? I have an IRA for retirement savings, and additional will probably go into a taxable account. I donâ€™t currently have one.

Hello all. Couple of quick questions. Iâ€™m planning to open a second credit card, in the hopes of helping build credit over time. Primary reasoning is to have more than one account and to help keep utilization down. Realistically, I very rarely use my card, and I never carry a balance, but the reading Iâ€™ve done seems to point to this being a good idea. Am I missing something?

Should I open one of the pre-approved cards through my bank? Or are there better options to look into? Iâ€™m only considering cards without an annual fee.

ogykg5,Scryptiid,"Planning savings going forward.

Hello all. Apologize if this is confusing. My thinking tends to be all over. Iâ€™ve been reading the articles about budgeting and am moving towards smarter saving, in order to reach a number of goals I have set out. I understand the basic idea that is laid out, but want to know more about how to determine savings for retirement vs long-term or short term goals. 

From what Iâ€™m reading, ideal would be 20% savings (after requisite payments/needs are met and emergency fund is saved) towards retirement after doing everything possible to maximize savings in tax-advantaged accounts. Maxing is my current step, but Iâ€™m trying to lay out some numbers for after that, as I should have my IRA contributions maxed in a month or two. 

Once that is done, am I then taking 20% of my normal paycheck (paid monthly with extra in summer), putting that into a taxable account for retirement  (no 401k, pretty sure Iâ€™m not qualified for HSA), and then the rest being discretionary? By which I mean, Iâ€™m free to put that towards spending OR savings goals not related to survival? If not, what rate/percentage would be recommended for savings towards goals? I donâ€™t have a concrete time horizon. Sooner would be nice, but nothing necessitates it. 

Curious how others break it down. 

For reference, my long term goals are to save for a house down payment and another car. I understand financially the car is completely unnecessary and potentially inadvisable, but racing is a hobby and Iâ€™d rather not break my reliable transportation. Short term, Iâ€™m looking to build myself a computer. Otherwise, not much else I care to spend money on other than occasional outings when feasible. 

Iâ€™ve separated my emergency fund savings into another account to avoid the temptation of drawing upon it. Should my short term savings just stay in a savings account as well, while long term is saved in that taxable account?

Iâ€™ve been contributing to a Roth IRA, as that makes sense to me.

Now itâ€™s about maxed, along with a finished emergency fund for now, and Iâ€™m putting extra money aside to invest in a taxable account. I donâ€™t have a 401k or HSA available to me currently. 

The boglehead advice to tax efficient placement seems to suggest that tax inefficient investments should be in a tax advantaged account, such as the IRA. Following that logic, a tax efficient investment like an index would go in the taxable account and things like REITs or stocks should go in the IRA? It seems like the advice kinda flips backwards. Hoping someone can clarify for me. 


To that end, I have other savings allocated for short term goals, so the taxable account is ideally going to be extra retirement/wealth accumulation in the long term. In the taxable account, is this where I should be looking at a three fund portfolio? Iâ€™m understanding most of the ideas, but not quite how they go together. I might just be missing something in the reading though.",Yes,Yes,No,Yes,No
owhuys,Scryptiid,"Direction on investment/understanding asset allocation

Hello all. Iâ€™m at a point where I need to start using a taxable account for investment. Itâ€™s probably going to be primarily for retirement purposes alongside my IRA (no 401k offered, no HSA) but the overall goal is just building wealth and letting the money do its thing. I have other savings in place for short term and medium term goals, but being young, I know some things may change. Iâ€™m just putting aside some extra money to start early. 

What Iâ€™m struggling to understand is, if my IRA is invested in a target date index, how does that affect the choices I should make for investing with the taxable account. In general, Iâ€™d like to stay more hands-off so Iâ€™m considering the 3-fund approach, but am starting with smaller amounts invested, and the investment amounts will grow. Do I need to consider the allocation/ratio of both together? Or can I let the target date handle its balance, and just balance the allocation of the 3-fund along the general guidelines as it if it were alone? I havenâ€™t decided on a bond allocation, still reading on that, but if I used the age rule of thumb, it would be 20-25% bonds. 

There is also the suggestion that bonds should be held in a tax advantaged account for efficiency reasons, but my plan was to max the IRA solely investing in the target date. Is that not what I should be doing?

In summary, is it a bad idea/missing something, for me to invest my IRA fully in a target date index, and then have the taxable account (which is basically overflow money) be a 3-fund balance of US stock index, international stock index, and bond index, based on whatever allocation is suggested/decided?

oydg6d,Scryptiid,"Investing with Fidelity: Adding a taxable account to portfolio

Iâ€™d like to preface by thanking the members of this sub for setting me on a strong path going forward. I have significantly more confidence and lack of stress regarding finances, purchasing, and my goals. So thank you you all for your advice, criticism, and suggestions. 

I have both a Roth IRA and taxable account via fidelity. The Roth is new, but I intend on maxing my contribution this year. I do not have a 401k or HSA, nor are they option at this time as far as I am aware. For reference, Iâ€™m currently 23. 

Because of this, the advice has been to use a taxable account for extra money I want to invest. Iâ€™m hesitant to say itâ€™s all for retirement, but I have no specific goals for it right now other than long term wealth generation. Maybe early retirement. I have savings for other goals, as well as an emergency fund, in an HYSA and would balance investing and saving after maxing the IRA each year. 

My IRA is fully being invested in a 2065 target date (FFIJX). I am looking to build a 3-fund for the taxable account. Technically 2 right now, as I donâ€™t feel the need for bonds. Iâ€™m looking at FZROX and FZILX after reading the Bogleheads page. My questions are as follows:

1. They donâ€™t suggest Fidelity Zero in taxable accounts because itâ€™s a taxable event when trying to transfer to another brokerage. How much concern should I have about this? If itâ€™s a large concern, what is my best method of optimizing my investments for tax efficiency?

Edit: After more reading, I understand where, how, and why this could be a potential issue/drawback. However, I am unsure of the best way to work around it and avoid the potential pitfall. Suggestions or insight would be greatly welcomed. 

2. Are there any large merits to taking FSKAX or FTHIX instead? The note I see is that FZILX doesnâ€™t contain international small-cap. Is this reasoning for FTHIX instead? Iâ€™m lost on the subtleties/specifics. 

3. From what I understand, zero funds allow for fractional shares, which might be beneficial, since at times I might be moving smaller amounts into that account. Or is my thinking flawed?

I appreciate any and all feedback. I tried gleaning what I could from older posts here as well, but these questions stood out.",Yes,Yes,No,Yes,No

Hello all. Iâ€™m looking at creating a 2-fund account (3 later when bonds are added) to sit alongside my Roth IRA, which is fully invested in a target date index. For tax reasons it seems most efficient to go with total market ETFs (as opposed to mutual funds). I originally had considered some Fidelity mutual funds but after more research, am thinking it would make more sense to invest in VTI/VXUS for the time being, with bias towards VTI.

p0wlbe,Scryptiid,"Reviewing the current plan: Am I making a tax mistake?

Hello PF. Apologies if this is redundant to questions often asked, but I just want to solidify my confidence in my plan before diving straight into it. 

Iâ€™m 23M, emergency fund is done, no debt, and have a Roth IRA Iâ€™m planning to max every year and it is invested in a target date index. No other current tax advantaged options I am aware of for me. 

I have a new taxable account with minimal money in it, but plan to invest in VTI and VXUS, leave it long term. Just as overflow after my IRA contributions and other savings goals are met. When I get older Iâ€™ll add more bonds but my IRA already has 10% from the target date, if I read correctly. The account is basically for retirement and wealth accumulation. Maybe Iâ€™ll pull money before retirement but only if it becomes necessary for whatever reason. With proper planning, I hope to mitigate that risk. 

Just want to be sure Iâ€™m not making some sort of mistake regarding taxes. I was told to use tax-sensitive investments, which I only partially understand so far, but the general reading and research Iâ€™ve done seems to indicate this is a solid choice for a basic, mostly hands-off method of investing.

rmbwkh,Scryptiid,"What should I be looking into next for investing and literacy?

Hello all. Iâ€™m doing some planning for my goals next year, and looking for advice or thoughts on what I should do/learn next given where I am at. 

Iâ€™ve looked through the wiki many times and used it for reference, and as of now, I have a Roth IRA maxed for this year, invested in a target date index fund, and an individual account invested in VTI and VXUS. Iâ€™ve got my emergency fund stashed away, no debts, bills arenâ€™t a concern, no complaints there. Occasionally though, I feel like I donâ€™t know enough or Iâ€™m not doing enough. 

What should I be focusing on next year regarding savings and investing? For me, first step will be maxing the IRA again, but after that, is it a case of taking the recommended 15% for retirement and investing that in the taxable account? 401k isnâ€™t an option through my workplace currently. 

My end goal is FIRE but Iâ€™m currently 23, so the details are still pretty vague on the when and how. Too many variables that will change in the next few years. 

With that in mind, do I want to increase that 15% (when possible) being saved for retirement to a higher percentage? Should it continue to go to my simple two-fund traditional account (after IRA is maxed) or are there better methods I need to consider first? Should I be concerned myself with exit strategy for the future now? Or just as I move forward? 

Is there some diversity Iâ€™m really missing out on that I should be looking at including within the traditional account? I was just reading through others discussing small cap vs large cap, and realizing that I still have minimal literacy. I like the relatively hands-off approach this affords me, but I donâ€™t want the draw of simplicity to rob me of any major potential with my goals, or lead me too far astray.",Yes,Yes,No,Yes,Yes
rsowae,Scryptiid,"Roth IRA investing: Target-date index vs VTI/VXUS

Hello all. Little background info real quick, I started a Roth IRA this year and itâ€™s invested in a target date index fund (FFIJX). This was the advice I was given/found when I first started putting money aside for investing. I also have a taxable account with a small amount in VTI and VXUS. 

Someone mentioned to me, because Iâ€™m so young (23), I may be better off investing in VTI/VXUS in my IRA rather than the target date, as it is already beginning to add bonds into the mix, and has a higher expense ratio. 

Just looking for some insight into those two different options. From what I seem to understand, I can move my investments within the IRA from the target date to VTI/VXUS or other choices  without penalty or taxation as long as Iâ€™m not withdrawing anything? 

Should I consider adding others into the mix IF I donâ€™t stick with the target date? Or let the two indexes named cover things for the time being? 

The taxable account was partially just experimenting with small amounts, but also the fact that I donâ€™t have a 401k option and hit the contribution limit for the Roth.

ruvsaw,Scryptiid,"Investing direction for IRA + taxable account retirement savings: TDF + indexes in second account or all TDF in both?

Hoping this is a relatively simple question, kind of a follow up on some of the last info I got from here. Apologies if this sounds similar to previous questions of mine, just trying to work through some of the details.

23 years old, currently have a Roth IRA fully invested in FFIJX (2065 target date index) and a taxable account invested in VTI + VXUS. The IRA takes priority, and I donâ€™t have a 401k option. The taxable doesnâ€™t have much going in currently, just when I have some extra and the IRA is maxed for the year. 

Reading through some other subs and posts, Iâ€™m having a hard time discerning the common advice. Should I keep doing as I am, maxing the IRA and saving overflow in the taxable with my current index investments? Or should I hold the same TDF in both accounts?

I understand that I shouldnâ€™t have multiple investments in the same IRA account as the TDF, at least currently, and I know Iâ€™ll have to occasionally rebalance the taxable account doing this. When I have a 401k option, that will change things but I donâ€™t expect that for a while. 

The other suggestion I was given was to ditch the TDF entirely to go VTI + VXUS to have a lower expense ratio and no bond allocation. The TDF is a 0.12 expense ratio. Considering my balances arenâ€™t all that high right now (started just last year), the difference seems pretty negligible, and itâ€™s nice to have at least the IRA pretty hands-off while Iâ€™m still learning. I just want to make sure I continue to move the right direction this year and have a general plan of attack.",No,Yes,No,No,No

I recognize that everyone is suffering in the current market, and I just happened to have the luck of learning about/starting to invest during the beginning of COVID while I was bored and could do a lot of reading. 

Iâ€™ve got a Roth IRA that I max each year, with my money being invested in FSKAX and FTIHX. Donâ€™t have a real 401k option but Iâ€™m utilizing the options I have through work, which are negligible currently. Once those are handled, Iâ€™m using a taxable account and investing in VTI/VXUS.

The typical rule of thumb I've heard is that you should have 20% down to avoid PMI.  That's about $40,000 cash for a 200k house, and that's a pretty modest sized house in today's market.

I currently make about $60,000 a year and am still in the process of paying student loans.

Just to keep things simple, I'm only going to look at federal tax brackets ([https://www.nerdwallet.com/article/taxes/federal-income-tax-brackets](https://www.nerdwallet.com/article/taxes/federal-income-tax-brackets)):

Ok, suppose you currently make $70,000 per year, and suppose inflation is exactly 3%, and your employer gives you a 3% raise to compensate for that

Year 1: you make $70,000 gross and pay $11,148.50 in taxes giving you **$58,851.50** after taxes (with 22% being your highest tax bracket)

Year 2: you now make $70,000 x 1.03 = $72,100 and you now pay $11,148.50 + $2,100(0.22) in taxes leaving you with **60,489.50**

So your real Year 2 take home pay in Year 1 dollars is $60,489.50/1.03 = **$58,727.70,** which is slightly less than you made last year.

Or to look at it more simply, the raise you receive will always be taxed at your highest bracket, so you only actually see 78% of your raise (in this example).  So in order to truly be protected from inflation, your employer should give you current annual inflation x (1 + top tax bracket), or 3.66% in this example.

1815bqa,SeparateFly,"Seeking Advice: Use my Savings to Pay Off Student Loans at 6% or Mortgage a New Home?

I'm torn between two financial decisions and could use some advice. This is my situation:**Debt:** $160K student loans at average of 6% interest.**Income:** $250K/year.**Savings:** $210K in stocks and cash.

**Two Options:**

1. **Pay off the student loans:** This would save me from ongoing 6% interest payments and free me mentally.
2. **Buy a home:** Considering a home in the $800K-$900K range, with a $210K down payment. The mortgage interest would be around 7-8%, but I could house hack and rent out a room. Still, the student loans remain. My rationale for considering a home purchase is that the rent I've paid over the years could have potentially gone towards owning a property by now.

I guess a best scenario might be purchasing a home now and crossing my fingers for a decrease in interest rates in the near future. This could potentially allow me to refinance both the mortgage and student loans at a lower rate.

Now, I don't know what rate I will get from the lenders, the ""ideal"" situation would be the developer's lender gives me the lowest rate AND i get credit so I don't need to think twice. But, one of my lenders did say I could refinance to get a potentially lower market rate after I sign with the developer's lender (and reap the lender credit benefit) since the lenders for developers don't necessarily give best rates.

I am looking for new job but I feel this question on determining offers is more of a personal finance question:

I noticed some companies provides pretty high 401k contributions (not 401k matching) vs bigger companies. For example, one company has 4% matching, 4% contribution and 2-6% year end 401k contribution. I am curious how much weight one should put that into consideration for whole package vs pure salary? Assume that vesting period doesn't play a role. 

Ex:

Company 1 pays you 100,000 with 2% 401k contribution = 102,000

Company 2 pays you 95,000 with 10% 401k contribution = 104,500

On paper the value of Company 2's offer trumps 1. However, the  difference in salary means i have less to spend now vs more saved on the backend. Also, I suppose I am not getting taxed on the difference in this example which is nice.

I guess from savings standpoint, the extra contribution can count towards how much I would've saved anyhow if I took home more of the paycheck? But also 401k contribution is not guaranteed right? just because 12% this year doesn't mean it stays that way next year? But salary is...

v7xrqb,shaselai,"Question about offer and if I should accept or reject

So I received an offer from a company and I am thinking whether I should accept or reject:

Some notes:

1. 3k more pay (they had to eat the 3k to offer it )
2. 7k sign on
3. Healthcare - 0 copay and out of pocket (just 25$ per paycheck). Recruiter said when she had a baby she paid 0 out of pocket VS copay for current job
4. 10 days more PTO
5. 401k is wash
6. 99% remote (may need to come to office on a blue moon) vs 8 min commute on current job
7. Skillwise current work has more exposure to couple of additional technologies.

My friend does mention about recession incoming and how now I should strike while iron's hot. Just kind of curious if I should continue to look or take it?

My criteria is definitely 100% remote, pay and work. I would say this job hits the 100% remote and the offers i did get for 100% remote had lower pay as well. I do have some interviews coming up as well but they can't delay decision anymore.

vyvd44,shaselai,"How much value to put in work from home with comparing offers?

So I currently have 3 offers to consider:

1. 100% WFH and no risk of returning to on site. 8% 401k, 20 PTO. 190k - HR asked for counter(i know 200k is more or less the max for this title). Work is interesting in that it is using some new methodologies and I could learn a lot.
2. 10 minute commute, trying to push 200k (still need approval and they need verbal agreement first since they dont want to revise doc). 15% 401k, 25 day pto.  There's things to learn at work for sure, but underlying tech might not be as interesting as 1.
3. 10min commute,  they are making an offer 190k min, 28 pto, 8% 401k.  Work is interesting.

I know distance wise I am not saving a lot going WFH vs other 2 and 15% 401k can be substantial. The work for 1 is intriguing since it is doing something I have not done before and its analogous to all 3 jobs i can put more tools in my tool box BUT 1 introduces another box where I can put in different tools in it.

yd9tyo,shaselai,"Need help evaluating couple of offers

I have following offers - both IT, 40 hr weeks, similar distance, similar work and stability.

1. 195k base, 15% 401k (not matching just ""bonus"" to put into my 401k account even if i put in 0), 25 PTO. Can work Over Time (1.5) if I desire. Take home pay \~ 120k + \~30k from employer 401k
2. 220k base, 5% 401k, 20 PTO (can prob ask 5 more). Salary is at ""Do not exceed"" mark. Take home  136k + 11k from employer 401k

So both total value seems the same but money now vs saved is the big difference here - i calculated the take home pay assuming i put in 20k 401k myself as well.

One thing that ""concerns"" me is the ""do not exceed"" pay on offer 2. I have worked with companies that if you are at ""max payband"" you either don't get raises OR you need to be promoted to next level's pay band in which case you might be too expensive for the project and need to look for another project. Of course there may be additional other expectations for being promoted to next level as well. 

It does seem like option 1 has more ""future financial flexibility"" with not maxing out on pay and the project can even afford over time pay...

So the employer has 2 options-hsa plan with 3k employer contribution or non hsa plan .

Non hsa: 250 deductible, 2500 out of pocket, hospitalization deduc then no charge, other services just flat copay.

Background: Iâ€™m 20 years old and my only credit history is as an authorized user on my dads card. This has given me a score of 771 on credit karma and it says 12 years of history. 


Reasoning for post: I recently read the free 10xtravel course and like the idea of travel hacking and utilizing SUBâ€™s while maintaining an excellent credit score. I want to start building up points/miles now, so when I am around 23-25 I can use them to travel cheaply and efficiently. In the course, it suggests to have a 750 score and at least 1 year of credit history (not as an authorized user.) This brings me to my questions.


Questions: Since I need 1 year of credit and Iâ€™m 20 years old, I should probably start building my own credit anyway. Knowing that this will be my first ever credit card and you should never close your longest line of credit, should my first card be a catch all, no FTF card? Or what are yalls thoughts on what my first card should be?


I also have questions about utilization on credit cards. I sometimes spend $0/month and recently wanted a google photos subscription at $9.99/month to store/backup my photos and videos. Is $9.99/month on a credit card good enough or is that bad utilization and will hurt me?

Lastly, does anyone here practice the 10xtravel philosophy? Do points/miles ever expire if you never close the account? Is there anything I should know before getting into the hobby that wasnâ€™t said in the course? Also, can anyone explain the downgrading/canceling your card and how to do so whilst keeping an excellent credit score?

Robinhood Gold Membership = Free Money?

Itâ€™s been a while since anyone has posted about this subject and wanted to see what people think about it now. I am considering lump summing in January, but am not sure if this is a good idea.

Overview:  $5/month for Membership

3% IRA match (Must hold gold membership for a year) + (Hold IRA for minimum 5 years)

$1000 0% Margin Funds (Theoretically put this into 4.9% APY then pay back $1000?)

1% Transfers for IRAâ€™s and 401kâ€™s

4.9% APY (I know T-Bills are better, I currently use them)

So the math= 

$5 x 12 = $60/yr

$1000 in 4.9% APY = $49 when you must pay back $1000. This essentially means your membership is $11 until rates lower back down

If IRA contribution limit is $7000 next year, this means they will match you $210 of TAX ADVANTAGED money. Having this compound over the years will be huge. (if your time horizon allows.

Though I know these rates wonâ€™t last forever, would it be a good idea to withhold all my tax money (at least while rates are still high, once they drop I will revert to having my check withheld,) put the money in T-bills/HYSA, accumulate interest, then pay taxes in full like I wouldâ€™ve if they wouldâ€™ve been initially? 

This way I would make a little extra money for say christmas gifts, or vacation, or whatever I would like. 

In this plan, 1. is it worth it? 2. is there any discrepancies in my plan? please advise me!!",Yes,Yes,No,No,No
18hzza9,ShowtimeSplasher,"What should I do with $43,000

What should I do with $43,000?

Hi everyone,

I recently turned 20 years old, live with my parents, and only pay $200/month for groceries. I currently have and follow this routine:

Current Assets: 

Roth IRA: $14,251.70

Roth 401k: $30,994.53

Taxable Account: $3700.95

Money market/T-bills (5.364% annually): $42,669.55 

Routine: 

â€¢ I max my Roth IRA at 1st of every year

â€¢ I max Roth 401k throughout the year

â€¢ Put $1261.44/month into taxable account (50/50 VOO/VTI)

â€¢ Put $1261.44/month into T-bill/money market account on fidelity

Question: 

This whole time Iâ€™ve been saving and putting money into T-bills, I had the intent that I would save until I find a good investment to put a down payment on. For example, a rental property, storage facility, raw land, or a business.) Just anything to get cash flow. 

A year later and Markets higher than ever, here I am with $43,000 getting 5.364% annually and still no idea on which investment is my next big thing. 

What would yall do with the $43,000? Would you continue in T-bills? Put in VOO? Iâ€™m not sure when I will ever find the right buy to peruse, so iâ€™m not sure when I will need it. Could be 5 months or 5 years.

I also donâ€™t know if my routine is adequate. Should I be saving so much or investing in my taxable more? Please advise

Thanks to all of you who read and helped me out!!",Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes,No

Upon researching now, I am unsure which is smarter or if I should have a mix of both. Does anyone know what would be more beneficial?

Iâ€™m 20 & have, theoretically, 45 year time horizon if I absolutely have to work until 65.

Should I put it all in VTI or VOO and chill, if so which one? Have some international or is the S&P 500 enough?

I've spent weeks crunching numbers, but car prices and interest rates are so high that it's turning me off from wanting to buy a car at all. Even with a decent credit score, I would still qualify for a 5-7% interest rate, which is still high to me. I would have to put 40-50% down on some of these cars  just to get a 500-700 payment.

I've stayed home for this long to save money for a house over an apartment. Plus I like helping my mom with bills even though it's not needed.  I'm currently in contract to buy a duplex for 210k 1200sqft, 3br, 1.5 baths each side. I guess each side can rent for $900-1000 each side. 1 tenant is leaving on the 1st of April and the other is M2M. If I do end up closing on this property, I want to know the best way to handle it. I'm financing with 3% down with a portfolio loan, I'm not sure if I HAVE to owner occupy with this loan. So my options are.

1. Fully rent both sides and stay where I am now. ( $1800+ income )
2. Fully rent one side to strangers then stay on the other side and get 1-3 roommates. ( I  move out my mom's, live rent-free while making $1800+ income).
3. Fully rent one side and stay on the other side with my mom and grandma. ( This option makes less money because I would charge my mom less in rent ).

qqzh6k,SillyRecover,"25 Years Old And Don't Know What To Do About Living Situation. Looking For Advice.

I recently turned 25 and still live at home with my mother and grandmother. I have 50k saved and I make 50k a year. We split the rent 3 ways so I only have to spend $300 on rent each month. This has allowed me to accelerate my savings to what I have now.  The main reason I have stayed home this long is to save up enough money to buy a house ( preferably a duplex ).

I want to purchase a duplex and rent out one side with the tenant mostly paying the mortgage. While I stay on the other side with a roommate. By doing this I would live rent-free and could possibly be able to turn a profit ( At worst I live rent-free). I went to school for Real Estate at a young age ( 18 ) and I was educated on the Ins and Outs of housing. I learned that there are advantages to owning a home over renting an apartment.

In my city, a decent 2 bedroom apartment will run you about $1000-1100 in rent per month. Rents for most apartments in my city go up about $100 per year lately. For example, If I were to buy a 220k duplex ( Which is basically two houses ) my mortgage would be about $1200 for the life of the loan. In the end, the mortgage doesn't matter since I wouldn't be paying it myself. The thing is that millions of other Americans have realized what I explained above and are catching on. The housing market in my area is now EXTREMELY competitive and it's making it hard to land something desirable.

Over the last 2 years, I've slowly gained the desire to move out more and more. I want my own place that I can decorate and set up as I wish. I recently had a friend move to a new apartment and he has a spare room and he asked me to move in and I've been debating on it.

w9sue0,SillyRecover,"Is it worth it for me to open a 401k/retirement account ?

I'm 25 and I make 75k yearly and have 45k saved up. I work for a major insurance firm so there are a godly amount of benefits and perks to look over.  I've never really taken the time to open an investment account. Part of it is because I never really fully understood it. 

I switch jobs a lot in my career (1-3 years ) field. For most companies, you must stay there for 5 years to be fully vested. I never thought it was worth it if I knew I wasn't going to be with the company long anyway.  What happens to the money if I have to change companies ?. What if my new employer uses a different bank for their investment accounts ( fidelity vs wells Fargo ), does the money transfer over?

What if I leave the job in a year, will I lose the money that my company contributed over that time ?. I also don't know if I'm open to losing more of my paycheck. I already have to pay taxes, healthcare, bills, etc. I don't know how it works if I were to need the money in the account at a random time.  

Maybe I need to speak to HR or some sort of financial expert. I've been thinking of putting the money from my savings account somewhere to gain interest but I just don't know where. I don't want to put it in stocks because I could end up losing money. Banks don't really pay anything regarding interest for savings accounts. If I could put it somewhere and gain 1% interest a year without losing money that would be great.

I'm thinking of setting up a 401k with my job. My main fear is sending my money to an account and having to jump through hoops to withdraw it. I want to be able to withdraw it whenever I please with full control. I'm also curious if I'm taxed at a higher rate from withdrawing through 401k vs just receiving it in my paycheck.

I just recently started this job and I'm on a hybrid work schedule. I was told that after a couple of months of training I would be able to be fully remote due to personal reasons. I don't know if I should set up a 401K just to have to find another job in another 3 months. The 401k vendor is Fidelity, I know my HR department and Fidelity needs to answer most of these questions.

I was wondering if there are other important questions that I should be asking the employer about 401K ?

Do I have full control to withdraw the money for any reason?

What percent is matched?

What if I change employers, can the money be transferred without a fee ?

What if the new employer uses a different 401k vendor ?

do I have to be an employee for a certain amount of time before employer-matched money is mine ?

I made a thread similar to this a week ago and this is the follow up. I spoke to my company HR about 401K. They match 50% up to 8%. To be fully vested you have to be employed 5 years ( it escalates 20% a year until 100% ). 

I'm 25 and I work in the IT field. I currently make $75,000  yearly. At my previous employer my salary was $55,000 yearly and I was employed there for 1 year. I've never been employed at a job more than 2 years. My industry is pretty quick changing as roles open and close and technology changes.

I understand that an employer contributing 4% is great but if it takes 5 years to see it all, whats the point ? Who's to say I won't receive another job offer in 2024 for a $20,000 raise in salary ?

You receive a raise faster from changing employer than waiting years to own what your employer contributes....so what's the point ?

I currently bank with a local Credit Union and have $60,000 saved, when checking my account I noticed that I've been receiving $7 in "" dividends ""  monthly for a while. I would imagine this is the interest rate you receive based on your savings amount. I've looked online at other banks and some have as high as 4% APY regarding saving interest. 

So if I switch to that bank, I would earn $2,400 a year on 60k, or am I doing the math wrong ? If so, that is a drastic difference from earning $7 a month and I would contemplate switching to a bank with a higher rate.

10k1dim,SilverSquare,"Filling out W-4, I got three jobs with this third one being a paid volunteer gig. Confused on ""Extra withholding"".

Hi! So I am currently filling out a W-4 for my third job and I am a bit confused. 

So I have two jobs and I got this third one that I am filling out the W-4 for (Don't worry, it's just a full-time, a part-time, and this is a paid volunteer-based gig). Anyway, I did the Multiple Jobs Worksheet.

- My main job is salaried. 40 hours/week paid bi-weekly.
- My part-time job is part-time, 9 hours/week paid bi-weekly.
- This third paid volunteer position is where you sign up for shifts. It's variable hours depending on if I want to work a shift or not. There can be a chance that I don't even work for this gig for a month. I don't expect heavy hours. I don't know if this is biweekly/monthly pay.

***(c) Extra withholding. Enter any additional tax you want withheld each pay period . .*** 

After doing the Multiple Jobs Worksheet, I've got $143 for my Extra withholding for Step 4c. It doesn't seem correct because I know I won't be earning that much from my paycheck especially since I anticipate light hours like 3-4 hrs a shift if I was free and willing to do the shift.

I'm lost in what this all means since I'm not well-versed in these things. My brain says they'll deduct $143 each paycheck no matter what (I don't know if my pay is biweekly/weekly since I haven't volunteered yet. It just feels like I won't get paid at all due to this withholding.)

I wanted to play it safe and ask before I submit this form. I was wondering if someone could help explain if this is correct, and if so will $143 be deducted from each paycheck (ergo no pay for me unless if I earn more than $143 per two weeks) or am I thinking things in the wrong direction?",No,Yes,No,Yes,Yes

The flowchart and asking around has been very helpful with managing my finances better, however I realized through my research that Iâ€™m saving up for old age, an age that I may not reach.

I have type-2 diabetes, ADHD, depression, and anxiety. I take meds for these constantly and Iâ€™m on a PPO (heard this was better for me versus HDHP HSAs)

Started to manage finances better during the pandemic:

- Maxed out my Roth IRAs so far (taking it slow this year instead of lump summing); retirement fund (target 2060 index fund)

- Matched workâ€™s contributions to 401k (started job last year); auto investing in a retirement fund (either 2050-2060)

- Brokerage, rarely contribute to this (investing only in Schwab Total Stock Market)

- Currently my strategy with my income is mostly budgeting my paycheck. Put $1300k in an Ally HYSA every month for â€œrentâ€ and $500 auto deposited to an emergency fund every month. Itâ€™s really where most of my non-spending money goes since I still feel new with investing.

Before I dive deeper and do things like max my 401K or do bonds, investing more, etc. I wanted to ask **what is your opinion on how to approach finances with a chronic illness?**

I have no idea how modern medicine will be in the future. I have no idea if a cure for diabetes will happen in my lifetime.

For the past couple of months, I've been learning about personal finances and have done a decent job at budgeting. Now, I feel like is a good time to take the next step and get a credit card since I've been using my debit this entire time.

I'm 27 in California. Chase is my current main bank. Regrettably never had a credit card. I've been with my bank since February escaping a previous bad situation with a different bank (long story short, had a joint account with my father and he stole money, so I'm in the process of closing that account.)

I want this card so that I can start building credit. I've also heard it's safer to use your credit card online versus a debit card as you're covered more. Though, I got some questions I wanted to ask.

1. **Am I able to get a credit card online/phone instead of in-person?** I'm not in a safe position to leave the house as much due to my family and I being in a high risk category for COVID.

2. ""Total Annual Gross Income"" is a question I see on Chase's ""get a decision in seconds"" application. I've been furloughed and then eventually forced to resign (due to me rejecting hours in fear of COVID.). I worked at this job from November up to last week. I've been currently collecting Unemployment since March/April. **How do I calculate what my gross income is? Do I calculate my time from Nov-March? Do I calculate my Unemployment? Do I even have a ""Total Annual Gross Income"" since I was forced to resign and I'm no longer working?**

3. **Are my chances of getting a credit card through Chase pretty good since that's my current bank?** I've looked into this and IIRC that if I didn't sign up during my time in college where it was easier, that I'd most likely have to look into a secured credit card. **Would my short, but current time in Chase along with money I've been saving up help me out?**

Hi everyone. 28 year old, late-bloomer, from California looking to invest in my future. Got a 6-month emergency savings fund of $9000, currently not at a full time so no 401k. So my next goal is Roth IRA. Tried to do research and look at the wiki, but I have some simple newbie questions since I have trouble understanding them.

1. **Was transferring $6000 from my bank to my Roth Contributory IRA (for the 2020 year) just as simple as that in terms of ""contributing"" to my IRA?** At least for the bare minimum? Theoretically, can I just do that and leave it be for the bare minimum or is there more action I need to take?

2. **Why do I have a Roth Contributory IRA instead of a regular Roth IRA?** I signed up on Schwab with the intention of a Roth IRA. Is it the same or are they different?

2. I already transferred the money. It's tradeable. **If I choose to trade, Do I have until the tax deadline May 17th to trade or do I have a lot of time since my money is already there?**

3. **As someone who is still new to this, what are possible options?** A friend and online research seem to recommend to put it all on Index Funds. I used Schwab. Would the S&amp;P 500 or Schwab Total Stock Market Index FundÂ® be things I should be eyeing?

4. **Do I put all $6000 on an Index Fund?** Or should I just consider putting a partial amount?

5. **Once May 17th passes. Can I withdraw the 6000 I contributed to the 2020 year any time I want?** I know I can withdraw what I contributed without penalty as long as it's not earnings.

Was I lucky? I'm not a college student anymore. Never had any loans, student debt thanks to financial aid. Nothing I've done for me to expect me to have a score (if any at all) that'll get me accepted.

I had a linked debit card with my Dad at another bank that I've had since college. Then things happened (he took money from my account without asking, caused overdrafts, etc.) and in 2020 I changed to Chase where I've maintained a checking account. Currently around 15k. Just became frugal with my only ""big"" transaction being a transfer to my brokerage for my Roth IRA.

I don't know if I was just lucky or if Chase saw that I maintained a high balance for over a year. Still just a little worried since I know many people got rejected by Chase for their first credit card. My parents weren't the best at money. Back then, Mom didn't understand credit cards and would spend a lot. My dad wasn't any better. I have reason to believe they might've opened a card under my grandpa's name (consensually, but still not responsible). I'm just afraid with their past history of not being good with money that they might've opened something under my name without me knowing?

**tl;dr:**

* **I'm happy to get my first credit card with Chase! Is there a way to check my credit score to make sure my parent's bad financial history didn't affect me? (ex. Didn't open a credit line under my name or something..)**

* **I know there's three companies (Equifax, etc.) that can check. From my understanding, I get one free check from each for a year. I'd rather not ""waste"" it incase I should wait for like the end of the year. What do you recommend the strategy is?**

* **Was I lucky to get a Chase Credit Card as my first card? 28. I assumed I didn't have a credit score or a ""default score"". I don't have anything like loans or debt that I can think of. Even at a credit limit of $1500, I feel very lucky.**",,,,,

Hi y'all! I feel like I've learned so much about credit and investments thanks to you all at /r/personalfinance + the wiki as well as speaking with a financial consultant friend who gave some advice. So far I think I feel like I'm definitely making a lot of improvements on my finances and would love to see if you guys can evaluate my strategy. All in all, I want financial independence, use my finances efficiently, and help my money grow.

**Little about my finances:** No full-time job, just a part-time, but currently looking for a full-time role. No 401K/HSA. 28 years old. Expenses are low since I live at home. I have a frugal state of mind, but I haven't been efficient until this year. Just invested in my Roth IRA this year! I also JUST got my first credit card at 28. Hoping to move out within a couple of years, however, CA is expensive.

I have around 20K right now in my checking at Chase. I have a Roth IRA/Individual Brokerage at Schwab. I maxed out my Roth IRA for 2020. I invested my Roth IRA 2020 contributions to a Target Date 2060 fund (SWYNX). Hoping to contribute to my 2021 later this year.

1. **Capping** my Chase Checking Account at around **$3000**. Anything above that gets deposited to the High Yield Savings Account or on an index fund.

2. **Build my credit** by using my Chase Freedom Unlimited Card by using it and paying it off. Only utilizing 30% of my credit.

2. Open a **High Yield Savings Account** at Ally. Deposit my Emergency Savings + other things like an overseas vacation trip, etc.

3. **Invest surplus money** on my **individual taxable brokerage account** on an index fund. Total Market Market Index Fund (SWTSX) is what I'm thinking so far. Currently want to have a ""set it and forget it"" deal like I do with my Roth IRA. Would love to invest in stocks in the future, but until I get more comfortable.

---

I am open to the idea of looking into diversifying in the future (real estate, stocks, bonds, etc.) but I feel like I need to be more comfortable learning about these things which is why I'm thinking about playing it safe for now. For example, I'm still not sure if the SWTSX is better or do S&amp;P 500, haha.

Is $3000 a good cap to have for my checking or should I make it higher?

Is there a more efficient way to go around this or is my strategy good so far?",,,,,
nw01zp,SilverSquare,"I want to deposit around $4000-$5000 dollars in cash, what do I need to know ahead of time?

Hi, I have 4000-5000 in cash. About 70% of that was cash I had stashed for a Japan trip pre-pandemic. 30% is general savings from gifts, allowance or whatever. The Japan trip stash was from withdrawing it and putting it aside my paychecks pre-pandemic (laid of due to COVID from that previous job). General savings is self-explanatory.

Why do I have it in cash? One, had an incident where I had a shared checking account with my Dad (US Bank) and he took money, so I panic withdrew and kept my money. I switched to a different bank (Chase), but this was right before the pandemic, so I didn't have the opportunity to deposit.

Two, I just didn't know better. Learned about how to handle my finances better and now know it's better to keep it at a bank, high yield savings account, investments/retirement, etc. instead of letting it collect dust.

I know traveling around with a lot of cash on me is a big risk. I'm definitely gonna err on the side of safety. But in terms of legal stuff, is there anything I need ahead of time? I never deposited through a teller. Always through ATMs. 

**Do I need my ID/SSN/Debit Card on hand? Do I need to fill out any forms? Have past paystubs?**

**Do I need to be ready to tell them my reasoning? Is it as simple as going through a teller, pulling up a lot of cash and that's it?** 

I guess a part of me is worried about raising a red flag or going through a lengthy paperwork process since I've looked into large deposits and know there's a report for $10K every year or something. I know I'm probably overthinking things since it's just $4-5K. I don't have anything to hide, however, I just want to know what to expect so I can be ready for what they want from me.",,,,,
owsc1y,SilverSquare,"Clarification about Credit Utilization

Hi guys, recently got a credit card a few months ago and am curious about credit utilization. To my understanding, you donâ€™t use your entire credit line if you want to increase your score. My credit line is $1500, so $450 is what I should aim for.

Question is, what if I spent like $200 on the first week, paid it off and spend $300 more by my third week. 

It would mean I spent $500 total. Would my credit utilization still remain under 30% since I paid off the $200? Thus meaning it goes back to 0% until I paid more?

Iâ€™ve been charging stuff on my credit card these days because I heard itâ€™s safer as well as just racking up reward points.

Iâ€™d like to say Iâ€™m responsible with my money, so Iâ€™m just worried about my credit score which dropped down by 5 points without any late payments. 702 to 697.",,,,,
r03dte,SilverSquare,"What would be better? A PPO w/ Anthem or an HDHP PPO w/ Anthem?

It's open enrollment. I'm switching away from a HMO with Kaiser. I currently have a PPO set, but heard HDHP is better? I'm from the Bay Area.

tl;dr: I'm leaving my HMO because I have a suspicion that I have ADHD. No matter if it's ADHD or something different, I don't want to risk dealing with mental health issues since I heard Kaiser's Mental Health system is a nightmare. 

Currently, I have my enrollment switching to Anthem PPO which will be $100 versus Kaiser HMO's $29. I have the opportunity to do Anthem's HDP which is a lower premium, but higher deductable. But with this, I have the opportunity to have an HSA which I heard good things about here.

Which one would be better? Hypothetically, I go through the process of getting a diagnosis and then start on medication. Which would be the better financial position in the long run?",,,,,
r1h7zw,SilverSquare,"Can I make purchases over my credit limit? I can pay it immediately.

So pretty much, I'm thinking about getting a new computer for Black Friday. So far I'm looking at the $2k-$4k range. The thing is my Credit Card with Chase has a $1.5k limit. I have the means to pay it. I can even pay it off immediately. Would there be a problem? I'd love to pay with my credit card to get rewards points. Worst case scenario, would I have to just pay with my Debit Card?",,,,,
