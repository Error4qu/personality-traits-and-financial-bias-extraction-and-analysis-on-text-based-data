ivmifs,jeepluv1,"Retired mom might get a divorce and taking on mortgage in hcol area. What to do?

So my dad is suddenly up and leaving the country for another by himself. He asked my mom to come with him but she declined because she wants to stay in the US to look after her grown up kids and see her grandkids grow up. So my dad suddenly announced he's leaving this coming week without a forewarning at all. He's introverted, quiet, and has never gotten very close the almost 40 yrs I've known him. My parents have been together about 50 yrs. We're all very hurt right now and worried about my mom. She's retired with just a social security check of $1000 a month. We live in suburban DC which is costly enough as it is. Rent for a 1 or 2 bedroom runs upwards of the same price as a mortgage payment could be. My parents bought this older home 15 yrs ago for 350,000. My dad has never managed his money well and has always used credit cards and has always been in debt besides earning a salary of 150k and upwards sometimes. My mom had been content with her 15/hour job for her whole life. So my parents aren't the smartest at money or finances. I'm barely learning myself in my 30's. My dad took out the equity of the house some years ago about 30k and has paid the bare minimum towards the house. The amount owed now is 370k. The houses around us are selling for 500k. Here is the link to zillow and selling within a day or 2 like hotcakes. We live in a hot area where govt agencies and companies are opening up every month. It's rapidly changing and becoming a hot area to live in.

I am thinking of spending a little to remodel the basement to rent it out and possibly convert a carport into a room for someone to live in. I've looked at how much rent for a room with a bathroom is going in the area and it's $900-1200. I would live with my mom and contribute. I have never rented out a room before or been a landlord however. What to do at this point? My mom would like to keep the house and dad has left us dangling on wether he'd actually come back or not but at this point he said he's done with paying the house and will only help pay until november. What to do at this point? Rent for a 1 bedroom 1 bathroom runs 1700-2200 for rent not including utilities. The mortgage payment right now is 2200 not including utilities. Oh and moving out of the area is out of the question. She'd have to move out 4 hours away to the boonies if she wants to get something affordable for her social security check.",Yes,Yes,No,Yes,Yes

I work in IA right now making 65k at 39 in DC. Way low I know! But I was making just 32k last year. My dad is leaving my mom out of the blue and announced he's leaving the country in a few days and my retired mom is being left with a costly mortgage but considering the area the rent of an apartment is about the same as the cost of the mortgage. I'm planning to help with some of the rent of the $2200 a month and the utilities run an extra $900 a month according to my mom. I want to learn something on the side to increase my income.

I want to use the extra time to increase my pay and I'm eyeing commission based jobs that could make thousands or work at home jobs in the DC area.

kyb9nk,jeepluv1,"Keep house or sell in an demand area?

# My parents own a house that they purchased for 350k back in 2004. My dad is the most introverted man and my mother doesn't understand finances or anything of the like and was content working a job that paid her 15/hour for most of her life. My dad made 6 figures but he retired. He now wants to leave and retire in another country and maybe come back to the US in a state that is much cheaper with a lower COL. He wants to abandon the family and my mom. My mom wants to keep the house because she loves it despite it being older (built in the 1960's but all houses in the DC area are old) and needing repairs and updates throughout the house. The house was bought for 350k and we currently owe 350k still because my dad had only been paying the minimum because he has always been horrible at money management and used his credit cards for everything and he never discussed how he could pay off the house with my mom or anyone else. He also had taken out equity to pay off some of his debts and his old ugly car. He took us by surprise during corona year and told us he was leaving and retiring in another country. He tells us now it's up to us to pay the bills and he will only help with 1k. I intended to rent elsewhere but the house is in a desireable area with a lot of government people and students nearby who travel up to 2 hours or a state away sometimes to come and work here. I am unsure if we should remodel or fix up the basement or turn the carport into a room or add a shed and convert it to a separate area in the back to rent as a room. The thing is my mom doesn't want to share the house during corona so whichever person we could rent to has to live seperately. My mom currently only receives 1k a month through ss which isn't enough to cover much. My brother also moved back because he just went through a divorce. We are both trying to help but at this point I don't know what to do. Support my mom in keeping the house and trying to pay off the house or keep saving to buy a bigger house since this one is just 1300 square feet or so. However the location is great and close to everything and this area is just too expensive but our jobs are here. What to do?

So I am over 35 but just got my DL from a driving school that didn't teach me parking. It was an adult waiver course and they tried to milk more hours but gave me a DL anyway.

I have a very old very old fashioned and has battery issues impala that is owned by my mom who is asking me to buy a new car. Not used but new.

13e1mak,JMRooDukes808,"If you expect to make more than the Roth IRA income limits in the future, should you avoid rolling over a 401k to a tIRA?

This question is purely hypothetical since I still make well below the income limits after maxing my 401k. However, I expect my income (or HHI) to eventually exceed the limit.

When looking at a back door Roth IRA as an option, it seems simple enough to contribute to a tIRA then immediately convert to Roth, but the â€œpro-rataâ€ rule is where I get confused. It seems like you should only do a back door Roth if you donâ€™t already have money in a tIRA in order to avoid a larger tax bill, so does that mean if I left my current job it would be advised to keep my 401k as it is (or roll to new 401k) vs converting to a tIRA?

13vp4zm,JMRooDukes808,"Wedding vendor accidentally charged me $13k and maxed out my card. Can I do anything about it today?

This is for a Capital One Venture card.So my wedding is this weekend and I had to make the last payment for catering. I filled out a CC authorization form last week and told them they could charge my card on the 29th for about $6400 when it was due. I woke up this morning to an email saying there was an â€œerror in their point of sale system and you might see a pending transaction that will be dropped after midnight tonight. We were able to immediately void the transaction, etc etcâ€ 

Well that pending charge is for $12,800 in addition to the correct $6400 charge, so now the card is maxed out. I suspect I wonâ€™t be able to use it until at least Thursday when the pending transactions clear. If I call Capital One to explain the situation, will they be able to remove the pending charge early?

Edit: sounds like Iâ€™m SOL

Edit: this question is solely around the credit card limit. Advice about not financing your wedding on a credit card is not welcome because that is not the situation. No I do not have another credit card to use. Yes I can use cash or debit, but again thatâ€™s not the question.

Edit: thank you to everyone who offered advice. I called capital one today and spoke to 4 different people after the charge was still there this morning. Even though I have a receipt for the voided transaction from the vendor, they were unable to 1) give me a permanent credit line increase, 2) give me a temporary credit line increase, 3) mark the transaction as fraud or disputed, or 4) give me the credit back for the charge before it gets dropped off. I also made a $5000+ payment this morning, but because the charge put me so far above my limit, I only got $147 in available credit back. 

I also applied for a chase card last night and that is pending review so there is literally nothing that can be done today by capital one, the vendor, or myself. 

All in all, I am going to be downgrading my venture card to the free version and no longer using Capital One. In the ONE instance I needed them, they were absolutely useless from every angle.",No,Yes,Yes,No,Yes

15k03es,JMRooDukes808,"How important is it to pay off debt before buying first home?

My wife and I (ages 28 and 29) just got married this year and Iâ€™m mapping out our 2024 expected income/budget/expenses and our debt. Our HHI is roughly $200k depending on commissions (both of us are in commission jobs but I have a pretty high base + guaranteed commission).

Our biggest goal is to save for our first house, probably to be purchased in 3-4 years as weâ€™re moving to a new city at the end of this year, and plan on renting there for max 2 years while we figure out where we want to live long term. 

My initial thought was to pay off all our debts before we buy the home if possible, which Iâ€™m confident we can do but the question is really how important is debt to income ratio when buying your first home? 

I have $13k in student loans (avg 3.97%), and my wife has $30k in student loans roughly the same interest rate. The total amount is spread across about 15 loans. 

Which brings me to the ultimate question - would it be better to pay off the student loans aggressively before saving up a down payment? I know that the general consensus is that loans under 4% can be paid off over time since you can get better returns in the market, but thatâ€™s not really our goal in the short term because we will already be saving about $40k in retirement funds per year.",No,Yes,No,No,No

One of them has 0% APR right now so what happens if I donâ€™t pay off the full balance? Does it just not accrue any interest and I take a temporary hit to my credit score? It would only be a small balance left and I would pay it off in full in 2 weeks.",No,Yes,No,No,Yes
ev0sd6,JMRooDukes808,"Is it possible to pay your credit card bill too often?

Iâ€™m a 25yo male and have never had a credit card. My income is about $78k/year and I am good at tracking all of my expenses. I have a spreadsheet where I track my biweekly income, payments that I have to make towards bills, rent, insurance, student loans, etc. and I also contribute 10% of my income to my 401k and am building up my emergency fund. I think itâ€™s time for me to get a credit card to take advantage of the miles/points that I can get with my spending, in addition to building my credit history beyond just my student loans. 

Outside of the essential payments, I spend about $600-$700 every 2 weeks on what I consider â€œflexâ€ spending - groceries, gas, eating out, bars, concert tickets, basically anything that is not rent or a bill.

When considering a credit card, I know that I must pay it off every single month in full and never have a balance, which I plan on doing. My question is - can (or should) I pay off my credit card balance every 2 weeks instead of every month? I think this would be easier for me based on how I track my expenses (per pay period vs per month). I would rather pay off what I just spent over the previous 2 weeks instead of waiting for a full month to pass before paying it off.

What are the pros/cons to this? Iâ€™m currently reading â€œI Will Teach You To Be Richâ€ and I know the basic steps of personal finance (emergency fund, maximizing 401k employer match, paying down debts, etc.) but some of the terminology can just be overwhelming and difficult for me to fully understand.

So the general recommendation is to contribute 15% of your income to retirement...is that before or after taxes, or some combination?

I can also contribute to my Roth IRA (lets say $100/month), and while Iâ€™m paying off my student loans that amounts to about 3% of my post-tax income. So would that be considered 12% of my income?

gd0loq,JMRooDukes808,"When should my gf refinance her car loan?

So my girlfriend bought a 2014 Honda CRV back in November 2019 for about $14000. At the time, she didnâ€™t have an extensive credit history at all, and it was mainly student loans and one Target CC that she closed shortly after opening because we realized it was a mistake to have that card (although she cancelled before we realized she shouldâ€™ve just kept it open and not used it). 

Because of this, her interest rate is something ridiculous like 11%. The dealership said it was the best they could do with her limited history, and said she should look to refinance after 6 months or so when she builds some credit history. Personally I think she should refinance ASAP but we have never refinanced anything so we donâ€™t even know the process. She says she wants to wait a full year of making payments to boost her credit and then refinance.

gg2b97,JMRooDukes808,"Why savings goals are important and my personal finance journey

Iâ€™ll start by saying I know none of you care about these details at all, but I the reason I started making personal finance a hobby revolves around a goal I never had before and turned into something beautiful. If it can help just one person on this sub, it wasnâ€™t a waste of time.

Iâ€™m a 25 year old male who graduated in December of 2017 with a degree in Energy. Landed a job in tech sales as an SDR out of college, making my degree basically worthless, and making roughly $55k/year in a HCOL area (northern Virginia). 

When I graduated and started making money, I never had a second thought about my finances because I knew I could easily afford all my bills every month and thought that was all thatâ€™s important. That was until July 2018 when my favorite DJ announced a destination music festival in Mexico that I knew I couldnâ€™t miss, happening in Feb/Mar â€˜19 and would cost about $5000 total between me and my gf. 

This caused me to manually build a spreadsheet mapping out my projected income and expenses for the next 6 months since I was paying for the trip on a payment plan to see if I could really afford it. Even though my gf and I really struggled by not being able to go to bars and shows like normal, this ended up being a huge blessing since it was the first step in the prime directive before I ever knew about this sub or anything related to PF. 

From there, I realized how important it was to always have specific goals in mind when dealing with money. Even if itâ€™s retirement thatâ€™s 40 years from now, the time to plan is now. Every dollar you get, PAY YOURSELF FIRST. Without this random music festival popping up in my life and forcing me to take a deep dive into my finances, I never would be where I am today with a solid e-fund, plans to pay off $20k in student loans by the end of 2021, and retirement/wedding/house goals in mind.

Hi everyone,

I just got my Q4 sales commission check and with my upcoming tax return Iâ€™m finally in a position to open a brokerage account after maxing out my IRA.

Yes, there is a guaranteed return of 4.66% by paying the loans, but if Iâ€™m scheduled to pay them off in 10 years just by paying the minimum, wouldnâ€™t it make more sense to fund my IRA first because of how much more time it will have to grow?

Reasons why I am not a fan of 401kâ€™s.

1. It is locked in till 59.5 and if you need money for an important event such as a downpayment for a house or need capital to start a 99.1% pure meth business but most of your money is parked in a 401k, get ready to lose hella cash and taxes pretty much instantaneously. Not fun. 

2. Vested time. Some companies have a vested time period where the â€œfree moneyâ€ isnâ€™t actually yours till a certain number of years. What if you leave the company or are laid off. Well there goes your â€œfree moneyâ€ guys. No such thing as a free lunch. 

3. Hidden maintenance fees that are not really visible to you unless you go looking for it. Trust me, Iâ€™ve done it myself. 

4. If you pull out money from 401k after 59.5, yes you will not pay a penalty anymore BUT if you are in a higher tax bracket than you thought youâ€™d be, then you will be paying hella taxes anyways with potentially measly returns on top of that. 

5. Flexibility in investments is important to me. I should be free to invest any stock, index fund, or etf I want. What if I donâ€™t like the target date funds or the mutual funds provided? Why should I be forced to invest in something I am not comfortable with?

lm9go6,Jumbo86,"Invest in dividend paying stocks now, knowing â€œinvestable moneyâ€ is going to decrease in the near future?

My wife and I are in our early 30s with a baby and another on the way.  We have no debt outside of our mortgage and have healthy retirement savings.  Combined income of approximately $140k.  We have been fortunate to have gotten free childcare from relatives during Covid.  Two kids will be entering daycare in late 2020/early 2021 however and we are likely to have a 3rd kid in the not too distant future.  

We basically keep $10k in checking and $15k in savings, moving the excess to our investment account when appropriate.  Additionally, we have things set up to auto transfer $150 to the investment account every two weeks on payday.  

So far we have about $20,000 in stocks and have done pretty well.  Trying to get stocks with some growth potential, which also pay a solid dividend (trying to average 4-5% altogether).  

Anyways, my basic plan is to try to get like $50,000 in dividend paying stocks, knowing that I will have less money available to invest for the foreseeable future, at least until I am done paying for daycare.  $50k in stocks at 5% yield pays out $208 per month.  That way even if itâ€™s just $150 every two weeks that I can afford to invest going forward, I will still average adding $500+ per month into the stock account and will have that to play with.  

My plan make sense to you guys?  Any advice?",Yes,Yes,No,No,No

We bought a house for $425k 2 years ago that is now worth $525k+.  I have $122,000 in my 401k, wife has a good pension.  I contribute 20% of salary to 401k including match.

I am 34 and married.  Combined we make $140k.  We have a 1 year old entering daycare and another kid on the way.  Daycare is $1000+ per kid, if you are unaware.  

We currently take $100/week out of our paycheck to invest in stocks.  Realistically, we wonâ€™t increase this for at least 5 years, with daycare costing what it does.  Itâ€™s possible we will have to reduce it.  

I have approximately $28k across about a dozen stocks at the moment.  All pay at least a 3% dividend and IMO have limited downside in the long term.  Dividends pay me about $1375 per year at this point.  

My thought process is, these dividend payments will keep money flowing into my brokerage account and allow me to keep reinforcing my existing positions and opening new ones without having to sell off any positions.

Hi, everyone.

I'm sitting here tonight, a little less than halfway through the education portion of studying for my CFP. Taking a night off, but finance and planning are still on my mind. And I was wondering why more people don't take advantage of in-service 401k rollovers to get around the annual Roth IRA contribution limits. Assuming they're eligible for Roth contributions, of course. 

You can only contribute $6,000 per year if you're under 50, but if you're able to shove $19,000 into your 401k every year you can rollover that over and end up with more than $6,000 in your Roth every year. It obviously depends on your tax bracket, but you've already paid OASDI and Medicare taxes on your 401k contributions, so all you'd owe is federal and state taxes. Combined, you'd have to have an effective tax rate of something like 73% to get you all the way down to $6,000 from $19,000 plus employer match. 

Why don't people do this? Even if you paid 35% in federal and state taxes, you'd still end up with something like $14,500 in your Roth IRA every year, more than double what you'd be able to contribute otherwise.",Yes,Yes,No,No,No
g4abi7,Just-A-Random-Guy-92,"Confidence as a Financial Advisor

Hi, everyone. I just had a quick question for anyone here who who's a financial advisor and/or CFPÂ® Professional.

I am currently 27 years old (28 next month) and I graduated from college in 2014 with a BS degree. I worked in pharmacy for four years, three years in retail and one year in inpatient, and in 2019, for reasons I won't go into, I lost my job at the hospital. At that point I decided I wanted to move on to something new, different, and hopefully better.

I had been managing my own finances for a few years at that  point. I'd been in the market for two years. I would always talk to coworkers about stocks and the market, etc. and they would encourage me to pursue a career in the industry.

Well, I got that chance in 2019. I was hired last March to work at a small RIA. And when I say small, I mean small. It's just me and my boss, with 20 clients or so and AUM of $10M. I started off doing mostly back office work, but have met all our clients face to face and essentially act as a client liaison. I suppose some people would call me a relationship manager...

Anyway, I passed my series 65 in October of 2019 and am now studying for my CFP. I am pushing through the Kaplan coursework at a good pace and I am excited at the prospects of earning the marks, increasing my knowledge, increasing my earning power, etc. But it is a lot of information and sometimes I'm not confident I'll be able to retain it all.

I envision myself, in the future, working for a larger RIA with hundreds of millions or billions under management, or even working on my own and building my own practice. And I guess my question is this...

How long did it take you to feel comfortable and confident as a senior advisor or equivalent? As someone in charge who was actually planning, analyzing, and making calls for clients? I'm a career changer, only been around for a year or so. I love learning and helping others learn about their finances, but I'm not confident I could sit down with a client and assess their insurance needs and their ISOs or NQSOs and tell them all about how different types of charitable donations are taxed without having to reference my book.

I imagine that if I'm brought on I will be working in somewhat of a hybrid capacity, helping with both administrative duties and financial planning, at least in the background. Essentially, I expect to be a paraplanner. That's basically what I am now, but I am making state minimum wage ($13/hr) and I was told I would likely start out making at least 50% more if I switched jobs.

gina4s,Just-A-Random-Guy-92,"I Have A New Job Offer

Hi, everyone. I am going for an interview tomorrow! I do currently have a job. However, it is in an entry level position and pays minimum wage ($13 per hour) in a high cost of living area. I am college-edicated, have earned an important certification since I began working at my current job fourteen months ago and I am actively pursuing another highly regarded industry certification.

I have my hands in a little of everything, given that the company is just my boss and me (a small LLC). But most of my duties are administrative. Billing, invoicing, filing, etc. But I also create documents for clients, collect data, onboard them, send them forms they need, sit in on meetings and record the minutes, troubleshoot technology issues, help to ensure compliance, etc. Needless to say, my knowledge in the field is rapidly growing. 

I am already grossly underpaid, but when I was hired I really needed the money, so I took what I could get (I also came from a completely different industry and thus had no experience a year ago). 

The new job says starting salary is $40,000-45,000, equivalent to $19.23 to $21.63 per hour. But the person I've been in contact with says I will likely start closer to the $15-16 per hour range and be rapidly promoted to closer to $20 after an as yet undetermined probationary period, although an official offer has not been made. The average salary for an administrative assistant in my area ranges from about $39,000-$48,000. My title at the new company would be something like Client Services Administrator. I feel that with my additional knowledge above and beyond the basics of office administration, I should be paid more.

My question is this: Given the fact that I am only making $13 per hour currently, how hard should I negotiate for a higher salary right off the bat? Should I take the likely initial $15-16 per hour and be happy when I get $19 or $20 per hour in a few months? Or should I go in and tell them the average salary of administrative assistants in the area and hope they at least meet that upfront? I don't think I'd be greedy asking for $19.25 per hour ($40,000) upfront, but I also don't want to turn them off. I've never been in a position to negotiate before and I feel like I have some leverage because the offer to interview came completely unsolicited.",Yes,Yes,No,Yes,Yes

Hey, guys and gals. I am a 28 year old career changer. I worked three years in retail pharmacy, one year in inpatient pharmacy, and switched careers last March (in 2019) to work for a small Registered Investment Advisor (RIA). I have a Bachelor Degree from Penn State and passed my Series 65 in October 2019. I am now also more than halfway through the education requirement for the CFPÂ® marks.

An outside firm has expressed interest in hiring me for more than I'm making now. After doing some research, it appears that they posted an ad for a Client Services Associate a few months ago. Job duties and qualifications include:

- Associate Degree Preferred
- One Year of Relevant Work Experience Preferred
- One Year of Customer Service Experience Preferred
- Knowledge of Basic Bookkeeping
- Coordination, Preparation, and Submission of Account Applications
- Preparation, Creation, and Maintenance of Excel Spreadsheets
- Answering Phone Calls
- Assistance in Back Office Work (Filing, Setting Appointments, Updating the Website, Client Billing, Payroll, Accounts Receivable, Ordering Supplies, etc.)
- Knowledge of Microsoft Office Suite and Ability to Learn Financial Industry Software Quickly

The salary was listed as $40,000 to $45,000

However, I feel I am worth more than this. I easily meet the degree requirement, and I have the experience they ask for (one year industry and one year customer service). And with the exception of updating the website, I already engage in all the listed duties at my current place of work. I also have my Series 65 and am well on my way to earning my CFPÂ® marks. This is well above the required qualifications and they have expressed excitement at the prospect of bringing in a young person who has long term ambitions in the industry (as opposed to the woman they have working there now, who has a degree in computer science and has no plans to ever become a financial advisor).

The liaison I've been speaking to has said that I will likely start at about $31,200 to $33,280, to be increased to closer to $41,600 after a few weeks or months of a preliminary probation period. Starting that low is almost insulting. And even though I am working for less than that now, circumstances were very different when I was hired at my current employer.

Given my credentials, my potential, my experience, the salary listed in their ad, and the fact that straight administrative assistant jobs start at $38,000 in my area (at the bare minimum), should I ask for what I want?

gmohxg,Just-A-Random-Guy-92,"Invest or Pay Off Debt?

I will be starting a new job soon that has great growth prospects and will pay much better than the job I will continue with until the end of June (due to my employer having received a payroll protection loan).

From what I've been told, there will be a probationary period where I will be making $16 an hour. This is in contrast to what I'm making now ($13 an hour, minimum wage in my county). This means that I will start out making $250 more per month after taxes. And it would be more than that, but I am electing additional withholding due to the fact that I did a Roth conversion earlier this year and I'm not making estimated tax payments 

After the probationary period, I could be making $18-20. And, yes, I will be sure to get that in writing. But I've been told by other employees that the boss is very good about regular raises. If I make $18 an hour, that would give me $720 more per month after taxes, including additional withholding. If I make $20 an hour, that would give me $875 more after taxes, including additional withholding. This also takes into account the extra I'll have to pay on student loans and health insurance (REPAYE and subsidized health insurance through the state marketplace), a slightly increased food budget, and the fact that by the time I'm making $18-20 an hour, I should no longer be paying for my courses ($680 per course, each one taking me about a month to complete). 

I'm 28, with $22,000 in my Roth. I have $35,000 in student loans at 5.62% and a $16,200 auto loan at 5.94%.

If I put all the extra money toward my auto loan I could pay it off by the end of 2021 or early 2022. I would then roll the free cash from not making auto payments into student loan payments. And even with the increased balance from interest accrual, I could pay them all off in three to four years. Then the only debt I'd have is the mortgage or rent I take on (I don't currently pay for housing). I understand rent isn't debt, but you know what I mean... 

All this being said, I used to absolutely shovel cash into my Roth and haven't been doing so for the past year or so due to the fact that my online classes take up a majority of my discretionary income. I'm young and I really want to take advantage of time being on my side, compound growth and all. But paying off my car and student loans would free up a a few hundred bucks a month at least, and I should be making even more than $20 and hour in a few years (hopefully closer to $25). Although, I do hope to eventually start my own business and those usually aren't profitable for at least a few years. So we'll see how that goes.

Anyway, it seems like now could be a good time to really start focusing on paying down debt. What would you do in my shoes? Pay down the debt? Invest and hope I can get a higher return than my interest rate on the debt? Or perhaps split my extra earned income between the two?",Yes,Yes,No,No,No
go9pco,Just-A-Random-Guy-92,"Advance Premium Tax Credit

I have subsidized health insurance. For the first few months of the year, I underestimated my income for the year. This is because I completed a $4,000 Roth conversion at the beginning of March. That obviously counts as income. I increased my estimated income by the $4,000 and that decreased the subsidy I get each month, but the underpayment (or over-subsidization) for January and February will need to be repaid come tax time next year.

Now, I'm likely getting a new job at the end of June or beginning of July. I'll be getting a substantial raise. Starting at 23% more than I'm making now and possibly making 54% more by the end of the year after a probationary period.

This change in income will substantially decrease the monthly subsidy I get. And if you take all the income from the job I have now, the job I'll have in a month or so, and my Roth conversion, I'd need to start paying thr full cost of my insurance starting in June to avoid total underpayment for the year. I'd like to avoid having to pay that next April.

However I can't go in and delete my current job and add my next job yet. That just screws with things. So what should I do? Should I just withhold more in taxes? Seems like an obvious answer, but I'm looking for guidance. Thanks!",No,Yes,No,No,Yes
gpeohp,Just-A-Random-Guy-92,"Lifestyle Drift

I am starting to be (or will soon be) doing a little better financially. My stimulus check really helped bolster my bank account and my expenses have gone down since everything has been shut down (whether you think the shutdown is a good or bad thing should be reserved for another reddit post).

On top of that, not only am I still working and earning income... I will be getting a new job at the end of June or the beginning of July that will pay me at least 15% more than I'm currently making. There is also the opportunity for extremely rapid raises (I could be making 54% more than my current wages by the end of the year). Obviously, it's not smart to act as if I'm making 54% more until I actually am. But my point is that I'll be making significantly more than I am now very soon. This is all in addition to 14 days of unused vacation that will be paid out to me when I leave my current employer. That will likely all go to savings. 

All this being said, there have been some things I've been thinking about doing or purchasing that I feel would benefit me. For example, I'd like to buy a top of the line Sonicare toothbrush. Maybe a Waterpik as well. That's a few hundred bucks. My oral hygiene isn't horrible, but it could use some work. And I would consider this a long term investment in myself and in my health. An ounce of prevention goes a long way.

I've also been thinking about giving myself a monthly book allowance. I haven't read a book all the way through in a very long time and that makes me sad. I'd probably focus on classics to begin with: The Wealth of Nations, Leviathan, Treatises on Government by John Locke and political writings by Rousseau. But I feel that reading anything, even fiction, is beneficial to pretty much everyone.

Finally, I've been thinking I might like to celebrate the new job with a nice bottle or two of single malt scotch. Something along the lines of Ardbeg or Laphroaig. Talisker... 

Anyway, I am very conscious, and somewhat terrified, of lifestyle drift. Just because I am making more does not mean I should spend more. And I guess the question I'm sort of asking here is... When do I give myself a break and let myself have something I want? And when do I hold back and keep pushing?

B) Afford to continue making my minimum monthly car payments through November, put a lump sum of about $5,000 toward the car payment in December, and then make extra loan payments to pay my car off no later than the end of 2022. 

I can afford to make extra car loan payments beginning next year because I won't have to withhold any extra on my taxes anymore. I'm currently withholding a few extra hundred dollars per month to make up for underpayment of subsidized health insurance premiums (based on income) during the first half of the year as well as to cover taxes for a Roth conversion I did in March. 

The current balance on the auto loan is $15,995 and the interest rate is 5.94%. Minimum monthly payments are $312.69. I can get that down to about $9,200 by the end of the year (including the $5,000 lump sum). I should then be able to start making payments $558 per month (or more, if my income continues to increase) until it's paid off.

My question is... Which option should I choose and why? Should I live at home longer and pay off my car sooner? Or should I get out of mom's place by January 2021 and take a little longer to pay off my car?

ktzghh,Just-A-Random-Guy-92,"The Saver's Credit - A Quirky Income Problem

Hi, everyone. I'll get right into it and try to keep this relatively short.

For tax year 2020, the maximum saver's credit I can get is $200 (10% of a maximum contribution to a qualified retirement account of $2,000), subject to an AGI limit of $33,000. In 2020, I will have made about $31,000 in earned income (wages). However, I also performed a Roth conversion in March. The total distribution was just over $4,000 and I have no other deductions, apart from paltry student loan interest (which I didn't even really get this year since all my loans have been in forbearance). My traditional IRA is now empty. 

So... My AGI is a few thousand over the limit for earning the saver's credit. However, I was wondering if I could (or if it would be prudent to) make a backdoor Roth contribution. I am in a somewhat unique situation here where my income allows me to make fully deductible IRA contributions and also contribute to a Roth IRA. However... I made too much to earn the saver's credit, which is essentially a free $200. And this will likely be the last year I can earn it.

So my thinking is that I would make a contribution of approximately $2,000-2,500 to my traditional IRA with after-tax dollars, deduct that on my taxes so that I would meet the AGI limit for the saver's credit, and then convert the monies to my Roth IRA. I should be able to deduct the traditional contribution because the money going in is after-tax... The only issue (and it's a big issue that might make this whole thing untenable or at least stupid to begin with) is that if I did this, because I deducted my contributions to lower my AGI, I would have to turn right around and pay tax again on the conversion. On $2,000, effective federal and state taxes in my bracket would probably come to something like 15% or $300. That would mean my net ""profit"" from this whole exercise would be negative one hundred dollars. Of course, I realize that not qualifying for the saver's credit is a good thing because eit means I made more money. But that $4,000 conversion wasn't really usable, earned wages. So I'll feel a bit cheated if I can't get it. 

So... Let me know. Am I thinking about this correctly? Thanks for all your help!

When I got fired from that job, I decided to go a different direction and explore the financial services industry. I had no experience. I found a small RIA (financial planning firm) and started working for there for minimum wage. I learned a lot but the company was badly mismanaged and lacked any semblance of organization.

After 14 months of working there, I was recruited by another local firm where I currently work. They started me at $16 per hour and gave me a raise to $17 after a 60 day probationary period. This was stipulated in my employment offer. I started making $17 an hour back in August and have not had a review since that time. No health insurance, no 401k or other profit sharing plan. Just two weeks a year of vacation. I will have two years in the financial services industry this coming March. In that time, I have passed my series 65, which is required for one to become an Investment Advisor Representative and to actually charge money for investment advice. I have also been studying for my CFPÂ® Certification Examination, which I will be taking this March 16th. The certification is well-known and respected in the industry. 

My job duties include:

- Opening new accounts
- Transferring accounts between custodians
- Servicing existing accounts
- Completing and sending paperwork to clients for signature
- Depositing and and making distributions of money from client accounts on request
- Limited trading within accounts
- Tracking net new assets coming into the firm
- Billing clients monthly in arrears
- Compiling and organizing fees and commission statements from insurance products, including annuities
- Maintaining numerous monthly spreadsheets to track payment of all our advisors
- Minor accounting and bookkeeping
- Making sure office supplies are ordered.

I also act as a sort of officer liaison. I man the phones and direct calls, making sure they are taken and/or responded to. And if our custodian or a third party vendor needs to be called, I'm the one doing it. I have experience with Redtail, Black Diamond, FinaMetrica, a little bit of Riskalyze, TD Ameritrade, Charles Schwab, and I am familiar with most types of forms and what they are used for.

Am I worth more than $17 an hour? If not, will I be after I take (and pass) the CFPÂ® Certification Examination? I know I'm still young and new to the industry, but I feel like I'm being underpaid. Am I just being entitled or am I being underpaid?",Yes,Yes,No,No,Yes
lep77l,Just-A-Random-Guy-92,"Help With My Budget?

Hey, guys. I was on Facebook this morning and came across a post from a friend asking everyone who had their own home or apartment to sound off. Well, I sounded off by asking how everyone could afford that. I make $17 an hour and I can't even afford a 1BR/1BA apartment in my area. And some guy had the audacity to tell me I needed to manage my money better, because people make a lot less than that and can do it. At first, I was honestly offended. But then I realized that he could, possibly, be right. I've always thought my budget is pretty bare bones. I'm not crazy frugal, but I also don't go out and buy everything my little heart desires. Quite to the contrary. Anyway, I thought I would come here to see if my budget really needs some tinkering or if this other guy is full of shit. So without further ado:

&amp;#x200B;

Monthly Net Pay (Approximate) - $2,175

YouTube Music - $9.99

Storage Space - $73.00

Mobile Phone (Device &amp; Plan) - $109.54

Gym Membership - $19.99

Gas - $30.00

Miscellaneous - $25.00

Car Insurance - $177.00

Health Insurance - $282.73

Food - $300.00

Auto Loan - $312.69

Dental Insurance - $34.96

Student Loans (PAYE) - $68.00 (Total Debt Burden is Approximately $34,000)

&amp;#x200B;

That leaves me with about $730 per month. And apartments around here cost 70-80% more than that, minimum (reference: [https://www.apartments.com/germantown-md/](https://www.apartments.com/germantown-md/)). That's without even taking utilities into account. To address a few items above, I know my food budget is a little high. But it's not spent eating out. I try to eat pretty healthfully and that costs a little bit extra. My auto loan and insurance are also pretty high. For the loan... It kinda is what it is. I need my car. And for the insurance, I've been in some BS accidents in the past where I've hit debris in the road that was pretty much unavoidable. And of course I'm at fault for that, so my premiums are high. But I recently got a quote for per-mile insurance that will provide me with substantial savings. Finally, health insurance is expensive. But it's not something I'm willing to compromise on. I don't qualify for subsidies.

Is my budget reasonable or am I spending too much on things I don't need (or even things I do need)?",Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes

mbtmfq,Just-A-Random-Guy-92,"Cost-of Living Comparison

Hi, all. First... I just wanted to say that I *did* try to post this in r/jobs, but apparently that subreddit is now private. That being said... 

I am in talks with a company out in Carmel, Indiana, which is a suburb of Indianapolis. The person who reached out to me first mentioned that starting pay out there would be $51,000. I take this with a grain of salt, but this figure seems reasonable given the industry, my credentials, and my level of experience.

I am currently in the DMV/Washington, DC metropolitan area. I'm actually in a Maryland suburb (think Rockville, Gaithersburg, Bethesda, Potomac if you're at all familiar with the area) and I am making $35,360 per year. You can probably see why I want to change jobs.

I'm any case, I am just looking for input on whether $51,000 is a fair wage (in general) out in Indiana. Meaning... How far will it go, irrespective of of what I should or should not be making in my potential new position? I did a little bit of research and it seems like the cost of living out there is about 35% less than it is where I am currently, so I'm effectively getting an even bigger raise in real terms than I am in absolute terms. It seems like $51,000 in Carmel, Indiana is about equal to $78,500 in my Maryland suburb, which would mean I'd basically more than double my salary.

I am getting ready to move out of state for a new job I start in May and I'll be making significantly more than I am now. However, all of my main expenses are very much ""front loaded"" at the beginning of the month and that will make it difficult to afford rent all at once. My monthly budget is as follows:

\- Gross Pay: $4,250

\- Taxes: $877.08

\- Pretax Medical/Dental/Vision Premiums: $337

\- Net Pay: $3,035.92

This means I'll be bringing home about $1,517.96 per paycheck. At the beginning of the month, I anticipate my expenses to be the following:

\- Rent: $1,215

\- Renter's Insurance: $15

\- Auto Loan: $313

\- Roth 401k: $127.50

\- Auto Insurance: $87

\- Internet/WiFi: $40

\- Electric: $85

\- Water/Sewer: $30

\- Mobile Phone: $110

\- Food: $175

That puts me $680 in the negative. When I get paid again, I will net the difference: $1517.96-$680 =$837.96. That will leave me to pay the following:

\- Roth 401k: $127.50

\- Food: $175

That will leave me with $535.46 to save, invest, buy furniture, eat out more, go out on dates (God willing), etc.

r177h9,JustMeerkats,"Second Opinions on Upcoming Decisions

Hi yall! I'm on mobile, so I apologize for any typos and/or formatting issues. I'm internally struggling with some decisions regarding how best to use some funds, mainly around Roth IRAs. 

Some points before I start:

- My husband and I are both in our late 20s
- We both work full time, netting around ~67k/yr
- No kids (yet....currently TTC after an early mc)
- We own our own home in a very low COL area 
- We have two vehicles that are financed 
- No credit card debt 
- No student loans (praise the feeeze on interest that allowed us to pay everything off)
- We have approximately 6 months worth of expenses in savings, plus enough to cover our medical deductibles if need be. 

My husband has to have some extensive dental work done soon. He has an appointment with an oral surgeon in the start of 2022. We don't know exactly how expensive it will be, but I can imagine it will be upwards of 5k+. We would like to pay out of pocket for this. He is on my company's dental plan and just added his company's dental plan to have the extra coverage.   

He has also applied to go back to school for his masters.  It would be entirely online, and he would continue to work full time throughout the duration of the program. He doesn't want to rake out loans for that, and if he only takes one course a semester, I believe we could swing it. Before anyone asks: no, his employer will not pay for this (or any degree).  It's an entirely different field than what he currently does. 

I've been delving into retirement and investing.  I have a small investing account that gets $100 added every month.  I have been looking into the magic that are Roth IRAs. I would like to have us both start one and preferably max it out. 

However, I'm not sure that maxing out a Roth would be the way to go woth the upcoming expenses that we know we will have. Between school, dental work, and a potential baby, I'm just not sure it'd be the smartest decision.  I suppose I'm just looking for second opinions of what others would do in a similar situation.  

I will gladly answer any follow-up questions if you have any.

**Option B**: Pay down the house to 20% of its original price (so 15% down- $51,300).   We want this to be our forever home.

ue4c85,JustMeerkats,"Explain Taxes to Me like I'm a Toddler...

Hi everyone.  I am confused about tax brackets and standard deductions.  

My husband and I contribute to Roth IRAs every year.  I understand the kicker with Roth funds are that they are post-tax dollars- that is, you have already paid taxes on them in the highest tax bracket.  Most people will benefit more from a traditional 401(k)/traditional IRA because they will be making more money in retirement than while they were working- therefore, deferring the taxes until retirement is beneficial.

So, getting into the meat and potatoes...

The obvious thing that you would want to do is to have enough of your taxable income lowered until you are pushed into a lower bracket.  For example, for married, filing jointly, your taxable income  must be between 20,550 and 83,500 to be in the 12% tax bracket.  **Does this include the standard deduction of $25,900?** In other words, if a couple grossed $109,000 for the year, would they be taxed at 22% or 12% (which is what bracket they would be in if they took the standard deduction)?  Or is each person taxed separately?

I'm sorry if this is coming across as dense.  I really don't understand how taxes are formulated for each person in a MFJ situation.

I hope this post makes sense!",Yes,Yes,No,Yes,No

I'm wondering what the best allocations for my 457(b) plan are.

I am 27 years old.  I have a Roth IRA through Fidelity, as well as a 401(k) with about 10k in it.  I am going to roll the 401(k) into an IRA (also through Fidelity). 

I believe my best options are:  
\- 2060 target date fund (easiest option). The expense ratio is 1.34%  
\- S&amp;P500 Fund, 0.94% ER  
\- US Broad Market Index Fund (tracks Russell 3000), 0.94% ER  
\- US Growth and Income Fund, 1.14% ER

There are other funds, but the above are the ones I am most familiar with due to my age and personal, albeit limited research.

I have a 2013 Ford F-150 that I bought 2 years ago this June. I still owe about $15k on it and it has just over 180k miles. I bought it right when all used cars/trucks were sky high so that doesnâ€™t help but it is what it is.

Managed to rack up about $9k of credit card debt over the last couple years from an assortment of stuff. (Bad luck, dumb purchases, interest etc) 

I made a plan about a year ago to really attack it and started giving $1000 a month to them. Managed to pay one off but still have some that total to where Iâ€™m at now which is around $9k (started with around that amount but had some emergencies and other dumb purchases) 

My last dumb purchases was to buy a Harley. I know I know. Financed it for $8k while still being able to pay every bill while having around $1000 left over every month. 

Anyway, with riding season in the thick of it, I decided that I would post my bike and see what happens. Well apparently I got a really good deal on it and a guy wants to give me $14,500 for it at the first of June. So if and when I sell it, I will be pocketing just under $7000.

Or 

Keep it in my bank account and continue on my same plan that I have been doing and give $1000 a month?

Iâ€™ve been going back and forth for months and months whether I should buy or rent. My ideal situation is a ranch style home with a garage for all my tools, hobbies, etc 

Problem is, the KC market, especially just south of it, is absolutely ridiculous right now. Especially for starter homes. The prices are okay but a little on the higher side but the bigger problem is the supply of starter homes is basically little to none. And any that do pop up are sold sometimes in the same day.

My expenses were low since I was still living at home. Left that job and accepted a new position making $2500 a month. That job didnt pan out, however, I also moved into am apartment at $875 a month and also traded in my truck for a newer one at $32k in the same week.

Im obviously getting rid of the truck since I really dont need that much truck. However, I do need a truck. Living in the country in the midwest, roads arent the best and we can get bad winters. On top of that, I have a 23 foot travel trailer that I pull quite a bit. Bottom line, I need a truck. 

However, as most of you know, the truck market is just nuts right now so finding a good truck for a cheaper price is almost impossible.

So right there, I would save a few hundred dollars or so by getting a bike and scratch the itch I have for it. Dumb idea? Or not bad?",Yes,Yes,No,No,No
un1u6l,KansasDude25,"I feel trapped almost with the current state of the economy paired with my financial situation

I guess this is more of a rant than anything but I would welcome any advice. 

Will be turning 27 this August. I make $42k a year gross in a okay cost of living area in the Midwest (Kansas). There are places that are expensive but not terrible. 

Long story short.. I daily drive my 2013 F-150 40 miles a week round trip to work. I owe currently $18k on it and pay $380 a month for it. I was living in an apartment paying almost $1000 for everything associated with that. Last month my lease ended so I decided to move back home for a bit to save some money and get a game plan together. 

I also have about $6k in CC debt. Other than my truck and the CCâ€™s, thatâ€™s all my debt. 

Recently, since I got this newer better paying job, Iâ€™ve been thinking about getting a motorcycle. I have no problem with financing it but I kinda feel guilty almost wanting to get one now that Iâ€™m living back at home. But with gas being at $4.00 a gallon today, I donâ€™t think me getting 12mpg and filling up for $120 bucks, give or take, every week or so is sustainable. Thatâ€™s partly why I think a motorcycle may be good, not only for my wallet, but also my mental health. 

I donâ€™t currently have anything for ME. I just go to work, come home, eat, and go to bed. 5 days a week. I want SOMETHING, that brings me happiness. 

Again, Iâ€™m just not sure what route to take. I love my truck, and use it to fish and hunt and pull our camper in the warmer months, but damn is it costing me more than I want lol 

So, should I, continue on my current plan which is to just pay of my CCâ€™s as quickly as possibly and then just save some money until I find another apartment? 

Or

Finance a motorcycle, to save on my monthly fuel expense to put more money towards CCâ€™s so I can get those paid off quicker? While having something that brings me a lot of joy. 

So, idk, I know I kind of rambled on there but I think you guys get the idea. Just kind of in a weird spot financially and in life and would like an open discussion!",Yes,Yes,No,Yes,Yes
uxkgdz,KansasDude25,"Should I drop my 401k contributions down in order to pay off CC debt faster?

Right now Iâ€™m taking home around $2200 a month. I owe $7300 in CC debt with my only major monthly expense being my truck payment at $380. Everything else is small in relation. 

Iâ€™m contributing 6% to my 401k each paycheck. My question is, should I lower that contribution just until I can pay off CC debt and then bring it back up to the 6% after thatâ€™s done? Or would it really not make a difference?",No,Yes,No,No,No
y6v5jv,KansasDude25,"Repair My Truck or Trade In?

So long story short, after some iffy decisions on my part, I bought my 2013 f150 1.5 years ago. I financed it since I was getting out of my very expensive truck and into something more realistic. 

Anyway, I owe $17k on it with 176k miles. Iâ€™m probably upside down about $2k-$4k depending on the day. Which I was okay with because I planned on driving it until it blew up. 

Well, I donâ€™t know for sure how much itâ€™s going to cost, but some repair codes and what the truck is doing in general has me thinking itâ€™s going to need some decent transmission work. Which is never cheap. Iâ€™m estimating between $1,500-$6,000. Again, I wonâ€™t know for sure until Wednesday. 

But that brings me to my question, if it is worst case scenario, so I trade it off and cut my losses, or just add to my upside down situation and pay to get it fixed? 

I understand that if I do get this fixed, it will probably be set of many many years. But that would pretty much put me at owing $23k on the truck that has almost 180k miles and is almost 10 years old. 

Just need some different opinions!",No,Yes,No,No,Yes
y8lhlf,KansasDude25,"Stuck with a $6k car repair bill and not sure which route to go

So long story short, I have owned my 2013 F-150 for 1.5 years now. I really like the truck and planed on keeping it until the wheels fell off. Itâ€™s got 176k miles on it. However, I bought it when used car prices, especially trucks were stupid high. So I overpaid but itâ€™s in great shape. 

I still owe $16,800 on it. So I am upside down which didnâ€™t bother me very much because I planned on keeping it a long time. 

However, shit started happening with it and long story short, it needs a new transmission to the tune of $6k. 

So Iâ€™m not sure if itâ€™s a good idea to put $6k into a truck with almost 180k miles on it. I also have no way of affording that since Iâ€™m trying to pay off an additional $7k in CC debt. 

So Iâ€™m not sure if I either 

A. Trade it in on a newer truck and roll my old loan difference into the new loan, (which isnâ€™t ideal), and get a newer truck with a warranty and less miles

Or 

B. Get the transmission fixed and keep the truck forever since everything else on it is solid. 


Either way itâ€™s just shitty luck and something Iâ€™m just dealing with head on instead of dwelling on it. 

And I am working hard at getting rid of most of my debt. I give $1000 a month to CCâ€™s so those will be chipped down by next spring. 

But I would like opinions from everyone lol",No,Yes,No,No,No

Monthly expenses include groceries which is about $300 a month, car insurance $140, car payment $262 Phone bill $50, a few online service like Hulu, Disney Plus and Apple Music ~$25, and other things like gas $35-50, etc.

This has been discussed for a while now, and we agreed on them finding a four bedroom home for all of us to live.

My wife hates the idea as she doesnâ€™t like my parents, and would have to leave all her family behind. I donâ€™t like it because I finally got the position I wanted after a few years and I would hate to leave after only a year of holding the position.

Like I mentioned before, I donâ€™t see any other solution, and once we move we would all have to find new jobs too, and while they may pay more an hour, K might just end up making either the same or less of what I am now.

Is there any advice anybody can give?",No,Yes,No,No,Yes
findx3,kevalopez,"Should I get dental insurance?

So this month my employer decided to offer some of health, dental, vision and life insurance. I ultimately decided on not choosing health as itâ€™s too expensive and would only cover me; I also decided not to get vision because I already had a checkup this year, and when it comes to lice Insurance, I already have a plan with StateFarm.

Now the last type of insurance Iâ€™m thinking about is dental, it would cost me $31.55 a month, and again would only cover myself, and while my employers couldnâ€™t give me much info about it they told me they think itâ€™s Delta Dental, and that it covers a set of x-rays and one or two cleaning a year.

I,m 21 years old, havenâ€™t been to the dentists in 2 years I believe, but I plan on going very soon, and seeing as my last day to decided is today I wanted to ask here if it was worth getting this plan, or go without insurance? The reason I ask this is because I have heard that a lot of dental insurance companies only pay so much and have long waiting periods before they do anything.

fng64a,kevalopez,"How to prepare for son losing medicaid

So like I mentioned in other past different posts of my own, Iâ€™m 21 years old, married and with one 11 month old child. My wife and I both work and we made $25,500 and will make about the same if not a little more above that this year.

Now,my job is a full time job as a Department Manager at a McDonaldâ€™s in our small town that pays me $9.75 an hour and gives overtime every week.

My wife only works a small gig at a local church for $9.85 an hour and makes about $100-$150 a month.

Currently we have no insurance of any type whatsoever (except car insurance and life insurance for myself) besides medicaid for our child. We currently qualify for it but after he turns one, the income limit drops to about $2,750, and we make right below that.

The main problem is that I want her to get a job so we can eventually move out from my parents, pay our car off and in the future be able to afford our own health insurance.

Now my employer does offer insurance but only the bare minimum, and it would cost around $600 or more to insure my hole family.

We have had to take our child to the ER before for dehydration issues and have had him transferred to a bigger hospital in Fort Worth three times in mess than a year; I know this could probably bankrupt us if we didnâ€™t have medicaid.

Should we go ahead with our plan and have my wife get a better job but lose our sonâ€™s medicaid, or just stay below the limit and have him covered for a few more years?",No,Yes,No,No,Yes
fwqlmr,kevalopez,"Employer might stop giving overtime

I'm a 22 year old that works at a franchised McDonald's as a Kitchen Department Manager making $9.75/hr, and have worked there for about 8 months so far, and was given one raise of $.75 back in December.

About a month ago when all this covid-19 scare began, almost everybody at work has had reduced hours, and when it comes to all the managers, we have had 0 scheduled overtime hours, when we usually used to get anywhere between 5 - 10 every week. My pay has never been good, but overtime always made up for it as I would always get roughly 20 - 30 overtime hours per month.

That aside, we haven't been able to meet our labor percentage goal, which is something like 21%, but now we are able to that we have less people scheduled, but I'm afraid that even when all this comes to normal, my employer will either reduce or give no more overtime to any of us. Most of the other managers don't seem to mind, they just go to work and expect to get good pay, but I'm always looking at the numbers and as of this month I am losing about $300 per month, which makes a lot of difference to me as that was almost all the savings I was getting form my job.

Ultimately my question is, when this is all over and we go back to normal, if my employer decides to give little to no overtime, should I ask for a raise, and if so how should I come to him about that? I'd probably have to ask for a raise to at least $11/ht, which seems too high for them to agree to in my opinion, but I am uncertain.",Yes,Yes,No,No,Yes
gcu3ao,kevalopez,"Should I move early or later on?

A little background: Iâ€™m 22 years old, married with a one year old child and living with my parents as we canâ€™t afford a place of our own with my income.

Iâ€™m graduating next week from college with an Associate of Applied Sciences in Business Management.

I work as a department manager at a McDonaldâ€™s making $9.75 and hour. My wife doesnâ€™t currently have a job ( she worked at a church making a bit of money but church is closed right now because of Covid-19) as itâ€™s hard finding one with mine since it requires me working overtime and going in on some of my days off. That aside we have tried looking for a job for her, but all we find is part time low paying jobs that are not worth the time because they have schedules that go all over the place, and because the little money sheâ€™d make would put us right above the limit to qualify for our childâ€™s medicaid.

We made $25,500 last hear and I expect to make around the same, if not a little more, this year. Savings are at $4,700 plus $2,500 owed by parents, that they have available and will pay back once home deal is signed off and done. Background done

So, we plan on moving with my parents to their new home in a border city (Brownsville, Tx) later this year; the plan is for the house to be finished by July and them signing off by the end of that month so that itâ€™s ready to move in by August.

Now, if you have read my other posts, I have mentioned this before, but I basically have two choices, I either leave  on September and look for a new job for myself and hopefully also my wife, or I wait until January to do so.

The only thing that keeps me from making my mind are two things;
1. - If we move earlier we can both try to find a job that offers health insurance by or before open enrollment. (We currently have no insurance).
2.- I have read that while living in Brownsville is cheap, the jobs there pay very little (mostly minimum wage) and Iâ€™m scared that Iâ€™ll end up with a similar or worse job as I have right now being paid less with less benefits or bonuses.

So technically, I can leave early and look for a new job hoping itâ€™s better and offers benefits, or stay until January, save the money I will make at my current job and get more monthly bonuses on those last four months ( and christmas bonus) and leave on January, but lose any chance of finding a good employer that offers affordable insurance.

gmzm5z,kevalopez,"What is a good career?

So, Iâ€™m a 22 year old man married with a one year old and still living with parents.
I just completed my AAS in Business Management degree at my local college, and donâ€™t plan to go any further (thus why I chose AAS).

I currently work as a Kitchen Department Manager at a local McDonaldâ€™s making $9.75 (plus bonuses), and Iâ€™m going to make roughly $24-$25 K by myself this year.

My wife currently has no job as the job market here sucks, there are only part time positions available that give very little hours, and since we make right under the limit for our child to qualify for medicaid, I told my wife to only accept full time positions, but she hasnâ€™t had much luck in the past few months.

We are gonna have to move with my parents to another town by the end of the year and we will both look for better jobs there, but honestly I donâ€™t know much about what kind of jobs to look for that would help me grow both on a good career and financially. 

Right now, I feel like Iâ€™m gonna be stuck at low pay jobs for a long time, which wonâ€™t help myself or my family achieve our goals later in life.

gwmxuu,kevalopez,"I need help choosing between moving my family with parents or moving on our own

Quick background; I'm 22 years old married with a one year old child all of us living with my parents. I have a job at McDonald's that pays 9.75/hr and I will roughly make 25k this year out of it (if I worked all year). My wife is a stay at home mother, and while she has been looking for jobs for a while, she hasn't been successful to find anything beyond part-time jobs, and this isn't something we can have as if we go above the limit for our child's medicaid he would lose it, and a part-time job wouldn't be worth it losing it over.

The only debt we have is our car which is roughly $9,000 and we pay extra every month, we hope to pay it off in less than a year with the tax returns we might get next year. Our savings is roughly $5,500, plus an extra $3,500 we are owed and should get back on August/September.

Currently we live in a very small town in Texas with few opportunities, and my parents have already made plans to move in August to a border city in the same state. They asked us back in March if we would move with them, and our answer was ""most likely, but we will try anything in our power not to have to do that"". 

Yesterday my wife tells me that living with my parents stresses her out (which I understand because they do the same to me), and she'd like for us to move somewhere else after my parents leave this town and start a new life as a family. This really scares me as we both have no careers, we have little savings and no jobs lined up anywhere that are guaranteed to be permanent.

The reason I chose going to my parents was because we would have the safety net of living with them, and we could both get jobs that may sometimes overlap in schedules with little problem as long as my family helped with our child, and also we would save most of our money to eventually get our own house in the next five years.

While she agrees with this plan, she wants us to live on our own now, and while I would agree that it could be doable, it's risky. Also the fact that my parents already started the deal on a 4 room home, which should be done in the next three months, it would make me feel bad to tell them no and leave them with all the extra burden.

A lot of other things stress me out, like the fact that we have no health insurance, and; unless we're lucky; mos employers won't cover family plans and thus it would cost at least $600-$800 to cover our entire family; and this is something we would need because once we both have jobs our child will stop qualifying for medicaid.

Later this year, my wife is planning on getting a job too, so Iâ€™m worried that in the last few months of the year we would go over the limit for our child to qualify anymore.

When I first got that card I had a $350 limit and now I have uograded it to a Quicksilver One with a $1,050. Iâ€™ve always applied for a credit increase every six months but the most I get is an extra $100, which doesnâ€™t help much.

I know I must keep my credit utilization low so this plus the fact that a higher credit limit also affects my score has got me thinking on applying for a second card; either the Chase Freedom Unlimited or the Citi Double Cash back.

I probably soend close to $750 a month of my card and always pay it off fully so I havenâ€™t paid interest in years.

Hi everyone, Iâ€™ve posted here a while back and just wanted to ask for advice regarding my financial situation, especially healthcare.

Iâ€™m a 23 yo male married (22) with one child (2) and currently living with my parents as we canâ€™t afford rent. Wife is in college for nursing, still taking basics so sheâ€™s got at least two years left if not more.

I just got a new WFH job that gave me a huge pay bump. I make 16/hr + 10% bilingual differential + commission. Roughly $36k/yr base plus commission, which might be around $750 or more per month. 

Currently my wife and I are uninsured because we just canâ€™t simply afford 8k per year. Thankfully our child is on medicaid but I believe heâ€™s about to be put on CHIP because of the new job, so best case scenario heâ€™s good for the rest of the year on a not so expensive plan.

My wife and I do have dental and vision insurance though, as my employer covered the cost of those yearly.

Expenses are: (monthly)
Groceries -$400
Media - $25
Phone - $80
Car &amp; Life Insurance (me) - $135
Internet - $25
Utilities - $250
Pull ups - $70
401K - $140
Gas - $100 but varies
Tithing - 10%

What Iâ€™m worried about is that by next year I might be making at least 45K or more which might cause two problems, one is that my child might not qualify for CHIP anymore and that means Iâ€™ll have to get healthcare from employer as we wouldnâ€™t qualify for subsidies (Texas) and that would be $9K per year. 

Second is that my wife might not qualify for a lot of financial aid and we might have to pay for that too, though Iâ€™m unsure how it works and it might not be a big deal like healthcare.

I do believe some people can save a lot, especially if they have incident/violations in their reports when switching, but when it comes to me I can probably find savings of $100-300 a year, but I know some companies give you a discount for being loyal with your previous company or having a good Insurance Score (which supposedly goes down if you switch to much) and also for being a new customer but those discounts ultimately go away and I may end up with the same or worse price.

I need to make a decision by next week, and while my brain says to go for the most expensive plan, I want to ask for advice first to make sure I make the right choice.

If everything goes right then my wife will have her own coverage with her company and our son will be under my policy, so the prices are just for my son and I (3 yr old).

I donâ€™t expect any doctorâ€™s visits from my part since Iâ€™m very healthy and so is the rest of my family, but my son has had to go to the ER 3-4 times this year for small accidents/sicknesses and has had to go to the doctor about 5 times in the past two months because of an ear infection.

Because of that I wanna make sure I choose the right plan for him. I should also mention that while I do have an HSA right now on my plan, I donâ€™t usually put much money in it ($200-$300/yr) since our budget is tight.

My company offers the following health insurance plans:

Plan 1: $5,050/yr. Ded - $3K/IND $6K/FAM. OOPMs - $4.5K/IND $9K/FAM. 
Plan is embedded. HSA Eligible.

Plan 2: $6,400/yr. Ded - $4K/FAM. OOPMs $6K/FAM.
Aggregate. HSA Eligible.

Plan 3: $7,900/yr. Ded - $1.5K/IND $3K/FAM. OOPMs - $4.5K/IND $9K/FAM.

I don't want to pour all of my money into my student loans given the political climate currently and possibly a 10k forgiveness.. With that said I'm thinking of investing a portion of my money for eventually purchasing a house, wedding, more student loans and etc. I am currently contributing 6% to a roth 401k my company offers. 

Is me looking to invest a smart or dumb move? I just dont want to wait to pay off all of my student debt before I start having some money aside for other things other than retirement. 

Should I open up a roth IRA or a brokerage account? 

I am 24 years old and trying to make smart financial decisions, any advice helps. Thanks!",Yes,Yes,No,No,Yes
lx7ncl,Kuzzy2019,"My 50 year old parents who have no understanding of how to handle their finances are seeking investment advice.. I donâ€™t know where to start

To preface my parents immigrated to the US in their mid 20s with two kids. From what I understand, their home country did not have â€œretirement plans.â€ They did not invest their money in the stock market. Because my dad had a very stable and high paying job, they did better than most. Then they immigrated to the states and continued to use the same mentality, thinking that through hard work they will be able to achieve what they wanted. My parents decided to invest in the family and bought a house without having the money for one. They still have that mortgage (I believe its a 30 year one). They racked up about 20k credit card debt. My dad started his own transportation business therefore never had a 401k or an IRA. They also lease their cars and believe that theyâ€™re saving money long term because they donâ€™t have to pay for car repairs. They pretty much live paycheck to paycheck from what I understand and have little savings. I dont think they have an emergency fund. My dad has been talking to his buddies who have been investing from a young age and opened up a fidelity account. He put 1k into random stocks that he heard â€œare doing wellâ€ and is seeking advice from me because I work in finance. I am not a financial advisor or an investment banker and only know what I know from work and my own research but I feel like I am in no position to give advice, especially knowing that debt and emergency savings are priority over investments. The only thing I could think of i advising them to open roth iras or SEP iras but even then I dont know what Iâ€™m talking about. My dadâ€™s goal is to invest for 5-10 years and have something to give to his children because he realized he doest have much to provide for us.

11zpk8f,l00t9,"Should my dad be maxing out his 401k?

My dad (66) is currently contributing $1200 monthly to his 401k. Which is $14.4k pa. A number he says he probably decided randomly when he started the new 401k with his new employer in 2018. Someone mentioned though that he can contribute upto $30k for 2023? 

If thatâ€™s the case, should I ask him to email his HR and ask them to deduct, say just shy of $3k/mo from Mar-Dec ($27k) to reach the $30k limit?

Here are his financial stats:

**Annual salary:** ~$95k pa

**Investments:** ~$277k (VT/BNDW 60/40)

401k (with new employer): $42k

Fidelity brokerage+rollover IRA: $170k

(He has started contributing the max of $14k pa to this IRA for himself + wife since 3 years)

iBonds: $40k

Checking a/c: $27k

**Monthly expenses:** ~$2.5-3k

Groceries: $500

Rent &amp; Utilities: $1200

Insurance premiums: $600

Other expenses 

**Retirement plan:**

Doesnâ€™t really have anything in mind, takes each day as it comes and intends to keep working until he can. Once he retires, he can expect to receive $4-5k (combined for himself+wife) in SSA. No other income. 

Based on the above, should he max out his 401k until retirement? Any other advice?

Also - has he made the right choice by holding a traditional rollover IRA instead of a Roth? If not, can/should he swap?

123y4mr,l00t9,"What should my dad write to his HR to max out his 401k please?

My dad is 66 (AGI $95k) and contributes only $600 ($471 self + $171 employer match of 40%) to his 401k twice a month for a total of $1200.

I just learnt that the 401k contribution limit for 2023 (age 50+) is $30k.

So I want him to reach out to his HR to max his contributions.

Should he do the calculations himself and tell them that he wants to increase the contributions to XYZ amount or just ask them directly to â€œmax the contributionsâ€ and let them calculate themselves and deduct the respective amount?

The reason I ask this is - if he does the calculations himself, Iâ€™m scared we might make an error and possibly over-contribute.

If we indeed have to calculate ourselves and give the number to HR, does my below calculation look correct:

**Contributions YTD: $471x5 (as per his last salary slip) = $2145**

^ This is assuming the employer match does not count towards the annual $30k limit.

**Balance = $30k - $2145 = $27855**

**New contribution starting April = $27855/9 = $3095/mo**

So I can probably ask them to round it up to $3000/mo for the next 9 months to leave some from for error/avoid overcontribution?

P.S. Does increasing his contribution also mean the employer match will go up to 40% of the new amount?

My dad is 66 and his current 401k contribution is as follows:

**Own - $429 bi-monthly**

**Match - $171 bi- monthly**

For a total of $600 twice a month.

I want him to max out his contributions until retirement so I asked him to write to his HR, and he got a response that his max limit is $30k a year, but the companyâ€™s match is currently maxed out and wonâ€™t increase even if he increases his own contribution.

Thatâ€™s OKAY but this seems fishy to me because I asked dad if it was him or his HR who had decided on the $600 twice a month number when he first started the 401k 5 years ago and he thinks he had chosen it. So how is it possible that he co-incidentally chose the exact number at which his companyâ€™s match gets maxed out??

125ufib,l00t9,"How will my dadâ€™s Rollover IRAâ€™s withdrawals be taxed in the future?

My dad (66) had a 401k with his previous employer which he withdrew in 2018 because he was contemplating purchasing a house. That never happened and the money is now sitting in something called a â€œRollover IRAâ€ in Fidelity. He ended up having to pay $8k in taxes on that $100k withdrawal.

Since the past 3 years, I taught him to start contributing $7k into an IRA to save up on taxes. He didnâ€™t have to create a separate â€œtraditional IRAâ€ for this and instead, the contributions keep going into this â€œRollover IRAâ€.

Now what confuses me is thisâ€¦ the balance in this Rollover IRA consists of two things:

1) the old 401k balance which he withdraw and already PAID TAXES on, and 

2) the current $7k contributions heâ€™s making yearly, which are PRE-TAX.

So when he starts taking RMDs or withdrawing money from this Rollover IRA, wouldnâ€™t it be complicated to figure out taxes?

Also, why was the account labelled â€œRollover IRAâ€ instead of â€œRollover 401kâ€ when he first cashed out his old 401k?

My question is: Is that normal to get outbid to rent a house these days? I know that house bidding was a thing till maybe last year, but is still happening this year? Should I be more aggressive and more willing to pay even more if I wanted to move soon? Or would it be more prudent to wait till my lease expires and perhaps renew month-to-month to be flexible enough to move as soon as I find a good opportunity? There are no requirements for us to move sooner except for a better quality of life that we crave (currently living in a small apartment, in a not-so-desirable location).",Yes,Yes,No,No,Yes

I am moving from CMA to Schwab checking this week. I will keep my investing accounts though with fidelity. 
I had Schwab account before but went to CMA for consolidation yet now I recognized (after having an issue with them that they didnâ€™t resolve to my satisfaction) that CFBP couldnâ€™t resolve issues as they are not a true bank. I will lose some nice interest due to that move.
My question is for those who have accounts at both, how do you compare the customer service and the ease of resolving issues at each?

14oqm3t,lagflag,"Moving to a non no-fault state, how to get enough insurance protection?

We will be moving soon from New Jersey (no-fault state) to Indiana (non no-fault state). The first thing I noticed is how the Auto insurance has way lower premiums in IN than NJ (almost half the premiums!). 
After some searching I learned that this is probably because Indiana is a non no-fault state. 

While the lower premium is certainly appealing, I am concerned about how this could impact the payment of medical bills resulting from an accident. Specifically, I want to ensure that I have adequate protection in case I am injured in an accident, so that medical bills don't accumulate or end up in collections while waiting for insurance companies to determine fault. I have an excellent credit history, and I want to make everything possible to protect that.

In Indiana, I obtained a quote from Erie through an independent agent, and the auto policy offered $10,000 in medical pay. Additionally, I have health insurance through my employer. My main question is whether I should consider increasing the medical payment coverage beyond the $10,000 limit, or if combining it with my existing health insurance should be sufficient. I also inquired about the availability of Personal Injury Protection (PIP) coverage, but the agent seemed confused by my question, leading me to believe that PIP may not be available in Indiana...

We're a family of three. I lost my job earlier this month, and our health insurance will expire by the end of it. Fortunately, my employer's offering two extra months of COBRA premium coverage, which I'll accept. But by the end of February 2024, I'll likely lose my subsidized health insurance.

I work in accounting, and finding a new job might take a bit. My spouse is also re-entering the job market after being a homemaker for a couple of years, which might also take some time.

Financially, we're stable with enough savings to cover expenses for a year or more (in addition to retirement accounts). I'm thinking of switching to Obamacare before February 15th and dropping COBRA, as it won't be subsidized anymore.

Can I afford to pay more for housing?

I make $110K/yr, living in NJ with DW and our 1 year old baby.

I grandfathered a moderate income rent through a government program back when my income was lower. I pay 1350/mo for a 2 BDR apt and it can only increased couple of percentage a year as long as I am staying.

I donâ€™t like the apartment due to some reasons:
- False fire alarm goes off couple of times a year (day or night) and we gotta evacuate despite even if it is 2 am regardless how bad the weather outside is (now with a baby is is tougher). You never know when its time for the real fireâ€¦
- Noisy nearby road, and overall not so good area
- Small apartment with no dedicated room for me to work (I WFH since the pandemic), so it is challenging to find a spot to work effectively.

If I moved out, I would pay at least extra $1K/mo in rent (i.e $2,200/mo or more), alao I can buy a house up to (450K) and pay 20% down. 

My current spending is about $4200/mo, so there is some room for spending more but will come at the cost of our saving rate which is important as I would like to retire no more than age of 60.

Net worth is $400K and no debts.
Wife is staying home to take care of the baby for now. 

Also the schools rating here are low, so when the baby reaches the school age we will move anyways.

I live in NJ, paying inherited low rent (was through some program) in a non-desired small apartment, and eventually would need to move to a better school area when our child is at the school age at most.

I have saved already in cash (not to include retirement accounts) $128K, but according to YNAB I have only $31K can be used as down payment, while the rest is distributed among various categories (such as $33K for an upcoming second car since we have only one car now).

My wife is currently staying home, but once our child hits 2 years old mark she plans to send her to a daycare and search for a job (hence the need to the second car). My gross income is a bit over $100K. The choice I made is to pause the retirement savings (only contribute to 401K up to the employer match) so any extra would be put towards the home down payment (20% down + closing costs would be around $100K in NJ!).

The other choice I could do, is to forget about the 20% and do only 5% or so (with PMI) or more while continue maxing out retirement accounts. Also contributing to 401K would save me (in addition to the deferred federal income tax) another 3-5% in state income taxes.

Currently living in HCOL in NJ with wife and 2 years old.  
I am making $110K (including 401K match) and got an offer from an out of state employer for $125K (no 401K match- but better health insurance savings, could mean another $4K-$6K)  


Pros of the new employer in addition to the higher pay:  
\- 100% remote work is acceptable, allowing me to live somewhere cheaper (wife is staying home for the child currently, so moving out is relatively easy)  
\- Good culture (unlimited PTO, nice boss, etc)  
\- Better exposure to other things in my career  
\- Promising growing fast company  
\- New software to learn (will help my resume)  
Cons:  
\- New employer always comes with new risks and lot of what ifs  
\- Startup (not established in the market yet) company  


Pros of the existing employer:  
\- Have been over 6 years there, so relatively stable  
\- Team of 2 reporting to me (new employer can have this later, but now I will drive solo despite the same managerial title)  
\- Adopting new software, so I will have that too in my resume  
Cons (in addition to lower pay and have to live in HCOL NJ):  
\- I got really bored of the current tasks and feel I could get rusty over time at that level!  
\- Commuting (some times they can allow WFH for some reasons if I explained)  
\- Sharing the office with another coworker (not a real cons comparing to a cubical!)  
\- At expensive part of NJ (Central). I cannot move to south areas where houses are cheaper  


I already accepted the offer and when I did so I was so excited about it (and still), but haven't yet notified my current employer.  
Questions:  
\- Does the move make sense financially? I mean by that, risk (of something new versus something I know well) worth the salary difference?  
\- Which state and county I would be better at within the East coast (priority: schools- Health care- weather- lower cost of living specifically housing- diversity- quietness).

I was reading the resource below provided by this subreddit and I had some clarification questions.[https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/wiki/investing](https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/wiki/investing)

1. ""  If you're just getting started with investing in an IRA, your best bet  is a target date fund at Vanguard, Fidelity, or Schwab:""

I  just started investing back in November and have very little  understanding of what I am doing. I found a recommended three-fund  portfolio back then and have just been sticking to that since. Should I  take a step back and try using a target date fund instead?

2.  "" If you're doing this in a taxable account rather than an IRA, you  should  consider building a three-fund portfolio instead because target  date  funds are generally not tax-efficient""

What is a taxable account and how do I know if my Roth IRA is one?

3.  ""Whenever you add money, instead of adding money in the original   proportions, add the money in such a way that after you add money, your   portfolio is closer to your desired proportions.""

Location: Midwest USA in a medium cost of living area.

I am 35M, wife is 34F. We are planning on trying for a baby in a few months and will need a slightly larger house with more bedrooms. We would like to rent out our current house and buy another house to live in. 

My income: gross: $96,000.
Wife's income: gross is $33,000. When we have a baby she will stop working for a few years. 
Bonus income: rent out a cottage for $650 per month. 

We currently have a house and a side cottage. 
Mortgage is $800 per month that is escrowed.
House was only $75000 when it was bought in 2014. Came with a neat side cottage that we rent out.

Expenses:
Current house Mortgage: $800. Will increase to $900 if I rent it due to insurance going up when it switches from homeowner occupied to a rental.
Wife's car: $350.
My car is paid off. 
My wife sends $500 each month to help support her parents.
Our credit cards: 6x with minimum payment of $35 each but we pay $100. Balance is anywhere from $400 to $2,000 depending on the card. 
Phone and internet is total of $380.

Food is $800 per month. 

Water bill is $110.

Electric bill is $275.

My student loans will resume soon and will be $283 per month. 

Entertainment: $400 per month.

We would like to buy a new house but all of the houses are much more expensive with high interest.  We were approved for a $280,000 conventional loan though. 

We would like to rent out our old main house for $1200 and the cottage for $650 if we get a new house.
We will also still pay the water bill at the old house. 

If we buy a $250,000 home then the monthly mortgage escrowed will be about $2,500 per month. 
If we buy a $200,000 home then then monthly mortgage escrow will be about $2000 per month.

Quite a bit of new expenses plus the old mortgage increasing by $100 from $800 to $900.

Hi, 

I have a choice to make,  here are the facts:

Location,  USA, Midwest. Medium COL area. My age is 35.

Current job: municipal water ASFCME  job.  I am maxed out in how far I can go in terms of promotions. Yearly salary is $64,000. After overtime I can bring home about $70,000. Each year the raise is 3%.

I am 4 out of 10 years in to my job.  After 10 years I will be eligible for a pension when I am of retirement age.

Good insurance,  no 401k though. 

Commute time to work is 10 minutes there,  10 minutes back. 

I like the job but feel unappreciated a lot because of lack of leadership in management. This is how everyone feels in our department.

Potential new job:

Management of a water plant in the next city over.  Salary is $85,000 to $100,000. Their court contracts out there water jobs to an outside company instead of municipal government employees. 

Commute time: 30 minutes there,  30 minutes back. 

More responsibity, including hiring and firing,  ensuring regulations are met.

Work schedule is the same,  Monday through Friday 8 hours shifts with occasional weekends on call. 

Does offer 401K with 3% employer match. 

Benefits are similar but due to non union is potentially less secure long term. 

Situation: wife wants to stop working,  after we have a baby,  her salary is $34,000. Planning on trying for a baby in Sept.

Right now we are able to save about $2000 each month,  but that is with my wife working too.

eyvcmv,littledorysunshine,"When to contribute to retirement?

I have been diligently paying down my debt for the last few years, and I'm very nearly done! The only thing I have left is:

&amp;#x200B;

$550 for computer purchase (interest-free until May)

$450 for phone (interest-free until March of next year)

$17684 in federal student loans (average 4.16% fixed interest rate, PSLF/RePAYE)

$180 medical bill I will pay this month

&amp;#x200B;

The computer could be paid off in full now, but my plan is to do it in April. The phone I have set up for automatic payments and it will be paid in full before the interest-free period expires.

&amp;#x200B;

I take home about $1020 biweekly from my main job, after taxes, insurance and mandatory CalPERS contribution (10%). I also make about $985/mo net at a second job (non-taxable), but that will probably end sometime this year. At this point, the secondary job income will be going to my emergency fund.

&amp;#x200B;

I am easily able to handle my monthly expenses with my main job with some leftover for discretionary spending. Budget:

Rent: $500

Groceries: $350

Phone: $78

Gas: $75-100

Renter/Auto insurance: $116

Pet spending: $200

Student loan: $79

Dining out: $150

Fun: $150

Gym: $50

&amp;#x200B;

The other $350ish/mo has been going to kill most of that debt. Now that's mostly gone I'm wondering if I should up my retirement contributions. I have to contribute 10% to CalPERS. I will be fully vested in about 2.5 years. There is no other match, but I can make payroll contributes to a 457b or Roth.

&amp;#x200B;

Am I also right in thinking that an e-fund for me, with a secure job, is about $5000 for 3 months? I'd prefer to get it a little higher, but I think $5k is a reasonable goal.

&amp;#x200B;

My other question is how to treat my student loans. I do have PSLF and I recertify every year. At this time, it seems like this is the most sensible option. If my income significantly increases, obviously I'll revisit.

iizmke,littledorysunshine,"Is pet insurance worth it?

I have a dog and a cat, and have pet insurance for both. They each have a deductible and the reimbursement is 90% after the deductible is met. It covers preventative/wellness care, which is everything we've done so far this year.

&amp;#x200B;

Year-to-date amount spend at the vet $2200. Didn't get a breakdown by pet, but most of it is the dog. Dental and a year's worth of flea/tick/heartworm preventative was about $1400. Granted, this is over 8 months but I've finished all the preventative care I need for the year. Unless one of them gets sick/injured I don't expect any more vet expenses.

This is the new premium amount for the 2020/2021 benefit year (cat's renewed in July, dog's in September). It was less last year, and goes up a little every year.

Cat: $100 deductible, $465.83 annual premium.

Dog: $250 deductible, $976.63 annual premium.

Total annual premiums: $1442.46

&amp;#x200B;

So, if I'm doing my math correctly, my reimbursements totaled $1665. ($2200-$350 deductible-$1850\*90% is $1665).

Again, if I'm doing my math correctly, I came out ahead by $222.54.

j3czjy,lljc00,"Shifting/increasing mortgage debt to rental property (from mortgage on primary residence) for tax reasons


I'm in the SF Bay Area, CA, in the process of getting divorced, and will move out and buy a new place. I have a rental house from before marriage that I have owned 20 years, and that I have spelled out in a pre-nup. Mortgage is the balance of a 15 year refinanced in 2012 for $200k (but I've been paying extra principle each month). FMV around $750k. 
$30k annual rental income
$4k mortgage interest last year
$12k other expenses (prop tax, repairs, bus expenses)
-----
$14k net profit

I anticipate that I will spend $1.5m on a new house. Not sure what I will put down (depends on where we shake out in the divorce settlement), but no plans to sell the rental property or use it as my primary residence since it's too small for me and my kids. 

Since interest in residential property is now capped on mortgages up to $750k, while business mortgage interest is not, should I refinance the rental for a higher $, taking out money from it to pay down more on the primary residence and result in larger business mortgage, more business int exp, less business income to be taxed?  

(BTW, I haven't done my own taxes in the dozen years we've been married, so forgive me if I'm wrong on the TCJA tax provisions and any updates $ limits; however I used to be a CPA from first job out of college, but been out of that discipline for almost 25 years, so can mostly hold my own on finances after I catch back up).",Yes,Yes,No,No,Yes
j3z4dq,lljc00,"How much do I need to earn to afford a house (SF Bay Area)?

How much do I need to earn to afford a $700,000 mortgage?

TLDR: Why are my annual numbers so off from my monthly numbers?  Is 4X borrowing estimate too conservative (or meant for people who have expensive lifestyles)?

I'm in the process of getting divorced, 2 elementary school aged kids.  Haven't worked in 10 years, but when I did, I was making $120K in tech.  Probably can't do that job again because of the commitment level, but a related job made \~$100K in 2010 dollars (any guesses what that might earn today??)

Homes in the area I want to buy are around $1.5M.  Mind you, these aren't for great homes (ugly 60's ranch houses), but the neighborhood and schools are good.  I'm thinking after the settlement, I would have $800K to put down (53%).  So with a remaining mortgage of $700K, would I be needing to bring home $175K gross using a 4X (4 times salary) estimate?

Now, I know not all of that would need to come from my earned salary.  I estimate I'll get child support of around $3,000 per month, which would equate to being about $48K of salary ($3,000 x 12 = $36,000 net, =appx $48K before taxes at effective tax rate of 25%, for purposes of getting numbers in ""gross"" terms, since not taxed on child support).  So does that leave me at needing to get a job of around $127K?

Here are numbers in gross/annual calculations:

|$700,000|Mortgage|
|:-|:-|
|$175,000|Needed ""Income"" using 4X borrowing rate|
|$48,000|Child support (annualized, and adjusted into before tax gross equivalent)|
|$127,000|Needed income from job|

&amp;#x200B;

Here are numbers in monthly, assuming $700K mortgage at 3%

&amp;#x200B;

|$2,953|Principle and interest|
|:-|:-|
|$1,406|Prop tax (zillow estimate, but I think it should be more like $1000)|
|$67|Insurance (zillow estimate, but is probably should be a little more??)|
|$4,426|Total to service the house|
|$3,000|Child Support|
|$1,426|Amount needed after paying for food, utilities, etc|
|$2,500|My estimate needed of take home (paying for food, utlities, etc).  I'm a pretty conservative spender and can eat top ramen for 5 years if I had to ;-)|
|$3,333|Estimate of Gross (using 25% effective tax rate)|
|$40,000|Annualized salary|

So by the monthly, I should have no problems.  But by the annual, I really need a very well paying job.  What am I missing in these calculations?  Is 4X too conservative in the Bay Area (and esp for me, given I am a low risk defaulter with 50%+ down).  I know that child support wont all go to housing, of course.  So, say that $40K job needs to be an $80K job.  But still.  $80K job vs $127K+ job - big difference.

And if the Annual calculations are more realistic, are my 40 something neighbors really making that much money?  Or do they too have so much money to put down?  Example is a family from our kids' school that lives in house bought for $1.2 (worth $2M now).  Dad works in insurance (so, non tech, no options).  Mom doesn't work.  Assuming they put $240K down, taking on a $960K mortgage would have needed to be making  close to $200K using an aggressive 5x multiplier, or $320K using a conservative 3x multiplier.  And that would have been 10+ years ago when they bought the house.

What am I missing?!?",No,Yes,No,No,Yes

Which, as I write this, I guess isn't so bad, but I suppose there's comparing that at 12 months and $36,000 if I were to summon all my strength and remain in residence until I could close on something (we are already in separate bedrooms; just not sure how contentious we'll get in negotiations). 

So let's use the $36,000 instead. Is it really that bad to throw away $36,000 in rent, when if you think about what you throw away in the undeducted portion of interest and property tax in the first years of a mortgage anyway?

j8yqxw,lljc00,"Govt or corporate job (pension vs 401k)

I (50 F, SF Bay Area) am about to get divorced and need to look for a new job. I have only worked in private corporations and have a sizable amount ($1.3m) in retirement accounts which is protected to me because it's spelled out in our prenup. The money is in Roth IRAs (both accounts I established as Roth as well as ones I rolled over from 401ks when I left the companies) and traditional IRAs. I need the job more for healthcare, property taxes and so I'm not cash flow negative (and peace of mind of course). But I think I'll be in a good position after settlement that I don't have to find the highest paying job I could potentially get to live the modest life that I do. 

I'm thinking of looking for a job in city government for the following reasons. 1) might find meaningful work if I am able to get a particular job that I'm interested in doing 2) lifestyle (don't want to be working 50-60 hrs a week, need to be able to have some flexibility to pick up my kids after school who are 9 and 12 (not sure if gov't would be more flexible enough)  and 3) (main reason for posting) opportunity for pension to diversify my retirement sources.

j9so7a,lljc00,"Is mortgage interest on rental property more like a tax ""credit"" than a deduction?

Sometimes people seem to make a (false) argument that paying residential mortgage interest is good (vs none) because you get a deduction on it (let's assume you are itemizing and not taking standard deduction because we are talking large amounts in the expensive SF Bay Area real estate market). I describe it as ""false"" because, while yes you get a deduction, you still had to pay it. 

So if you pay $30,000 in interest, you out-lay cash of $30,000. On your tax return, you claim the deduction $30,000, lowering tour taxable income by $30,000, thus saving you $7,500 (assume 25% tax rate). So it's as if you ""only"" paid out $22,500. But compared to no mortgage, you're still out $22,500.  (And when I say ""some people"" make this argument, I don't mean the fine people of personalfinance of Reddit, of course. I mean my husband ...)

Does the same apply for mortgage interest on rental property?  Assume the rental is cash flow positive. Does it make sense to pay down the mortgage (if you can) and avoid interest despite being able to use it to offset rental income (because you still have to outlay the cash and only receive some benefit for reduction of taxable income)?  Or is it better to keep some interest expense to offer the rental income?  

And for the sake of the question, let's not assume any other opportunity cost of what you'd use the money for otherwise, whether interest rates are super low or high, or what tax bracket you are in. 

So probably my title should be ""Is mortgage interest on rental property more/less/equally valuable as residential mortgage interest from a tax perspective?""",Yes,Yes,No,Yes,No
jffxbe,lljc00,"Buy, refi, payoff oh my!

TL;DR What should I payoff or not pay off, and in what order, so I can buy the best primary residence I can afford after divorce.

I (50F) am in the process of getting divorced after 13 years, 2 elementary aged kids, SF Bay Area, Credit Score around 840 (I have credit cards in my maiden name that won't be disrupted with divorce).  I have:

$750,000 FMV 1BR/1BA Rental House (protected by pre-nup), rental income $2500.

\-$94,000 remaining mortgage on Rental House, about 7 more years left, 3.125%, monthly is $1500 (really $1390, but I put extra toward principle)

\-$6,000 remaining balance on student loan debt, about 5 years left, 2.125%, monthly is $125.

$100,000 very liquid cash

$300,000 investment accounts, not as liquid, but still pretty liquid

$1.3m retirement accounts (protected by pre-nup)

$1.0m estimate of net settlement.  This is a complete SWAG, but lets use it for purposes of this discussion.  Also assume the $100,000 and $300,000 are also the ""cleared"" amount after settlement - meaning my take away is $1+.1+.3 = $1.4m.  I list them here separately to show my liquidity position (whether that's valid or not, I'm not sure).

I will need to retitle the rental house, and hopefully soon after settlement, buy a primary residence for my kids and me.  Estimate that this will be around $1.2m-$1.4m depending on fixer or move in-able condition.

Also I should add that I am not employed, but will be looking for a job probably starting in January.  I think I can easily get a job for $70,000 that gives me flexibility to pick the kids up after they are back in school, but if I really put myself back into my previous ambitions, I can probably get a $120,000 job.  But I don't really want that because I had no spare time with that job, and I really need that now as I expect to have more than 50% responsibility (if even only 50% custody; mom job, right?).  So let's assume $70,000, and let's assume $3500 take home per month.

I expect $3000 in child support (no alimony - pre-nup :-(  ).  That could go lower depending on the job I get.

Rental property rents for $2500, but say $2000 after considering property taxes.  Mortgage payment is $1500 with the current mortgage.

&amp;#x200B;

So, what should be my ordered plan once everything is settled?  Here are the things that can/should happen:

* Refinance Rental or just pay off Rental?
* Pay off student loan
* Buy primary residence

I'm wondering whether it makes sense to just pay off the rental vs refinance and have to pay closing costs/fees (I don't even know what that might amount to - $3000 in administrative paperwork, $1000 in origination fees?).  But I'd hate to lose the cash to put toward the primary residence.  I know I can cash-out refi this property (say, to put towards the primary), but I believe that I lose any tax deductibility of the mortgage interest since the funds wouldn't be put toward that property.

Should I just pay off the student loan to make sure I don't have any dings for existing debt?  Or will that make me look worse for ""closing"" an account?

For the primary residence, I'm thinking of buying at the low end whatever I can buy with all cash (meaning a fixer).  Then after I get a steady stream of income, do a cash out refi and remodel it.  So potentially buy $1.2, then take out, say $250,000 in the future to remodel.  So my LTV would still be very favorable to any bank.

On the other hand, a $1.2-$1.4 means usually 1,200 sq ft, and I'd really like to get a few hundred more sq ft to be able to carve out an office space, so I'd like to be more in the $1.5-1.6m range.  Can I get a loan using child support and rental income (14 year rental history) alone?  ($1.5m would still be fixer upper for something around 1,400 sq ft - sad, I know, and no, I'm not moving out of the area; this is home now.)

Should I look to buy the primary before doing anything on the rental so I don't have multiple transactions on my record, meaning either less to possibly borrow or a higher interest rate?  I know this probably wont be an option since 1) need to retitle shortly after settle (but say I had 6 months to do so; what should I want/ask for in settlement?) and 2) may take a while to find the right house.  But if the stars aligned and I did my timing right, would it be better to transact the primary residence first before the rental property?

Most of my money (retirement) is held in accounts with Fidelity.  I will shortly get a large sum of money when my divorce is finalized.  I am not employed, though will be looking for work shortly.

Planning to buy a new house following a divorce. I'm asset rich, income poor (but plan to get a job not to distant future). Credit score 840. I have two outstanding loans which are (in the grand scheme) not that much and not much time left on them.

w4i0bv,lljc00,"Traditional vs Roth IRA - a different take on the argument, specifically with a 401k rollover

So, I understand the argument and get the math that if your tax bracket today vs at retirement are exactly the same, then it makes no difference whether you put your equivalent money in a traditional IRA (using the pre-tax amount) vs a Roth IRA (using the smaller after-tax amount).  I'm probably incomplete with that description, but hopefully you know the oft discussed argument I'm referring to.

But I think there's an argument to be made for preference for a Roth IRA when rolling over from a 401k (and assume you have 5-10 years of contributions built up).  With a 401k rollover, doesn't it make more sense to put the whole thing into a Roth IRA because 

1. there isn't a pre-tax vs post-tax with this money since you aren't supposed to touch it\*, lest you incur the 10% penalty.  Also assume you pay taxes with money from your checking/savings/brokerage account. 
2. you aren't often given this opportunity to contribute to a Roth at this amount.  On top of that, you got to put in a lot more money into your 401k per year over the 5-10 years than an IRA.  (FWIW, I don't know anything about backdoor Roth, so if this is what I'm describing, well then I guess we got to the same conclusion.)

\*If I'm wrong about this, then, yes, if you use some of the 401k funds to pay the taxes, I guess the argument is same as what I opened with.  Though 2 is still ""Here's a great opportunity to maximize a post-tax contribution, don't blow it""

Presumably this is the maturity of the basket of the underlying t-bills. No big deal about the per-share ""decrease"" because you get the interest payout about a week later. (i.e. you aren't really ""losing"" because you have the $0.15 cash back in your account.)

Is SHY not exactly like the underlying treasury because the underlying note that's paying 4% isn't going to be distributing that interest until 2024-2025? So what's getting distributed today are the interests on the ones bought 1-3 years ago (and I presume at a much lower rate)?

z4qckn,lljc00,"Buy house all cash? Cash out refi to invest in stocks?

First, let me start by just saying this is for discussion purposes.  So hear me out before you just answer with a ""no"".  Also, assume this is when interest rates are stable and neither too high nor too low.  I guess we can use 5-6% since that is historically a comfortable rate I think many can't argue too much with.

Whenever someone asks ""Should I cash out the equity in my house to invest in stocks"" the answer is a very scolding ""No!""  Security of paid off house, blah, blah.  

On the other hand if someone took 90% of their life savings and bought a house all cash (leaving 10% for repairs and emergencies and what not"", that would be also ""Stupid"".  Leverage, historical investment returns 7% &gt; appreciation \~5%, blah, blah.

So say you have $500k (after taxes on any gains, of course, and say this is in your non-retirement accounts, where the size of your retirement accounts are just OK, call it 80% of ideal for your age), and a house you want to buy is $450k.  Let's say it's a couple of weeks ago, and borrowing rates were &gt;7%.  And you think, well, that sucks (imagine how much that would suck if rates were 14%+ like in the 70's).  Do you just buy the house outright with $450k?  But then you have pretty much no money left invested to grow.  But you have all this equity in the house.  So say rates drop to 4-5%.  Do you cash out some of that and invest in stocks?  

Is there really any difference between 

* Paying all cash initially and then cashing out to invest in stocks 
* Leaving most cash in stocks and taking on debt

The end result is sort of the same, just different steps to get there as well as the psychological ""bird in the hand"" of a fully-paid house and then subsequently going into debt.  Let's ignore taxes for this discussion (say mortgage interest deduction doesn't provide much benefit over standard deduction).

(I know there's probably a timing aspect to consider because if rates were 7%+ today, they probably aren't dropping to 4% next month.  Tho, what if they did?)

Neither extreme (all-cash 0% financed vs no-down 100% financed) is ideal.  But where is the line?  Is it a line that changes as you age?  Does it change based on interest rates?  Does it change when the $ is higher and mortgage interest deduction comes back into play?",Yes,Yes,No,Yes,No

I'm 39 next week (married w/4yo kid). I made a lot of stock/options mistakes in the last 1.5 years and lost hundreds of thousands of dollars. This was money I could not afford to lose and my family obviously been adversely impacted by this and I'm trying to set things right.

&amp;#x200B;

First off,, I've come to terms with the fact that I will no longer be doing any type of active stock/options/crypto trading whatsoever, probably for the rest of my life, and looking at what I can do to rebuild in a responsible way. I realize that just like the alcohol and drugs I kicked 13 years ago, I am \*not\* able to participate in active money management and I need to simply abstain for the sake of myself and my family. It has been a very tough time.

My main question is now that I have an enormous carryover loss,  should I bother with any 401k or IRA contributions above what my employer matches? Aside from the possible psychological barrier of having the money in a retirement fund,  I'm guessing there will be no tax advantage until I am in a spot where I have hundreds of thousands of dollars in capitol gains to realize.

&amp;#x200B;

EDIT:  My employer matches 50 cents on a dollar up to the ""maximum"" , but allows additional Roth contributions on top of that. My retirement savings are behind schedule, so my question is really about \*extra\* contributions above the $20,500 maximum , since my employeer has an extra special awesome 401k with backdoor conversions etc.

I have Trad and Roth contributions in my Fidelity 401k.  I've changed investments several times, and even done ""day trading"" in my account (terrible idea). 

I'm confused as to how my tax liability would be calculated when I retire.  I can only assume that when I retire and start taking distributions, the totality of all Trad vs Roth contributions will be taken into account for each distribution payment,  and so the cost basis, profit/loss of any investment I hold in the 401k has no real significance,all that matters is the total 401k balance, and the proportion of Trad and Roth contributions over the course of the lifetime of the 401k?

m7ggoh,locusofself,"Backdoor Roth IRA and ""pro rata"" rule question

Greetings PF!

Wife has traditional IRA \~$50k. The balance is completely from deductible contributions and their growth.

I am considering a Roth conversion for her. As of 2020 filing we arent eligible for Roth, or Trad deductions.

My understanding (?) is that if I convert the whole thing, it will add the entire balance to our 2021 taxable income. So if our *effective* 2021 tax rate is say 20% , we would owe 10k additional tax next year. 

The tax bill sounds bad, but if this really opens the door to being able to do more back door roth contributions for her each year, this seems like a good idea, especially because I am the higher earner, but she is 6 years older than me, and will be 59.5  in  16.5 years, and I want to retire early.

So provided we stay married forever, it kindof feels like if I pay the $10k to convert to Roth, we can subsequently use the Roth IRA as a tax advantaged account (through conversions) with a 16.5 year time horizon.

Then if I am able to retire at 53, we can start dipping into that,  then later my 401k and my Roth.

Am I understanding this ""pro rata"" rule, that it would just be a 1-time big tax bill for the conversion, but then when we both have only Roth IRAs, we can do backdoor contributions without any further taxes imposed?

&amp;#x200B;

EDIT: Several have pointed out because my wife is self-employed, she can open a solo 401k and roll the IRA into that, then we won't have to deal with the pro rata rule for roth conversions.

All return numbers are from [Moneychimp](http://www.moneychimp.com/features/market_cagr.htm). What else should be included (comment below)?

I created a spreadsheet viewing yearly returns of the S&amp;P 500 from 1900 to 2019 and compared the returns of how an Indexed Universal Life policy can potentially lower your net worth if it is the only tool used to invest. **(Note: This is NOT financial advice, please do your own research)**

For both tools I assume that you have $10,000 to invest and your effective overall tax rate is 25%.

**Assumptions for IUL**

* The average yearly fees of the policy are 0.75%. This included any of the premium load, admin costs, expense, and/or mortality charges. **I understand that with most policies, the fees are mostly front-loaded but this is just for example purposes and this is a fairly low average.**
* The cap is 12% and the floor is 0%
* It is a point to point return, meaning, there are no S&amp;P 500 dividends
* It is post tax money

**Assumptions of 401(k)**

* It is a traditional 401(k) (pre-tax money) but post tax amount is viewable
* The S&amp;P 500 ETF, SPY, is what the money is invested in with a current 0.09% expense ratio
* Dividends are reinvested

**Key Take Aways**

* Average return over various rolling X number of year periods:
   * 40 years: IUL: 7.32%, 401(k): 12.12%
   * 30 years: IUL: 6.60%, 401(k): 12.08%
   * 20 years: IUL: 6.55%, 401(k): 11.83%
   * 10 years: IUL: 6.51% 401(k): 11.52%
* Only in 10 year periods does the average return in an IUL beat the a 401(k). It happened in 8 ten year periods
   * Most recent 10 year period: 2002-2011 where the average return for the IUL was 6.06% where for the 401(k), it was 5.05%",Yes,Yes,No,Yes,No
facqyn,lopeza14,"I am addicted to saving money, how do I learn how to enjoy the money I make?

Hello all, since I was a young kid, I have had this addition to trying to save &amp; invest as much money as possible. Sure, it is a good habit to be a natural saver but I never really learned how to enjoy my money on things I want for things such as hobbies. Admittedly, this has made me very cheap in many areas and to the point where I try to penny pinch as well. This habit is partially due to coming from living with a single parent where some years, we did not have much. Thus, how can I reverse this in some areas? 

Just for some context: I am almost 24 with a \~$75K net worth (had multiple jobs in college and high school which did help substantially and having a decent salary now.

Hi everyone, 

I'll give a little context and I'd like to see others opinions on where im at and if its a good, smart or dumb idea to buy a cabin on the lake. 

I make $58k a year working in sales for Marriott. I still have my job and look to have it moving forward, however we all know how rocky employment is right now, especially in hospitality. 

I own a duplex in the city with a mortgage of about $717 a month all in. The other portion of the duplex produces $1100 a month in rent. So essentially I cash flow $383 a month. 

My other bills run me approximately $683 per month. Totaling $1400 a month in bills and mortgage. 

The cabin would be approximately $1000 all in a month. So my total bills with the cabin would be around $2500 (plus or minus). After the duplex rent we would be down to $1400 out of pocket bills. 

I plan to still contribute 25% to my retirement and also think I can save approximate 21% in my brokerage account. I will also have approximately $20k in emergency fund (or 8 months of expenses)

My plan is to rent the cabin on AirBnB when not in use by me. I figure a conservative 15% occupancy per year (Cool MN climate) at $200 per night will net me $912 per month in rental income. Which could offset the mortgage if done property.

So i live for free and cash flow so, so you can see its a good thing going, however I hate being a landlord and I hate even more being a landlord with my renter downstairs. Also, the property was built in 1890 so lots of issues. My original plan was to live here for a few years to save money for a down payment of another house and then I'd move into that house and rent this full duplex.. I have enough money for a down payment now. If I did that, I could pay for my new house and the duplex mortgage with the rent from the renters. So on the surface it seems like a good idea. I could build wealth at a good rate. However, I do not make a ton of salary so there is a good amount of risk in this. 

**So i have been debating a few options - its been in my mind so much** 

\- Sell this duplex and use the equity and brokerage money to buy a house cash (be the happiest - less risky, however not able to build the most wealth)

\- Keep the duplex, buy another house and rent the entire duplex (make the most money long term - most stress)

\- Sell the duplex, use the equity to invest and just rent for awhile

&amp;#x200B;

I think my biggest problem is I stress over the rental and what may go wrong, what if the renter leaves, blah blah blah. I've been told I over think things a lot. I just see buying my own house to be such a stress reliever, however I am a super saver so optimizing money and making more is important to me. I think selling the duplex could allow me to relieve some stress to find other ways to make more money in other ways. 

What do you guys think? Any advice? Anyone been through anything similar?

Hello, 

I'm trying to figure out if this is a good idea. 

Back story - Single. male, 31 yr old, work from home, make 60k a year, 250k in an investment account, 80k in retirement, 7k in emergency fund, saving 30% gross toward Roth, HSA and 401k. I own a duplex and rent the other side out. I live for free and cash flow about $400 a month. I plan to sell this house. 

I hate owning real estate and want to have a more adventure filled life style and do not want to be a long distance landlord. I do not know where I want to live so this is a way I can test the waters cheaply. My plan is to convert a van into a full time living space. I understand the pros and con, this post is not about that. I'd say ill prob spend at least 2 years if not more living in the van. The van will cost me around 65k paid cash and I will build out myself in the next few months. The conversion will run approx. 15 to 20k and I will cash flow throughout the build. I know there are cheaper ways to do this, but this is what I want. I will still be working full time and investing and living for free while building and travelling. A big concern is that the van will likely depreciate, however my rational is that the difference from what I buy the van to what I eventually sell it at will be what the memories are worth to me.

oo20xa,mado0801,"Real estate tax question

I was hoping you could assist with a tax question regarding my rental property. I'm looking to sell a property (duplex) I inherited in Dec 2018. I rented both units from March 2019 until Jan 1st 2020. I moved into the other unit Jan 1st 2020 and continued to rent the second unit, which is still rented. I'm still living here as well. I refinanced the property in Feb 2020 as a primary residence. 

The realtor says I can list for $250k to $275k. I owe $86k. When my family member passed I got an appraisal at time of death, which was appraised for $195k. 

I'm hoping you all can assist me with explaining how I can sell this property the most tax efficient way. From my understanding, if you live in the property for 2 years you can have a gain of $250k tax free as a single person.

oo82q0,mado0801,"What are the negatives to my plan?

Hi everyone, 

I inherited a duplex 2 years ago. I refinanced and its now in my name with a low rate. I live in the top unit (could rent for $900) and I current do rent the bottom at a monthly rent of $1150. The monthly payment (with insurance and taxes included) is $700 a month. I owe 86k and its worth approximately 270k. I like real estate and the cash flow on the property is good and my personal investment is basically nothing aside from some renovations ive done totaling around $8k. The area is in an up and coming area with large investments in building and infrastructure. So I could see appreciation being higher than the norm. 

However, I do not want to live here. Instead I want to buy a single family house for myself and keep this rental and rent both sides. The house I would buy is approximately $250k-$275k. I have 65k for 20% down and 10k for closing costs. In addition, I have 80k in retirement, 20k in emergency fund and 15k in an investment account. I'm 31 yrs old and make 57k a year. I have no debt other than the mortgage stated above.

If I buy this single family house, my monthly bills will be $2700, including both mortgages. With the total of $2050 coming in from rent, my monthly bills will be reduced to $650. 

Do you guys think I am okay to make this move? If not, what should I do to improve? I understand the risks involved (tenant not paying, destroying property, etc.) but in my mind its a risk im willing to take in order to move out of the current duplex. I want my space, but I dont really want to sell the duplex because it cash flows so well. It seems like a no brainer to keep it.

Hello, 

I am 31 yrs old. Single. Make 57k per year. Have 275k in brokerage account. 80k in retirement. 20k in emergency fund. Currently save about $2200 a month (retirement and in brokerage account)

I want to buy a house worth approximately 275k - it may take a few months so in those few months I'll save for the closing costs to pay cash either way. 

My question is should sell the investments in my brokerage account to pay cash for the house? Or should I only put 20% down, which would leave me with about 210k in the brokerage account. If I pay cash - house payment would be $350 (taxes and insurance) if I dont pay cash payment would be about $1200  (about 25% of my gross). 

If I pay cash, savings rate is higher but initial investments much lower. Plus rates are so low. I've ran the numbers and in the long run paying only 20% will allow me to accumulate much more money. I understand not paying cash is taking on more risk.

So far she is actively interviewing at large cities (where I dont want a car) and got into a rural area in colorado (where I do). She will know exactly where she will be going in March/April.

So fast forward to last Wednesday, I hit a deer on the freeway and total my car. So now Im in a weird situation where I don't want to commit to a car Im unsure if I will need in 9 months, but also need a car within the next month or so. Whats the most reasonable option both financially and practically?

Financially I'm not strained (within reason). I've been preping or this moment and have $20k in cash ready to deploy as needed. Short term leases look appealing, but sound expensive

I apologize if the simplicity of my question is offensive to you.

I read that Apple is around 2 trillion in value, losing 1 trillion in 12 months. It got me thinking. So, is the following thought correct based on a fictional firm:

If ABC is valued 10 million, because it has 5 million shares, each at a 2 $ price. The very last buy trade determines the final value of the entire company. so here someone paid 2$ and made ABC worth 20 million.

So itâ€™s just the last trade that â€ždecidesâ€œ for the time being what the entire company is worth.

A friend of mine is opening a podiatry business. There is a massive shortage here as itâ€™s not just cosmetic but also medical. Thatâ€™s why he will be profitable from the start. 

He receives 150k as a loan on a 6,4% interest  over 10 years to buy equipment etc.

He will make revenue of 250k in first year, 270k in second and probably stay on that level for 3 more years, maybe add 10-15k every year. After all expenses, taxes and salaries the remaining liquidity is 35k a year that can stay in the firm.

My question. In this context and all variables being stable, Would you pay back the loan quicker than 10 years? It seems the business growth is less than 6,4% so it would make sense?!

Hello all,

I have been thinking about investment opportunities which will be massive in the future (10+ years). So companies in their baby shoes, being cheap too, which will boom massively. I have identified following themes:


Psychedelics - It becomes more and more obvious that depression, PTSD etc. can be treated with such. I believe it will play massive part in future health care

Cannabis - Once the US makes it legal on federal level the market will explode

Lab Meat - For environmental, ethical and efficiency reasons future meat will be produced in a lab

space travel - if you can spend a reasonable amount of time in space for a reasonable price, you will do so. Even if itâ€™s a stretch.

uqt2lv,Many-Coach6987,"Why is making/having debt positive under inflation?

Dear community,

It bothers me that I cant grasp a seemingly fundamental thing, which is, that under strong inflation having or making debt is good. So maybe it helps if I tell you quickly my situation:

- My wife and me make around 250k a year, being engineers
- We bought a place for 700k two years ago and still have around 400k in debt to pay

Now our goal was always to pay off the remaining 400k asap, so I have this ballast off my shoulder and we could be done in 6 years max. Then, being debt free I figured I could live more freely, investing the then higher savings (from not paying the mortgage anymore) into whatever. But mostly not being under the pressure of having debt.

I have issues, while understanding the theory, to see the positive in practice. I â€žfeelâ€œ that my grocery bill is now 10% higher than months ago because of inflation . I feel that in my wallet that I have to pay more for the same. Thatâ€™s negative.

But I donâ€™t â€žfeelâ€œ the positive impact on inflation on having debt. I know(or maybe I donâ€™t) that debt must be worth less under inflation. But I cant recognise this.

I was advised to not pay off the debt asap because of inflation, I just donâ€™t seem to get it. To be fair, as an engineer, economics was not part of my classes.

Hello,

I'm not sure if this the correct sub. I have a CPA and my business has been open since September 2022. I can't figure out what to do now that my business is open. My CPA doesn't really answer my questions about signing up for healthcare. He probably doesn't have to but I'm thinking I can sign up for healthcare through the marketplace, is this correct? Would it be a tax write off? 

Do I need a CPA or financial planner?

I'm 32 and opened a Roth last year for the first time. I plan to max it out but that's all I have. I have $1k remaining to max out. Emergency fund is $2k. I have $35k from my business and no other debts, except mortgage. My goal is to continue to utilize the $35k to continue to build my business. My goal is to get $100k. My mortgage and bills are paid by the VA.

I'd like to start planning for retirement but I'd also like to have more money put away for the business, like the $100k. As a business owner can I create a 401k for myself? And if so, how do I go about doing this? Is it too early?

oo460l,Maxine_Shaw,"How to Pay off Debt to obtain Dream Home?

Between my partner and I, we make $140k. We would like to build our dream home but we have a few roadblocks to getting there and we are trying to figure out the best way to get there.

Breakdown: I have $125k in student loan debt, $18k remaining on our vehicle, my partner he has no debt. We have no other debts besides our home which we plan on selling once the dream home is built. We have no children. Our mortgage is paid monthly and we put out $770 in mandatory spending in addition to our mortgage, totaling $2,270.00. However, we only have $5k in savings, no 401k (which we are planning on maxing out each year since I just started working) and no other investments. We are learning how to change this, we have no outside help. When we put the house up for sale, we are estimating that we could make $120k-160 profit off of the sale of the house. We would like to start the build on the dream house in 3-4 years. Of course, the earlier the better. How can we achieve our dream faster?

No matter the plan we end up deciding on, we are going to max out our 401k. Question: Can 401k be combined? Are there ""additional"" benefits to combining spouse 401k or should they be kept separate for tax reasons?

Should we (in conjunction with maxing out the 401k):

A) Pay off the car first and then the student loans while saving money for the dream home? If so, while paying these things off, how much should we be putting away in savings?


B) Pay off the car, make the minimum payments on the student loans and put the rest of the money towards our dream home? The student loan payments would last longer in this scenario. 

C) Have my partner pay into the 401 independently for sometime while also putting money into savings. I pay the car off and put all of my money towards my student loans ($5k a month) and pay off the student loans in 25 months? And then we both tackle the 401k to max out and then combined we can put away about $7k a month after taxes. 

We would like to have atleast $250k saved for the dream home but or course, the more money the better.  


EDIT: We are estimating that it would cost $500k to build the dream house.

rk9909,Maxine_Shaw,"Buying or Building a House in this Market

We need to move but the cost of buying a house is so insane right now. This leads me to my dilemma. We were planning on building our dream home in a few years (estimate of $500k, no more) but need to move from our current home because of the influx of crime. It is no longer a matter of ""if"" but a matter of ""when"" we will become the victim of crime. We were trying to hold out as long as we could because our mortgage right now is $1100. Unfortunately we are going to have to move and so we are planning on putting the house up for sale over the summer, we should be able to make $100k off of our home. We spent the weekend looking at homes and a decent home in any area costs about $350k and up. The housing market is insane right now so I won't go into detail about that.

We have no CC debt, only my student loans and one car payment, nothing else. We will have $50k in savings by the time we put the house up for sale this summer, no kids, and with the sell of the home, we could easily have $100k so $150k total. We discussed putting the $100k into the next home but I've been debating if we should just go ahead and have the dream house built and put the $100k towards that or keep it and invest it and eventually put the next home up for sale while we continue to save money? Financially, what would be the best move? We will be using a the VA home loan so we would not need a down payment. 

I feel like, since the cost of a decent home is $350k and we are going to take out a loan anyway, that we mine as well get the dream house built now because we would be more than halfway there with a loan that high with a home we don't really want. 

I'd like to make the best financially smart move here. We aren't sure what goes into building a home but I'm sure it can get expensive pretty quick. I just want to make the right decision here.

Hello everyone!

I left my employer and I am now trying to figure out what to do with the funds from my 401k. I know I need to roll them over but I don't know how (this is my first time) I should go about it. Currently I have $4211.xx in my Roth IRA with VTSAX. I have a brokerage account and traditional IRA, both of these accounts have a zero balance at Vanguard.

vhf0ov,Maxine_Shaw,"Student Loans vs Life

I'd like some input but I ""think"" I know what to do.

I (31F) have $125k in student loan debt. My biggest headache of it comes from two loans from grad programs, one $25k and the other $20k. The one with $25k has the highest interest and I plan on tackling this first and then the other $20k. After this the loan balances range from $7k to - $2k and I'll be able to breathe easier. The interest is small on the remaining loans so I'm not entirely worried about them but will pay them off as quickly as possible.

Debts: None besides student loans and mortgage.

Monthly expenses: $1500 for bills and food (mainly food, used to cost $600 now its up to $1000 and we eat at home). VA income $1650, mortgage $2100. Spouse $4k monthly. 

I'd like to put away all of my checks from my job once I start working, saving $5k to pay off the $25k loan when my student loan payments begin in October. I can do it, I'd be sacrificing living but at this point it's worth it.

Retirement accounts: Roth IRA $4k. I just started being able to save for retirement in April. $3k in savings after house emergency costing $15k.

Job: Start date is next month, $90k a year. 401k option is available though I am not sure when I can begin to participate. I will find out.

My situation: I am in the healthcare field, work is steady and bad employers are rapidly spreading. I'm in the process of opening my own practice and have a growing waitlist of clients and people that would love to work for me. I'm hoping to keep the job I landed for a minimum of 6 months but would prefer a year to save additional money for the business and try to pay off the loans. I'd like to work my job and continue to grow my practice until I am too busy to work my normal job.

Since the remaining loans are smaller in interest I am planning to pay them off once I am more financially secure (basically when ny practice is steady). 

Tax deductions: Besides the 401k is there anything I could do to lower my taxable income? I don't have any dependents. Can I put two dependents on my w-4 for my employer to get more of my money upfront and then pay the tax bill later? I'd be okay with this as long as I can pay off the high interest loan. It has gained almost $5k in interest since I got it a few years ago. 

My questions/concerns:

Is this a good plan? Does it seem too extreme? Should I put money back into thr emergency fund when I start working? Would investing help me pay off the loans quicker? Should I contribute to my 401k while I am trying to pay off the $25k loan?

After a tough first 7 or 8 years of my career, I made a complete career change and I'm currently at an amazing company making $200k. I'm a top performer with much growth in career and income in the future.

Now that I've paid off some debt and rebuilt my emergency funds, my mind is back on how to build my wealth/passive income as much as possible so one day, sooner than later, will not need my job, although I may still choose to work if I want to.

Our 401k match is 50% for every dollar up to the limit and the Employee Stock Purchase Plan is a 10% look back provision (company is a blue chip teach stock) using up to 15% of each paycheck.

I've also always been interested in growing my wealth and passive income by investing in real estate. Initially I wanted to buy single family homes for rent, then move to multi-family. Now, after seeing one my friends have a ton of success, I'm considering starting with renting units for the purpose of furnishing them and putting them on airbnb/vrbo/etc. at least to start and eventually buying homes to rent.

As of right now, because I live in a HCOL area, and I needed to rebuild my emergency fund, although I'm able to save a bit, I'm not in a position to sock away a ton in the 401k, ESPP, and invest in real estate, so I was wondering, what would be the best one to focus on or best combination?",Yes,Yes,No,No,No

I know that as a beginning investor you should only have about 5 to 10% of your portfolio in stocks and the other 85 to 90% you can have it in ETF for mutual funds. 

But my question is: 

1. If I have no more than 10 stocks in my portfolio that make up 10-15% of my total investing amount does it matter what category theyâ€™re in if I am still investing in ETFs for the other 85-90%? Or should I have a stock that is in each category such as energy and healthcare, etc.

2. Charles Schwab or Fidelity? I researched both of them and they are pretty similar but I am confused on the $72,000 threshold that Fidelity has. Supposedly, The Fidelity Personalized Planning & Advice account becomes more expensive than the Schwab account once you pass the $72,000 threshold. Do they mean the $72,000 money invested as principal or the amount your ira account grows to be up to?

3. I want to open up an IRA that is Roth by the end of the year and I am in between Charles Schwab and Fidelity.

I mean youâ€™d be living modestly and not out there traveling like you should during the last 20-30 years of your life. But what if I donâ€™t want that? I just recently got involved with my investment journey and have asked ALOT of questions just to come to the following conclusion:

1. Work as hard as you can to achieve as much as you can contribute to your retirement accounts without sacrificing your â€œfun moneyâ€ or your sinking fund money. Itâ€™s possible but you just need to work harder.

2. To give more in a retirement account but not sacrifice other line items on your budget, you gotta work 2-3x as hard. Whether it be side hustles, real estate, a small portion of your income going to a brokerage account - youâ€™re young and can do it.

3. Worse case scenario if I canâ€™t contribute more than 15% (which is highly unlikely cuz as time goes on and education grows, you can negotiate pay rates and/or find freelance jobs/side hustles to benefit in your favor) I can always live frugally as I learned to live from birth to 21 when I got my first job.

17tr4p9,merc97,"Does the Rent vs. Buy equation factor in tax savings from mortgage + SALT deduction (for high earners)?

Many rent vs. buy calculators are heavily favoring renting right now, with interest rates where they are. 

However, does this take into account the tax savings from mortgage and state and local taxes? 

For example, I am in the 32% federal tax bracket and live in a high-tax state where my state & local tax rate is 10%+, for a marginal tax rate of ~42%. 

On a $650,000 loan @7%, you would pay $45,000 in interest annually. If you deducted that amount, plus $10,000 for state and local taxes, you would reduce your by roughly $41,000 after accounting for removal of the standard deduction. 

Net net, this would save an additional $17,220 per year in income taxes compared to renting. 

Effectively, that makes your â€œnetâ€ interest rate around 4.3%. Would this be factored in to the â€œrent vs buyâ€ equation?",Yes,Yes,No,No,No

I had a screening call with a recruiter at a startup. I know Iâ€™m a very strong candidate and the call went really well. 

Then, at the end, he asked me about what I wanted for compensation. I said that it would depend on the base/bonus structure etc and asked if he had a range. He replied and told me the exact salary, and the total comp is exactly the same as I make now. 

In response, I said I was excited about the opportunity but it was similar to my current salary and Iâ€™d hope to see a bit of a bump, and said a range 15-20% higher as an ideal. He then got hostile and we had a kind of aggressive back and forth; he was like â€œso would you want to talk to the Director or not? Are you happy with the salary or not??â€ I repeated the same thing in response and sent a nice thank you email.

I make a good 6-figure income and could conceivably save for a down payment and afford the mortgage on a nice 1 bedroom apartment (in the $650-800k range).

But owning an apartment in NYC just seems like such a hassle in terms of being responsible for taxes, maintenance, potentially a co-op board, etc etc. And not having the freedom to move around when I want to experience a different neighborhood.

I definitely see NYC as being my home base for the rest of my life. And the good renters' rights laws in NYC make renting not too bad... in general, you won't be dealing with some small-time landlord who doesn't let you hang things on the walls and harasses you constantly. 

But I have this weird feeling that if I don't own property, I will never be truly secure even if I build wealth in other ways. Or that in a place like NYC, the cost of rent will always go up a lot (unless you secure a stabilized apartment).

Hi All! I'm trying to get my personal finance in check and one of the things I want to do to curb my spending is have a secondary debit card for my everyday use. I know the whole credit vs debit debate especially with rewards and security but I'm also trying to get my debt down and I know using a debit card will help. Instead of linking a debit card to my main bank and my main checking, I'm looking to have a secondary debit card that I will load with say $200 for a few weeks and use that as my main source for day to day purchases. But what would you recommend? 

From my research:

\- Charles Schwab: no foreign transaction fees and rates, and reimbursed ATM fees. This seems more catered for overseas use though may be useful stateside if I need cash quickly from any ATM

\- Discover Debit: 1% back on all purchases

\- Venmo &amp; Cash App: Seems to have rewards and maybe useful among friends

jcof04,MichaelMidnight,"Better Checking Account: Charles Schwab Or Ally

So I'm trying to get my finances into a better system for the remainder of 2020 and especially going into 2021. My plan is this: I have a Chase Checking account that I get my paycheck deposited into. I have this as my base place where my funds get deposited to and so I have a physical place to goto if I need cash instantly. 

From there, I'll move funds to an Ally Savings Account. But I also want a second ""main"" checking account since my Chase one will be used to receive deposits and pay bills. I'm not envisioning on a big deposit every month but more a steady $100 or $200 and grow from there. And that's the basis of my question: should I have it at Schwab or at Ally? 

With Schwab I do like how I can use any ATM, since fees will be covered. But with Ally, I could always transfer money from my Savings to my Checking if I needed an influx of cash and just take it from an ATM. Also on an APY level, Schwab offers .03% while Ally offers .60%.

Hi all, I'm wondering if anyone can provide me some thoughts on this question.

I currently have some stocks in with Ally and checking account with Charles Schwab. I value customer service and simplicity and I sort of want an all encompassing service. So I'm torn between Ally and Schwab for banking.

I'm not looking really for a high yield savings account, what with how interest rates are and will continue to be but I'm wondering if I'm just looking for a savings account to grow an emergency fund before investing, does it even matter where I place the funds?

My main credit card is with Amex, so I'm wondering about their savings account as well. 

But since I have an Investors Checking Account with Charles Schwab - did it for the atm fee free feature - and since I might move my stocks from Ally to them, wouldn't it not be prudent to also move my savings account to them as well?

And the alternative would be to have everything with Ally instead, savings, checking, and stocks.

Before receiving the offer (and assuming Iâ€™d move back home and start job seeking after the internship ends) I planned on taking $6k out of my savings and putting it in VTSAX, and Iâ€™ve also taken $300 out of each paycheck so that by the time my last internship paycheck comes in Iâ€™ll have set aside enough to pay off my school loans, and I planned on paying that off after I move back home. 

Iâ€™ll be receiving a sign on bonus of $12k with this job offer and an $85k salary, and Iâ€™m wondering if thereâ€™s any reason to wait a month or two and just do the VTSAX and paying off school loans with part of that money, or if I should stick to my original plan of using part of my savings. Honestly thereâ€™s no â€œgoodâ€ reason to wait; I just love seeing my savings go up, and taking out $9k will put a damper in that number, which hurts my soul. 

Any thoughts on this?",,,,,

My girlfriend and I (both 24) talk about moving in together but we both agree that we want to be smart about it financially. Iâ€™m not really sure what that meansâ€¦ 

Weâ€™re both from Nebraska and Iâ€™m currently doing a coop at a company in kansas, which ends this week. After that, Iâ€™ll move back in with my parents for a month and a half (to finish my CS degree) and then Iâ€™ll move back out here to start at the same company full time. Iâ€™ll be making $85k + 12k sign on bonus. I currently have $21k, with 19k of that in savings. I plan on investing $6k of the sign on bonus into VTSAX, and using another $2700 to pay off all my student loans, and maximizing my 401k which I believe the company matches 12.5%. I have no debt otherwise (outside of a CC which I always pay the day the bill is available). Up till now, my parents pay for my phone, car insurance, etc. Iâ€™m sure Iâ€™ll start paying for those things after I start my job. I use YNAB for budgeting and Iâ€™m pretty frugal and love to see my savings balance go up.

She doesnâ€™t have a college degree and currently works at a preschool, so sheâ€™ll be able to find a similar job in kansas, but Iâ€™m not sure how likely a higher paying job is. 

Iâ€™m in a very good spot financially, and will continue to be so when I start the full time job, and I try to encourage my girlfriend to start budgeting so we can work towards our goals of living together and everything that comes with that. But Iâ€™m not sure what specific goals we (or she) should have to get there. A certain savings amount perhaps? What else? Any other advice or insights for this situation?",,,,,

I also don't know how much overall I'll need to spend on furniture. I'll probably have to end up using a chunk of my savings for apartment/moving costs and furniture.

I bought a couch for ~$1700, paid 25% of it, and put the rest of it (~$1300) on a CC with the store at 0% for 24 months after delivery. I could pay for it out of pocket, but I'm trying to learn how to use debt effectively, and the general method I'm familiar with is: if you get something with 0% interest, in the meantime put that money somewhere where it will make money for you, and then pay it in full before you ever have to pay any interest.

This is obviously a lot more effective with something like a car loan, since you'll have a lot more money to put somewhere where it will make you money. 

Is it even worth it with something like this? I currently only have a HYSA that I was going to put the money into, but all things said and done, this extra $1300 would only get me like 4 bucks every month. On top of that, I have to make minimum monthly payments so over time that $1300 will slowly decrease. Or I wouldn't touch that $1300 in my savings at all, pay for the minimum payments out of my paycheck (like $30 a month) and then right before the 24 months are up, pay for remaining balance (~$600) either out of that $1300 or potentially each month set aside enough so after 24 months I have the right amount.

Or should I just pay it off as soon as I can and forget about it? Is this amount too small to justify all of this planning and maneuvering?

My parents say I donâ€™t need to worry about credit. I wonâ€™t need credit score because theyâ€™ll co-sign on my first apartment and whatnot, and a credit card wonâ€™t make much of a difference anyways as far as my credit score goes. 

So the question that my mom was wondering, (although Iâ€™m wondering about credit cards in general, not specific to apartments) is â€œwhatâ€™s wiser? Getting a credit card to just build credit as I still live at home, or not worrying about that crap and just let my parents co sign?â€

Hey all,

Been trying to read everything I can about Roth 401k and Traditional 401k and I'm just getting lost in very fine details and rather just post what I need help with and hopefully get some answers.

Currently just started with a new company, as a Sales Manager. So my salary is $90k and my variable (at 100% of my team's quota) is $40k. Let's be conservative and say my annual earnings is $115k (depending on how my team performs and such) plus or minus some. 

**Currently:** 

* I have about $85k in my past employer's 401k, which I will be rolling over to an IRA with Fidelity. 
* I have roughly $2k in HSA, which I am rolling over to Fidelity's HSA account. My new company doesn't have an HSA health plan, so from my understanding, I cannot contribute to an HSA plan and rather get it under one umbrella with Fidelity. 
* I max out my Roth IRA every year with Fidelity - $500 each month
* I currently own a home, so paying a $1350 mortgage 
* Have 6 months emergency fund in an HYSA - and do contribute to that with each paycheck 
* I have money in Crypto and ETFs and contribute the majority of my money after paying bills at the end of the month (I live a frugal life). 

What I need help with - with my income, is it better to invest in Roth 401k or Trad 401k with my company? The match is pretty wack - $1000 a year (it's an early-stage startup). I have read and been told so many different things - all 401k go into Trad or all 401k go into Roth, blah blah blah. I really don't know what will be the best for long-term growth. I am looking to max out my 401k contributions at $19,500 a year. 

As I progress through my career, my salary will only go up (not sure if that matters) but I am not looking at early retirement (unless my crypto goes big in the future). But I see myself working till I am 60 in the corp world. 

Also, by looking at my ""current"" am I missing anything, doing something dumb or should I look into other things? I feel like I am pretty good with my money and the way I spend my money and budget. 

But would love some advice. I really appreciate it.",,,,,

pw2w0v,mjkouris12,"Renting v Selling

Currently own a townhouse in Denver that I bought back in late 2019. Coming up on my 2 years and my gf and I want to buy our own place and move in together outside the city. 

With good timing of 2 years in November, I wouldnâ€™t have to pay capital gains if/when I sell. 

When my gf and I buy, I wouldnâ€™t have to use any of the proceeds I got from selling this place to put the 20% down on the next house. I was going to sell and put it in my ETFs I have now and let it ride. 

I have been asked by a few friends of why not keep it and rent it out. I sorta thought about it but just figured it would be better to sell and collect the gains and move on. 

I have been thinking about selling v renting it out more. 

If I rented, I could make around $500 a month. 

My house has appreciated $100k in the past 2 years.

Hey all,
Needing some help/advice and feedback -

Coming into the new year, making some shifts and adjustments to my investing. 

Recently sold my home and made money and purchased a new home with my significant other. So right now, sitting on a pile of cash. 

Any help/advice would be grateful. 

Current investments: 

Roth IRA - With Fidelity: FZROX and FZILX. 
- Currently sitting at $12k+
- I max this out every year.  
- Being an ROTH IRA, should I leave FZROX &amp; FZILX? I know itâ€™s not transferable but not looking to move. 

HSA - With Fidelity: FZROX - this past year I moved it to Fidelity to invest. 
- Currently sitting at $7k+
- Current company is rolling out a High Deductible plan + HSA, so planning on using that plan and maxing it out. 
- Now that my company is rolling out an HSA plan, can I just add to the Fidelity account? Or do I need to use their plan? 
- Is FZROX a smart play? Or should I get Vanguard ETFs so itâ€™s more transferable? 

401k - With Rivers Edge and now my company is moving to Vanguard. 
- Sitting around $108k
- Invested in 100% Schwab S&amp;P 500
- Since we are moving to Vanguard, planning on rolling over and putting it into VTI / VXUS or just VXUS. Does that split work for 401k?

Brokerage - was with Robinhood but liquidated everything when buying this new house. Planning on reinvesting into Fidelity for long term growth. 
- Will be investing around $150k in lump sum. 
- Sticking with Fidelity thinking with my HSA &amp; ROTH IRA will stay for the foreseeable future. 
- Still thinking long term so want ETFs or something similar. Since Iâ€™m doing Fidelity for the Brokerage, makes more sense to do a Vanguard ETF than a Fidelitys FZROX &amp; FZILX since those two you can transfer. 
- Would I get Fees / does it make sense to get Vanguard ETF - VTI / VXUS? 

Crypto - invest a little here and there in Crypto for high risk / high reward. Using Coinbase. 

Currently : 30 years old, no major debt (mortgage), making about $115k a year. 

Just want to make sure my investments are clear away from fees and since lots of the investments are using the same, does that make sense?

vm1sd6,mjkouris12,"Question around MAGI and Roth IRA.

Beginning of the year on 1/2 I lump summed into my Roth IRA. At that point I was earning $90k base &amp; 40k commission (OTE of 130k). But since thatâ€™s under the 144k MAGI for Roth IRA, it didnâ€™t matter. 

Then a few weeks later they did an market adjustment and bumped my salary up to $106k and commission to be $36k (OTE of $142k). Still under the $144k limit so I wasnâ€™t worried for the year. 

Jump forward to now, I have moved companies and now my base is $140k and $60k commission. 

Which where a few questions come up with ROTH IRAs. 
1. Since I lump summed in the beginning of the year, does it Matter now that I will be in total over the MAGI limit? 

2. If I stay at this company next year, do I have to look at a Back Door Roth since my OTE $200k+? Or since my base is under the limit it wonâ€™t matter?",,,,,

However I'm afraid that might be a bit to conservative and missing out on the \~28% pay out on the company stock. Should I rather just  max out my wifes 401k and then since I have no match not do my 401k and instead put it all into company stock.

qaqy8p,Money_Maketh_Man,"Why doing the backdoor Roth IRA (What are the benefits)

I'm reading a lot on backdoor Roth IRA and I want to be sure I'm getting this correct.

the 6 steps to do it

Step #1: Contribute to traditional IRA 

Step #2: Invest the money in a money market fund.

Step #3: Move money from traditional IRA to Roth IRA (i.e. a Roth conversion).

Step #4: Invest in your preferred investment in the Roth IRA

Step #5: Ensure you have no money in a traditional IRA, SEP-IRA, or SIMPLE IRA on December 31st

Step #6: Report the transactions correctly on your taxes by filling out Form 8606.

&amp;#x200B;

As far as I gathered this is done because Roth IRA is no longer available (to high income) and traditional IRA is not offering tax deductions.  So Both Roth and Traditonal IRA are going to be taxed money, but in the traditional  IRA you get taxed at  distribution as well. Doing the backdoor conversion you are saving the taxes that would otherwise happen at distribution with the Trad IRA ?

Am I on the correct path of understanding or missing out why we do this ?",,,,,

I did our taxes in turbotax and it went fine. Sitting at at 900 dollars return ( guess that technically means i lost an average of 6months of interest on those).  I forgot to check taxable income amount and filed it electronically.

I then noticed our taxable income is at around 86.000, so around 5.000 dollars in the 22% taxbracket. I went and dumped in 5.000 in my Tradional IRA with fidelity, and amended my taxes in turbotax.

In total my investments are around $5000 in Roth 401k, $48,000 in stocks (VOO), and $29,000 in VTI Roth IRA (which I will invest $6,500 at the start of the year). 

My overall expenses are pretty small. I have an escrowed mortgage of roughly $1000. Next biggest expenses are food at $250 and $250 in unknown emergencies (car troubles, house problems, doctor visits, etc.). Then there are small charges here and there that equate to about $800 in total (gasoline, television, internet, gym, etc.). In total, I am spending a little less than I am making including everything. The extra money either goes into an emergency fund or small leisure activities.

11rkpfu,Money_Tough,"Tornado Hit My Land (Uninsured)

I purchased a property in Summer of 2022 with a double-wide trailer on it. There was maybe an acre of clearing with the trailer in it, then 3.5acres of woods. The trailer was pretty bad and was going to be torn down. After getting the location, within 2-months it was hit by a tornado.

I called my insurance seeing if I had anything. They said it canâ€™t be insured as continuation of my property because the trailer was on the land. Then I requested full insurance so I could cut up the trees with friends, they wouldnâ€™t cover because the trailer it beat up from the tornado.

So this leads to my current spot. Found a lumber company that will clean up all the downed trees along with removal of the double-wide (with being insured). This will all be done for free, but they put in the quote to remove all Aspen trees on the property.

The issue is that I donâ€™t know how many Aspens are up there and if I am being scammed. It also feels like I donâ€™t have many options, especially when trying to save money. Thoughts on what I can/should do?",,,,,

Iâ€™m planning on trying to max this out next year (I make $58,000). Is this even a good investment for retirement tho? Looking at the yearly returns, does not seem like much. I want to make sure I invest right before hitting max.",,,,,
ytfhcx,Money_Tough,"Thoughts on Making Money With Credit Card Bonusâ€™s and Bank Bonusâ€™s

My thoughts were to rack up cash by signing up for those credit card bonusâ€™s and only use what I need to achieve them (Gas, Food, mechanic, etc.). Then get into banking bonusâ€™s such as savings/checking accounts and just hold my money in their temporarily until I receive the bonus. 

Doing the math I can get roughly $1200 annually in credit card bonusâ€™s and $1000 in checking/savings. This seems pretty easy (maybe an hour of setting and closing each month). What are the risks/rewards? Thoughts on this or waste of time?",,,,,
z5cv7q,Money_Tough,"My â€œCollege Houseâ€ Is For Sale, Lived there 5 Years Ago. 9-Roomsâ€¦ Should I Purchase?

I remember looking for the easiest and cheapest place to live when I was going to college. I found this place for $285 a month with all utilities included. It was definitely old and dirty, but generally quiet for the amount of people that lived there. Also to say that the rooms were small, but clean. Iâ€™d say 9-10 people lived there paying roughly the same amount as me (some came in later at $300).

There was a total of 3 showers (all lined up like a gym locker room), 2 toilets on the second floor and one on the first. One full kitchen, living room, and dining in the first floor. One of the rooms was on the first. The basement was gross honestly and I never went in there. Decent amount of graffiti, but that level of grossness stayed in the basement.

The kicker was that everybody was individually paying, as I did not know any of them and honesty never got to know them. They are selling the property for $245,000. Doing the math, they were bumping everyoneâ€™s rent to $325 when I was leaving in 2018. I canâ€™t imagine it still being that low, but if it stayed at 325â€¦ thatâ€™s roughly $3,250 income monthly. 

I am 30years old now (I was an older bloke there, but not the oldest). Have a mortgage on my house with $135,000 to pay off. Have a $60,000 a year job. Have $40,000 in Roth IRA, $5,000 in Roth 401k, and $40,000 in personal SP500. Current monthly expenses are roughly $1800-$2200 without investments. 

Thoughts on me purchasing this? Iâ€™m weary why they would be selling a place that seems like promised income. Especially today where most rent in near $900 for a single bedroom. Thoughts? Dialogue?",,,,,
zpzxt7,Money_Tough,"My Property Taxes Have Gone Up Over 34% This Yearâ€¦

How is this sustainable? There havenâ€™t been improvements to my house in years. The county had a 28% increase, the city 28% increase, school district was a 42% increase, and college was 25%â€¦ is this normal across the US?

Update: My city did a county/city wide reassessment at the end of last year. They did this by calculating values instead of walkthroughs. With that school district funding went up about $300,000â€¦ college went up $20,000â€¦ and county expenses by $12,000.",,,,,
zv5ic3,Money_Tough,"How Should I and How Do You Feel About Current Wage Hikes?

I graduated from college and make about average income from the United States. My company is giving me a 4% increase which I was happy with it. That would equate to around $1.20 increase in payâ€¦

My mild questioning comes to the fact that my local Burger King is asking for people at $20 an hour. My brother who works at retail pet company is getting a $7 an hour increase. That would make him be around $22 an hour without any overtime. This is an entry level job requiring no degree.

Iâ€™m happy for him, but a bit frustrated that I have a bachelors in Info Tech and making roughly $28 an hour with no chance of overtime (salary). Am I wrong to feel this way or should I just be happy for everyone else? Does anyone have similar stories or are on the opposite of the spectrum (my brother)?",,,,,
zv5sku,Money_Tough,"My App Personal Capital and Stifels Reached Out To Meâ€¦

They want to start investing my money. Iâ€™m hesitant because Iâ€™ve been investing solely into the SP500 with a .02% charge rate (VOO). Iâ€™m 30 with roughly $90,000 in stocks (including IRA, stocks, and 401k).

Personal Capital wants to manage my funds with a 0.85% expense ratio. They say Iâ€™m too risked and they actively manage which should give higher returns. My biggest issue is that they pushed odd years for comparison (I believe 1999 - 2007 and 2008-2012).

Stifels is my girlfriends holder, but again I donâ€™t know if I need them if I just invest into the stock market with SP500 VOO. Thoughts or assistance when making these decisions?",,,,,
fc5evh,monitorcable,"Help to navigate different options to invest 50k

I know this is a common question, so please help me reddit experts. 

Through the sale of a house and a small inheritance, and years of savings, I have a combined total of 50k that I'm not sure what to do with. I don't have major debt (just $1k in credit cards at 1.99 interest, and 8k left in my car for another 3 years at 3% interest). My job brings me 48k/year. My significant other and I split the bills. He is already retired. We don't struggle, but I have caught myself being more generous with my spending now that I have such a big cushion in the bank. I want to put it all ""in the bank"" to keep it safe and also accumulate/gain some interest instead of just sitting on the savings account that gets I think 1.5%. 

I keep getting advice about government bonds being better than ira's and stocks, but I know those are general terms because there are different kinds of IRA's and stocks. 

I'm 65, not planning on retiring for another 5 years. No life insurance. 

But I'm not up to date with all the different options for a 50k investment, I've never had this type of cash in hand before. I know that fiduciary is the way to go when looking for a financial advisor, but I'd like Reddit's help so I don't go in blind to talk to a fiduciary advisor.",,,,,

fnm7df,monitorcable,"I will inherit a VW van

My dad has a 1960 VW van that is just sitting collecting dust. In Paraguay. I live in the United States. With all this coronavirus talk, he brought it up that, due to his age, we should have the talk about ""inheritance"". He doesn't really have many things of value he didn't even think about this van. I don't think he is aware of how older cars have appreciated and how the VW van has a fanbase. Anyway; if I was to inherit this van, probably in a ""needs some work"" state, is it possible to bring it to the USA? Are there shipping services for this type of situation? I feel clueless about the topic and wonder if anyone has any insights. Thanks! Btw, how can I figure out the value of it?

Edit: it's a 1960 type 1 vw blue van",,,,,
