116nu8p,ExplanationDazzling1,"Paid my Mitsubishi off within 2 months I couldnâ€™t take the high interest rate the stealerships gave me

It feels great not to be in debt anymore! I paid off my loan fast to avoid being upside down! And hopefully I get a refund from the GPS / anti theft tracker as well as the camera they put as mandatory on my contract. My car insurance still high. They got me at $160 per month but Iâ€™m gonna trade it in soon. 

Officially a car owner yâ€™all! Canâ€™t wait to say officially a home owner ðŸ˜Œ Ride this beauty for a few months and trade it in for something even better but a lesser car insurance payment. 

My question is do dealerships take cashier checks? Iâ€™m never financing anything ever in life again unless itâ€™s 0% APR with no interest. Now that I have learned about banks, principal and equity I want to make certain I make the right move when itâ€™s time to trade in my car. Sure itâ€™s gonna be worth less but thatâ€™s what one should expect when driving anything off a lot. 

I want to trade it in for a Toyota XLE or Toyota SE with a sunroof. It can be a Honda Accord too with a sunroof. 

But yeah Iâ€™m proud of myself. It might not be the car I really wanted but itâ€™s my first paid off car in full baby!! Started at 12k mile now we almost at 16k miles",No,Yes,Yes,Yes,No

11igqa1,ExplanationDazzling1,"Trade in - Kelly Blue Book and Carvana are offering me 18k for my Mitsubishi

Please tell me if this is a smart financial decision. My Mitsubishi Sport Outlander SE 2020 is fully paid off. The mileage is remarkable for the year itâ€™s got less than 17,000 miles on it. I bought it Dec 10 with 12,240 miles on it. I paid the car off in full Feb 23. It also shows on my title. 

I had it for only 3 months and I paid it off. I paid $21,400 for it altogether. I liked it at first until I realized I would rather a more fuel efficient car and reliable car. I no longer want a cool looking sports car that drops value like a rock. What really grabbed my attention was the headlights and fog lights. I bought this crossover solely from emotion and pretty looks. I wasnâ€™t thinking about gas mileage at the time. I later found out my mistubishi has a CVT transmission and every time I accelerate on the gas it sounds like a hungry, hungry hippo and then it goes away. The CarPlay is cool but my speaker could be better. The heated seats donâ€™t stay hot for long.. and my heat could be better too. 

Fast forward I have the title for my crossover I just have to get the lien holder released from the title. So Iâ€™ll be going to the dmv soon. Afterwards I could trade my car in for something I like better and more fuel efficient. The current specs on my car:

Vin begins with J so I automatically thought it was reliable. J = Japan 

27 fuel economy 
24 city and 30 highway 

Car insurance: $171.00 ( Iâ€™m not sure why my insurance is so high for this vehicle) I didnâ€™t know it was gonna be this high at the dealership 

I pay $40-50 each week for gas money so thatâ€™s $120 per month. My last billing statement from Samâ€™s Club was in Feb at $130 and Feb at $140

I want a more fuel efficient car with cheaper car insurance

On my mind I am looking at the 2016-2020 Toyota Yaris as an even trade with no down payment. The specs are phenomenal. 

Vin begins with 3. 3 = Mexico so this is reliable too

32/40 MPG City/Hwy

Transmission: Automatic ( Itâ€™s difficult to find cars with no CVT at a reasonable price these days)

Very clean title like my mistubishi. I do see it went to the auction but so did mine. 

Car insurance: If Mitsubishi Replaced my insurance states the following: 

Your 6-Month Policy Premium Will Decrease By
$117.20

So not only Iâ€™ll save on gas but my insurance will be much cheaper!",No,Yes,No,No,No

1276nya,ExplanationDazzling1,"Savings Account APY is 0.45% but what is the APR?

Honestly feel like this credit union ripped off my mom. I never asked her about her savings until a few months ago just to make certain she is earning great money on her money. 


Story time:

My mother came across a $80,000 settlement and she put it at a credit union. They only have a 0.45% APY. After finding out her APY I was angry because she doesnâ€™t know much about APY and HYSA! Now did my research and found out she can move it. Sheâ€™s looking to move it to a CD at the same credit union. 

Now the APY is 4.15% and the APR is 4.05% 

How does APR work?? I wannna put her money in a savings account that she can gain more money. 

We just found out her retirement was in a IRA with a 0.45% interest rate too! She placed $1,000 back in the year of 2000 maybe 2001 in her IRA. So each month she gets $1.64.. in 1 year thatâ€™s  $19.68. She had her IRA for 21 years. 

In 21 years she only got $3,000. Someone please with financial knowledge let me know 

What is APR savings? I know APY is annual percentage yield and the higher the better the interest rate! But what is APR and why is it placed on a CD? 

Right now I have my $3,000 in a HYSA 
I have a 3.60% APY. Started it in December 2023 and I earned $16.00 already and now itâ€™s March. 

So my question is.. Should my mom move her money to a CD for 18 months?

Car Accident October 2022 - Totaled my 2006 car 
October-November Bank Account 22k 
December 2022 - Purchased 2020 car worth 17k car which totaled to 21k
First car buyer Financed the 2020 car with a 9.45% interest rate
April 2023 - 25k with 3k savings account and put 6% on my 401k. 401k $1,000.00 
Realized I bought too much car and paid off the 21k in March
Bank Account $4,000, savings account $3,000 and 401k $1,000.00

Fast forward August 2023:

Bank Account $19,955.00, savings account $3,0093 and 401k $6,000 with a car worth 17k now. Carmax offered me 17k for it

Saved my money religiously, lived under my means and just went to work every single day. 
If I didnâ€™t get in that car accident Iâ€™ll be worth double then what Iâ€™m worth now. During the time I bought my car I couldnâ€™t find absolutely anything and cars were being sold with very high mileage at an expensive price. So I took a leap of faith with a 2020 suv with 12k miles. Iâ€™m not at 23k miles. 

If I did not get in that car accident I never wouldâ€™ve got a 401k or savings account. If I was to sell the car today and buy a used cheap one I would have almost 40k

My goal is to travel out of state once I reach my goal 20k. I do regret buying the car and wish I just rented it out until I found a car at a comfortable budget. But I look at this as a learning experience. My car went from 21k to 17k. Carmax offered me 17k. I look at this as just renting a car. Cars depreciate so much over time. The car is okay I mean it gets me from point A to point B. But just because itâ€™s a 2020 doesnâ€™t make it better than my 2006 Honda. I donâ€™t plan on keeping this car until the wheels fall off. When I get in a better financial situation Iâ€™m trading it over for a car that fits me more! 

Carmax - If I just sale the car they offered me 17k
Carmax - If I trade in my car they offered me 19k 

Down the line Iâ€™m looking to trade my car in for a nicer and faster car. 

FICO credit Score went from 771 to 790 now that I have purchase history

I got really impatient and annoyed and bought a 2020 Mitsubishi Outlander for 21k. Next thing I know I had 3k in my bank account. No savings or 401k. 

Fast forward this year I have 3k in my savings account, 19k in my bank account and 5k in my 401k. I get paid $4,000.00 each month. My car is paid off and I have positive equity in it.

I donâ€™t see any cars in the market that suits me not even the 2023 cars.

The cost of the SUV was 19k but with taxes and paying $2300 for my warranty as well as $999 for a 4K camera the price went up to 24k. They told me the camera was mandatory to have. Thinking back they went through the documents very quickly. They were on the computer scrolling through the documents and just telling me this is just blah blah blah and GAP insurance. Can you believe my GAP insurance cost $945? 

First off I read the papers to the best of my ability and signed each document. Rule number one before going to a dealership get pre approved for credit. I have a pretty good credit score. 756 credit score and a 777 FICO score.

he has around 300K in his 401k and basically plans on making it mine and my brothers inheritance

now this is a little bit tricky but ideally  shouldhe  take out in retirement when his earned income is lower but is it worth for him to take out let's say my 150k, at 25k, increments or even before he retires where his earned income is higher, and just put that into my back door Roth via MY EMPLOYER (verizon) if it's for me?

it will compound tax free after the initial tax hit vs an inherited ira whose money will eventually end up in a brokerage

Vanguard BND is Vanguard's US Bond Fund. Vanguard owns a ton of bonds on behalf of their investors. Every month the fund pays its investors a dividend, but I'm curious about how they decide the size of the dividend.

On the bonds they hold, they are receiving coupon payments and occasionally the principal is returned to them. They have to make a decision about how much (if any) of the coupon payments should be reinvested. They also have to decide if they want to pay any of the principal back to investors. 

I assume they reinvest all of the principal and maybe reinvest some of the interest to grow the total amount of holdings/maintain the allocation goals of the fund.

So like the title says.

5.875 30 year fixed in 2005 when we bought the home.  
We refinanced to a 30 year, 4.1 in 2012, saving us something like 300 a month.

Background: 43 year old couple, two children ages 2 and 4. 

So we have a town-home we've had for 15 years. The larger unit town-home next door is gonna be for sale and we have a chance to buy it for a decent price without a realtor.   (Think Market Value minus the 30 grand or so the guy would lose to the realtor, plus some allowances for carpet, paint etc.) 

We live in an expensive city in a warm southern state, in an expensive neighborhood where the home prices are always ridiculous.  Single family homes in the area we want to be in are out of our reach right now, but might not be in 5 years if we save aggressively.  The next door town home has several things we DO want--a two car garage vs one, a larger yard, more closet space etc--but it is still a town home and I think I will eventually want a single family home.  

I am only considering this unit if we get a real deal on it, and even then, I am thinking maybe 5 years at max there until we save up more for a single family home we really DO want.  In many ways, moving next door will feel like having the same place...just larger.

kpnk64,Feed_Me_No_Lies,"Confusion on how to calculate a ""Break even point"" with a refi that will actually ""cost"" 120 dollars more a month. (Refinancing 23 yr. left on 4.1 30 yr to a 15 yr. 2.1)

Ok. So some background info:    

Bought townhome in 2005 right before the crash.  30 year fixed, 5.875 interest. (Normal at the time.)   
Refinanced under the harp program in 2012--when the place was worth mothing-- to a 30 year 4.1.  Monthly payment went down of course.    

We *were* going to make extra payments to keep on schedule with the original 30 year loan timeframe. Didn't happen. So we have technically 23 years left on the refinanced 30 year at 4.1  

I can now get a refi to a 15 year for 2.1 because interest rates are so low, with roughly $3,800 closing costs.  This would put us right back on schedule (we've been in the house 15 years), but it *would* have a slightly higher payment of about 120 dollars per month because of the shorter timeframe.  Obviously, even thought monthly cost is higher, a *great deal* more would be going toward principal a month because of the 15 year timeframe.    

However, we don't want to be here for 15 years.  Maybe 5 max? We have kiddos now and townhome is feeling small. We are trying to save tons of cash for a new house. (50 k per year for 4-5 years...we live in an expensive area.) However, we *may* keep this house as a rental as we can get good cash for it per month, and it would make a great long term investment/potential in-law home in the future.   

*But what we are trying to figure out is the break even point and if a refi is worth it since we don't plan on being here more than 5 years as our primary residence.*    

**So, with a new mortgage that would be more a month but paying down debt faster, how do I calculate break even?**   

I entered all the info in a refinance calculator and it says ""-31 months"" to break even.""  Obviously, they are expressing months negatively since the mortgage is higher per month, but can I also use this number to calculate break even? I am assuming that timeframe (not quite 3 years) is the amount if time to make up the 3,800 dollars in closing costs with saved interest?   

Current: 190,000 left on loan  
23 years left  
Principal Amount per month:458  
Interest 652  
Escrow 412  

Refi  
Principal Amount per month: 898 (A big difference of course!)   
Interest 332 (A big difference of course!)  
Escrow 412??  (Would this rise since the home is being ""resold?""  Do my property taxes change here? State of FL.)  

Anyway, obviously a refi is the better *long-term option* as it would save something like 84k over the life over the 23 years left on the original, but with a 5 year time span here, we are just trying to see whether it is worth it to refi. Also, I assume if I keep it as a rental, it is worth the re-fi to have someone else pay down our debt faster. I don't think the 120 a month negatively impacts us that much in a rental situation. 

Anyway, thoughts are greatly appreciated here! If I can confidently say ""not quite 3 years is the break even"", then I feel better. If it is shorter, then great but if it is longer, I need to understand how to calculate that as well.",Yes,Yes,No,No,No

Like the title says: The 30 year would lower our current mortgage about 500 bucks.  The refi to a 15 would raise it about 150, but it would shave 8 years off the mortgage as it was reset to a 30 in 2012 under the HARP refi program after the recession.

We are saving cash the next few years to buy a bigger place. (Break even on the refi and have a couple years of the savings each month thrown together with a large part we've been waving for awhile.)  

Would y'all do a 30 year to lower the payment and do something else with the cash, or would you go toward the 15 to pay off the debit faster? If we were going to be in the house for 15 more years the 15 year note is the clear winner.

So I understand the general principal of ""If you can make more money investing somewhere else than your mortgage and are comfortable with it, do that"", but I wanted your opinions.  (43 years old, 2 kids, no other debt, plenty of retirement savings.) 

189,000 left on a townhome currently worth about 370,000.  

**Currently a 30 year refi at 3.0 would drop our monthly payment 279 a month.  
A 15 year at 2.5 would raise it 185 a month.**

Difference between the two mortgage types is 465 a month. (Rounded to 500 for investing down below.) 

Our plan is so save for 2-5 years more, and have a fat down payment on a house we really want. We have 100k in a high interest savings account as a start.  (We are in a townhome and want a house for our kids, but we need to save more to be able to have an affordable mortgage in our area. Hence the savings.  We think we can save 50 grand a year from our businesses, hence the 2-4 year savings goal we've set to be able to get a house we really want in a few years.)  

MAIN SCENARIOS: 
I've looked at amortization tables, and after two years, we would have 14 more grand paid off on principal with the 15 year.

*However,* even if we just saved the 500 a month from the 30 year refi into a regular savings account, we would have 12 grand at the end of that same two years in our pockets/savings acount/investment/529 etc, a roughly 2,000 difference that the 30 year ""Costs us"" over the same time as the 15. 

I would most likely invest in the market in a target fund or total stock market fund or another vehicle as the amount over the few years we will be in the house won't really amount to much of a dent in the savings goals for the new house over the next few years, so that 12 grand we save on the 30 would be something like 13 grand assuming a 5 percent return.  I understand that's not guaranteed.  

Most of our house savings would come from our businesses and I understand that in general, you don't put money in the market you will need in the next 5 years. This extra fund would just be additional long term investing more than likely. I know statistically stock market is an average about 7 percent year to year with wild fluctuations in any year.

Break even on these refis is about 14 months BTW. 

I think the 30 year gives us both more option for financial growth and more flexibility if we decided to rent this house later or whatever.

Hey there. Some background:

Middle aged male taking care of two young kiddos so right now my income is very limited for the first time in my life.  Husband and I have been together 20 years and we're legally married. 

I haven't bought a new car in 20 years as I kept one for 16 years and this old model current one for almost 5.  Well, my car (the current family car) is having troubles and really does need to be replaced. (It's a 2006 BTW.)

ptswhf,Feed_Me_No_Lies,"I need to Buy a car and I'm wondering in this low-interest environment if I should take a car loan instead of paying cash and then put the cash into the market long-term. Advice?

Hey there. So we have 25k cash sitting doing NOTHING in a savings account.  This is earmarked for a new car. I will probabally buy a used car costing around that or a new suv-type vehicle that is 35k or so and keep it for many years. I'm currently driving a 2006 suv that is breaking down and I need an SUV type vehicle for my family car.

I am starting to think it would be a better long-term play to take the 25k (or most of it) and put it in the market long-term in vanguard index total stock market where it will make (on average but not guaranteed) more than the loan percentage on a new or used car is. 

I did this with my mortgage: We refinanced back to a 30 instead of a 15  and took the extra amount we would be paying a month on the 15 (about 500 a month) and I dump it into the market for long-term growth.  I do this monthly and automatically as if our mortgage really is a 15 year and we ""have"" to pay that extra.  Meanwhile, I get the growth of 500 dollars that is (on average but not guaranteed), much better than my 3.00 percent mortgage. 

Is there any good reason not to do this with a car? Seems like I am missing out on a lot of interest compounding if I take that cash and dump it right into a depreciating asset, but I wanted to get your opinions. 

Some additional details:
1. Income in our family is fine, and if we needed more cash, we have plenty we can extract from one of our two business, or plenty of non-retirement stock we could get at if we needed.  

2.  That cash for the car has been sitting there for years doing nothing and I don't feel good about that. I love compounding.  (It was an Old account from spouse, they felt more comfortable with it sitting there years ago etc.) That's my primary motivation for asking the question.  

3.  We have 100k cash sitting in an account doing nothing for a down payment on a home in a few years. I hate that this money is ""doing nothing"" while we decide on where we can live in the next few years, so that's more motivation for me to ""make this car money work for me."" I know you aren't' supposed to throw money in the market you are gonna need in the next  years.  

Anyway, bah blah blah. I understand if we had no other cash or needed this 25k for an emergency fund I wouldn't put i tin the market. But, since this is ""Car money"" anyway, I am trying to see the best route here. 

Any advice would be appreciated! :)",Yes,Yes,No,Yes,Yes
q5xxz8,Feed_Me_No_Lies,"Spouse opened a credit card at Pottery Barn Kids, they gave a twenty thousand limit. That's Too much credit when we need to be looking at mortgages. Need Advice on next steps....

Hey there. Yes: They gave him a $20,000 dollar limit on a freaking pottery barn kid's card. Sigh. I don't want us to have a high credit Limit  to Income ratio because I know the banks look at that when shopping for mortgages. (We will be shopping in a few months to a year.) 

We absolutely don't need the card, he just opened it up to get the at purchase time discount.  

So my questions: 

1.  Should we cancel the card? I heard this is detrimental in credit reporting etc. 
2. Is there a way to have pottery barn potentially LOWER the the limit to something reasonable like 500?  If so, is that the route we should take?

Hey there. 

The Car:  
Looking at a Brand new (we will keep it for 15 years), 7-seat Family Crossover SUV for 45 k to replace an SUV that is 15 years old. 

I have  25k cash earmarked for a car, and was considering financing a small loan for the 20k balance  though we could buy it outright no problem. The question is this: Because We will be looking for a new home in the next year or so, would it be more attractive to our potential mortgage lender for us to have a small loan and therefore more cash to put down on the house, or is more attractive to them for us to have less cash to put down, but no small car loan?  (The houses will be in the 700k range we are looking at and we will be putting 20-25 percent down.) 

We have no other debt other than our current mortgage. I know about DTI ratios and whatnot, but I don't know if we should take the loan if we didn't need to. and how this is viewed by lenders.

Thanks in advance...I hope it made sense! :)",Yes,Yes,No,Yes,No
qaeecb,Feed_Me_No_Lies,"With home prices having skyrocketed and interest rates having dropped, is the old saying that you should ""buy a home no more than 3x's your yearly income"" even valid anymore?

So I live in a high cost of living area, and with interest rates being what they are and the market being what it is, it would be almost impossible to find anything for my growing family in the area we want to be that comes even close to only three times our annual incomes if we want to stay in our current radius.

We are looking at two houses to get out of our townhome we've been in for 15 years. We have about two years of income in equity in it that we will use for a new house.

Here's the thing: Even The ""cheaper"" house options we are looking at are still 4.7 times our yearly incomes in our city. You can get cheaper, but they are in areas we have no desire to live in either do to school districts, commute time etc.

The one that is more expensive--but we would put more cash down on to ensure a DTI under 36--is 7.3 times our annual income.

We have no other loan obligations except our current mortgage, so we are in good shape there, and we have several years of income saved up in cash for down payment of 25-30 percent on either home, but the total home prices in my area are simply MUCH more expensive than 3 times our yearly income.

So is this old rule even valid anymore? Or is the answer ""move to a cheaper neighborhood farther out"" the correct one here? Again, we would pay enough cash on any home we got into so that we wouldn't be over-mortgaged, but I am really wondering about this rule and if it still applies.",Yes,Yes,No,Yes,No
qaquaq,Feed_Me_No_Lies,"Have any of you rented a property that was only profitable in a small way year to year but did it long term to have someone else pay down the note? Is it worth it?

So.  Aside form the question of ""Do you want to be a landlord?"", I am wrestling with on whether or not to keeping our townhome as a rental property long-term since it will only generate 5-8 k of profit a year on 26-28k of rent depending on various factors of maintenance and whether or not it takes one month or more to turnaround etc.

Stats:
Townhome Built in 2005, we are the original owners. It is our primary residence, but we are looking at a new home for our growling family.  
Our unit is one of the smallest available homes/units in a VERY high cost of living/sought planned neighborhood, so it rents nicely and quickly from what I have seen.  
We have Had it for 15 years so we rode out the financial crisis dip for a decade and a huge amount of equity just recovered post-pandemic.  
Would sell today for about 440,000 with about 190,000 being left on the mortgage.  (Recently re-fied back to a 30 year to drop the payments in case we decided to rent it out, and it would only take a year to recoup the costs of the refi.)    

So, we have Equity of 220k-240k  if we sold depending on with a realtor or not yada yada yada. 
It would rent for about 2,400 giving us about 26,400 of rental income a year with a one month turnaround. (Less if longer turnaround obviously.) 

I think long term, it's a great investment but with what is left on on the note, high association fees, lawn maintenance and everything else, even renting at the market rate of about 2,400 a month, we only have that 5-8k profit at the end of each year. 

Now, we would either put down that profit on the note, or put in a higher earning investment since the note is at 3.0 percent. 

But...is worth it? I know it would be a low maintainence property very near where my new home would be.",Yes,Yes,No,No,No
srhy1r,Feed_Me_No_Lies,"New house question: 20 percent down 30 year fixed and invest the equity from current home long-term, or take the equity and roll it into the new house to lower mortgage principal?

Hey there. So here are some stats:

Current townhome (been there 17 years) is too small. We now have two young kids and need a bigger garage, an extra bedroom, more appropriate yard etc.  We refinanced our townhome about a year ago with the plans to save for 2-3 years for a house. Instead of a 15 year, we refinanced to a 30 and are taking the 500 a month that would have gone to principal with a 15 and we are investing in long-term index funds to grow more than it would on a 3.1 percent loan.  

However, an opportunity came up on a new house and we would need to make an offer by close of business...TODAY. lol. (Couple in new house is only showing this weekend and taking an offer that comes up this weekend.  They will receive multiple offers, potentially over asking. Real estate in my state is RED HOT with post-covid transplants from California and New York jacking up sale prices.) 

**NUMBERS:**
We are 45 years old, two young kids ages 3 and 5. So we will be 60 when youngest is graduating high-school/going off to college.  
Current townhome could probabally sell for $500,000. (Maybe more. Maybe QUITE a bit more as the location is PREMIUM and NO current inventory. Maybe even $600,000 but I will use the low number for estimation purposes.)   
We owe $190,000 @30 year, 3.1 (Refinanced about a year ago.)  
Potential equity in our pockets after 6 percent realtor fees assuming the above sales price: $275,000 (roughly)
**EDIT: Income is variable. Husband makes about 200-250k profit in business a year, I make 10-40k in mine.**.  

**New house:**
Asking $500,000  
We will probabally offer 510,000 to stave off other local offers but we won't play if someone from California offers 75k over asking or whatever. 

Now, We plan on being in this home to get our kids through high school (They are currently Ages 3 and 5). I don't think this is a ""forever home"", but we pan on being there for 10-15 years for sure.)

We have the current cash to put the 20 percent down without using the equity in our current townhome, but we could use the equity in our current home to lower the principal to something like $85,000. (275,000 equity from current home plus 110,000 cash savings we have for down payment.)   

So the question is: Do we want to lower the principal to something like 85,000 with that extra equity money, or should we just do the 20 percent down and finance $408,000?

*Assuming I could afford the higher mortgage monthly amount either way and that we would be approved for a higher mortgage*, what would you guys do? $275,000 equity is a lot of cash. Current loans are like 3.8 percent for 30 year (they have jumped up quite a bit.)  I am comfortable with risk and long-term investing. If we DIDN'T  use the equity to lower the new mortgage, we would definitely grow it: Vanguard index funds in a our brokerage account to sit for years and grow.   

Soo....what do ya think? Lower that new house principal by putting a lot more than 20 percent down, or grow our current house equity in vanguard index funds long-term to be used for things like college, braces, or whatever?  

So other things to consider: We both own our own businesses, but it is true that good fortune can change and the great financial years we have been experiencing may change.  That makes the idea of a lower monthly payment attractive, but if we had that cash still growing in the market/savings, we could dump that in a re-fi if we needed to if our business fortunes change.  

What do ya think given our age, our kids' ages and the home prices/our savings etc?  (Maybe we put more than 20, but less than the full equity amount as another option?) Thanks in advance!!!! :)",Yes,Yes,No,Yes,No

So. We have a townhome as our primary with about 250-275k equity in it.  (Owe 190, market value of about 500 or more depending on several factors.)  

We are purchasing a new home ($530,000 3.49 fixed 20 percent down).  

We got approval for the new lender for both mortgages, so we did not have to put a contingency down that we needed to sell our current home.  So we will live here while new home is being renovated. (Double mortgage for 6 months sucks, but pales in comparison to having to move twice or live in a construction one in the new house.) 

We were/are considering renting out our current townhome, but that is looking less and less attractive due to the need/desire for access to equity, and the fact that it is an expensive, class a property and the profit margin wouldn't be that great. If we kept it for renting, it would be for LONG term.  

We have the cash to close on new house no problem.  HOWEVER, the house needs some major renovations: 100-200k worth. (It's a beautiful mid-century modern that has had half a restore. We will need to do full with electrical upgrades etc. That spirals into new kitchen cabinets, drywall etc.  We probabally have all that covered--without selling the current home--except for about 75 grand or so.   

My Current lender--my conservative credit union-- says they will not do a heloc on the current property because it will be an investment property at time of closing on the new house. I have not talked to other lenders yet to see if they will. 

I have heard after I close on the new house, I can do a heloc on IT since I will have put 20 percent down. 

But aren't HELOCS subject to Debit to income ratios in the same way as first mortgages? If so, we are already mortgaged to the hilt with the current and the new after closing. So, I don't even know if a heloc is an option. (We are two business owbers, so getting full approval on the new mortgage was kind of hell since I had to submit so much documentation and the industry is really setup for regular w2 employees.) 

Are there other ways besides a heloc or selling?  Construction loans etc?

I know we could sell this place, rent it back for a few months from new owners--probabally not as many as 6--and have all the quity we needed, but baring that, what options do y'all see here for me?

Upstairs has 3 bedrooms, one is the nursery for the babies, the other is the master bedroom, and the third is the guest room/home office and I typically sleep in there. We have a fully functional gym in the garage but I anticipate Iâ€™ll have to move things around and make that an office when the new baby comes.

Im 24 and live in the US, and with everything happening recently, should I sacrifice my career path for job/financial security? 

I'm working a job that I've wanted to leave for awhile, and I know I'll likely be laid off in the next few weeks. Im middle-manager who's trying to find a new white collar job for office experience, and have been applying to banks, hospitals, and corporate positions. I'm limited by my lack of college degree, I plan on going to college later, but right now I'm trying to find entry-level positions at these places to get my foot in the door.

I haven't received any offers yet, and my family is pushing for me to get a job at a grocery store, gas station, or other similar jobs with openings right now. In my area, the governor is likely to close down all non-essential businesses for awhile, and I'm sure many who become affected with layoffs/closings will flood to those job openings once it happens. 

I have a few months savings, and I was told by a mentor to never sacrifice your career path for job security if you can help it.

I live and work in the US and as I'll be laid off any day now, I'm wondering what you think the best next financial steps are? . 

-I have a small emergency fund that will cover about 6-8 months of my living expenses. I was planning on using it to go to college one day, but it seems like that'll be on hold for awhile.

-I have about $7,000 from the car insurance money

-Ill likely be eligible for unemployment if I get laid off

-I dont have a car, or family to help, and I live on my own

1. I'm looking for an office job to further my career, but it might take awhile. I've been told to go on unemployment for a bit, and instead of finding a bad job immediately, and spend more time finding a good job. It will be hard to watch my savings go if I'm out of work for too long, and I know employers don't like to see resume gaps. What do you think is the smartest move financially?

2. I can walk to grocery stores, but the lack of a car limits my job hunt. While others have told me that I could find a decent used car in the $4000-7000 range, would it be more shrewd to buy bus pass for now and save the money?

I've was let go from my job a few days ago, and I was wondering if you have some financial advice for what I should be doing, if some larger expenses I've been considering make sense, and if you have any advice in general for handling a layoff? 

**Assets**: 

Savings: $17,500 (7 months of my living expenses)

Unemployment: I just filed for unemployment so I dont know for sure, but it estimates out around $187-263 a week after taxes. I'm not sure how to apply for the additional $600 a week as part of the CARES Act ($450 after taxes), or if I'll be eligible for it. 

**Living Expenses**: $2,500 a month. I not to have many non-essential expenses. I'm evaluating my bank statements, but right now there's not too much I can cut out except maybe changing my health insurance.

I wanted to get your thoughts on these additional expenses that I'm debating on that would come out of the $17,500:

-A used car ($6000-8000 or 3-4 months of living expenses): My car was totaled a week before everything shutdown in my state. It's limiting to my job search without one, but I realize how important having money now is. I have friends who could drive me to interviews, but I'd need to see what public transportation is still open for more reliable transportation. 

-Bicycle repairs ($300-400 or around a quarter of a month of living expenses): I have an old bike from a few years ago which probably needs a lot of work. Fixing it would be able to get me further/quicker to places.

-A laptop (estimated cost: $1800 or 1 month of living expenses): I have a computer, but it's old and freezes up/dies quite often which makes applying for jobs or doing anything with it frustrating. I wanted this for use as a day planner, to apply for jobs faster, and take courses online for certificates. 

-College education: I've wanted to go to college for a long time, but my meetings with school financial advisers had to be postponed. I have no idea what financial aid I'd get, but it seems that it would be $15,000-$20,000 a year paying out of pocket if I went full time, and I'd be going part time. I'd mostly be concerned about needing money for living expenses, so I dont know how I'd be able to go to school without also working full time. 

-Health insurance: It's expensive relative to my financial information, but I had few options. I qualify now to change my health insurance policy, so I can get one that's cheaper (maybe down to $90-$110 a month, but it wont cover much, and itd be more for if I didnt want to pay more than 20k in an emergency).

1. What is your advice/thoughts for my finances?

2. Do you have any advice about how to best handle this situation financially/productively while staying sane and healthy? 

3. I worked as an office manager for the last year and a half, and have almost two years of retail experience on top of that. I don't have a degree, and I'm fairly early into my career. I'm looking for office/administrative work in a hospital/bank/office setting. I understand the lack of degree may hurt, and with the ongoing situation, I may have to take a different job down the line.

gzofvv,FinancialFlora,"How can you improve your financial health and credit score in this situation?

Hi, I'm in my mid-twenties and I'm looking to improve my financial health and credit score as much as possible?

I currently net about $2,000 a month after taxes, and have a 10 month emergency fund in my savings account at a credit union (which is needed for me with the ongoing financial climate). 

I have two credit cards, one from a couple years ago, and the other I got just a few weeks ago. The first one has a small limit and the second one is a bit larger. They don't have rewards, but I'm using them up to 25% of their limit each month for everyday expenses to build my credit, and they're set to automatic full-balance payments. 

I've never had student loans, or any other type of loans. I really want a shining credit score for future loans and apartments, and I'm planning on going to college in about six months. The bank I got my second credit card from said I already had a pretty good credit score from the first credit card line being open for the last few years, even though I never used it, so I was able to qualify for the """"premium"""" card with no annual fees. 

**Questions**

My emergency fund is just sitting in my savings account. Should I move it to a different type of account, like a money-market account? 

How much can I increase my credit score in the next six to eight months through responsibly utilizing my credit cards, and how long will it take to get a great score overall (800+)? 

How long should I wait before opening another credit card to increase my credit score (maybe one with rewards) if I just opened a card a few weeks ago, and plan on having a credit check for a new apartment in six to eight months?

Besides cutting down on monthly expenses, and following the Prime Directive on this subreddit, is there any advice you have for me to improve my financial health and build good credit?",Yes,Yes,No,Yes,No
gzpn3y,FinancialFlora,"Questions about credit utilization and applying for more cards?

Currently I keep my credit cards at 25% of their total line of credit each month and pay in full automatically when the balance is generated. Is 25% a good amount, or should I got higher/lower to increase the credit I get each month? 

Now I know going over 30% utilization will negatively impact my score, but will paying off my utilization multiple times in the month increase it? My bank teller said that the statement is only generated once, so if I were to use 25%, pay it off, then use 25% again within the month it'd make no difference in increasing my score.

Lastly, I currently have a credit card from a bank that I never use, and I'm looking to increase my limits. I recently got a credit card from my regular bank with a much higher limit, and they did a hard pull to check my score. Could the first bank use the same pull to review increasing my limits, or would they have to conduct another pull?",Yes,Yes,No,No,No
i87wqa,FinancialFlora,"Which of these supplementary insurance plans are actually worth the cost in this situation?

I'm in my mid-twenties and started my first job that's offering semi-decent health insurance, but its also offering a lot more. Besides your basic medical, dental, and eye-care, which of these insurance plans make sense financially? 

Background: I've always had weird health conditions and an irregular heart, nothing known to be life threatening though. I'm in okayish shape, but I'm mostly on my own financially, I live month to month and any kind of accident that'd put me out of work would eliminate my income entirely. I work an office job that I could likely work mostly if not completely remote if needed.

**All offered insurance types cost about $10-12 dollars each per month**

*Short-term disability: This one is the one I question most. My work already provides free long-term disability, and this one requires me to be working atleast part-time and gives me the equivalent of about 55% of my weekly gross income each week. I need to have the disability for atleast 8 days before it starts to pay out. 

*Critical illness: Pays out a maximum of $13,000 for one-time diagnoses of large-scale health issues like terminal cancer, strokes, or heart attacks. Only 25% of that amount for things like brain tumors and heart surgery. 

*Accident insurance: I also must still be working atleast part-time for this to pay out, and pays pretty well for things like surgical fracturs and dislocations (around $5,000) burns (around $9,000) and but not much for things like days spent in the ICU ($400 a day).

With everything, I'd probably be going to end up paying around $120 a month or about 6-7% of my net income. Which do you think is worth it?",Yes,Yes,No,No,Yes
iadz16,FinancialFlora,"How do you learn negotiation skills?


I suck at negotiating, and find myself continually taken advantage of, and Im trying to learn how you build good negotiating skills?

I told a friend about trying to work on my skills at negotiating and being treated fairly at work (as I'm often too nice and get taken advantage of from not advocating for myself properly). I was given a few seasons of the show ""Pawn stars"" and books on negotiating and people skills with others, but many of them seem too focused on ""mind hacks"".

A lot of these books heavily rely on these social engineering tactics that the authors stress heavily affects negotiation and communication with other people: mirroring their body language, repeating the last few words of others sentences in the form of a question, talking like a therapist (""it seems like *blank* is important to you and you're *insert feeling* about *insert current circumstances*) and wait for them to elaborate with more information that might help the negotiation, being overly apologetic when you can't do something, etc. 

While in fairness, most of these tactics are in theory just designed to get the other person to reveal more information by getting them to elaborate on their feelings and wants to help the negotiation, I'm having trouble identifying which of these tactics are useful and which are real or would actually make things worse.

How do you learn to negotiate,band have good people skills without being taken advantage of?",Yes,Yes,No,Yes,Yes
j8uxzg,FinancialFlora,"My credit card automatic payments don't take the full amount, will this hurt my score?

I come from a financially illiterate family, and learning any information about credit card balances and payments (and their impact on my credit score) has been like pulling teeth with my bank and anyone else. My credit card is setup for automatic payments, but it only takes out the minimum amount due when it makes the automatic payments. Will this hurt my score because the payments aren't for the full amount?

I am beyond confused. I know its a myth that having a balance carry over into the next month is good for your credit score, but some people at my bank still seem to believe it. I try to keep my credit card balance utilization below 20% each month, but unless I pay it off manually, the automatic payment only takes the minimum amount due instead of the full balance. 

I was told the reason is that its okay to keep an amount on my balance to carry over into the next months billing cycle, in fact it's good for my credit score to show utilization, by make bank. Is this true, or should I fight to have my automatic payments pay the full balance of my card? 

**Bonus question to make a lady's day** Can I use above 20-30% utilization on my credit card without negatively impacting my credit score, as long as I get it down to 20-30% before the end of the month? Or is using more than 30% at any point during the month automatically affecting my credit score?",Yes,Yes,No,Yes,Yes

My living expenses are about $2,300 a month, and I save about $200-400 a month depending on any emergency expenses. An close family member left me an inheritance I haven't touched, and its about a year's worth of living expenses. I have no debts, mid 700's credit, and no loans. 

My landlord is a slumlord, and I dont expect to get my security deposit back or a good reference (this is my first apartment too). Im hoping between having a cosigner and the inheritance, landlords will still accept my applications.

I'm also concerned about killing my career. The last two jobs I had, I worked about two years each at. My current one, Ive been at for about 5 months, and I'd leave it to move if they don't have remote work availability.

Even though I've paid that amount, and its been a few months, my credit balance appears the same on Intuit Turbo and my score hasn't gone back up.

A weird result has also been that my balance has stopped updating on the credit score application I used to monitor it since. Meaning it hasn't made my score go lower each month, but it just thinks I still have that unpaid balance, and my score won't go up anymore.

I've heard credit utilization has no memory, so does that mean my score will go back to how it was before the higher utilization report? Or does that mean I just won't keep going lower?",Yes,Yes,No,Yes,No

My credit balance from Transunion hasn't updated since October.

My score hasn't gone up or down, but doesn't display like the report has been outstanding/late. 

Credit Karma recommends that my utilization should go down to improve my credit score by as high as 10 points if I ""paid"" my balance, as it still thinks I'm carrying the same amount as October.. Should I dispute this with Transunion?

There's a landlord who is known for charging tenants over their security deposit, and cat urine in the carpet. Tried really hard to get it out, but throughout, and pretty sure they might want to replace the carpet.

My Mom lives in the US and was taken advantage of financially for a long time by my father. He never allowed her on any accounts, yet made sure she was on any loans they signed. They divorced a few years ago, and she's still recovering from the financial situation my father left her in.

She is very concerned she might be on loans that she doesn't remember, specifically for the house she gave up in the divorce. My father gave her some form that was notarized basically saying to her that she's off the hook for any loans/debts her name was on, but he's just as likely to have made that in Microsoft Word. 

Is there some way for her to see if she's still on any loans or has any debts associated with her, if she doesn't remember who she would have went through to get them? Were still pretty poor, and couldn't afford a lawyer right now.

At the end of December, I get a lengthy invoice from the dentist's office detailing all the work done, and how the insurance company didn't pay the full amount requested on various odds and ends throughout the year, and now the dentist's office has the gall to say I owe them over $500.

Hi everyone!

I have a student loan composed of two parts, a federal unsubsidized loan and a federal subsidized loan.  Both have a nominal interest rate of 2.875%, but the federal government pays the interest on the subsidized portion, leaving the total loan with an effective interest rate of ~1.5% (the unsubsidized portion is slightly larger.)

But when the full repayment kicks back in later this year, what should I do?  I could afford to pay more, but what's the call on an effective interest rate of 1.5%?  (I won't be allowed to pay only the unsubsidized portion anymore when the forbearance ends.)",Yes,Yes,No,Yes,No

o4a6s7,fizzle63,"When calculating the ""return"" on paying a debt, shouldn't you account for the additional income tax deductions as part of the return?

So it seems the standard equation goes like, you're guaranteed a return of the interest you don't have to pay, so a loan at 2% APR would guarantee a return of 2% if paid early.  So if you could make a guaranteed 3% elsewhere, say in Treasuries, it wouldn't make sense to overpay on your 2% loan since you'd be missing out on a 3% return to chase a 2% return.  Simple enough.

Some loans, however, allow for a federal income tax deduction on interest paid.  Shouldn't that be calculated into the return on overpayment?  Wouldn't that boost the return up to 25% or so, in certain cases?  For instance, if I overpaid my student loan payment by $1,000 while in forbearance and that amount went almost fully to interest, and being under the $2,500 annual limit, that $1,000 would result in not only the amount of interest saved, but also $250 less in income tax I'd have to pay, which, even adjusted for inflation until next year, is nearly a 30% return, isn't it?

p5rdoz,fizzle63,"Do you include small cap value funds such as VSIAX in your asset allocation?

In *All About Asset Allocation*, Richard Ferri claims that a 70/30 split between a domestic broad market index and a small cap value fund can increase returns without increasing risk that much.  Of course this book was written in 2010.

The performance of the CRSP US Small Cap Value Index over the last decade (2011-2020) was nothing to write home about, however; the index underperformed both total market index and the S&amp;P 500 index.  

Ferri did somewhat predict this on page 125 of his book, stating ""This is not to say that the return premiums will be as high 30 years from now or will materialize at all.

I recently read that the first question one should ask regarding the inclusion of an asset class in your portfolio is:  ""Does it return a *real*, after-inflation return?""  If not, the asset class is not appropriate for your core investment portfolio.  (And thus might be better suited for your smaller speculative portfolio along with commodities, artwork, derivatives, etc.)

So with that being said, I have my doubts that most bond funds over the last two years are returning a real return after inflation.  So does that mean that bond funds shouldn't be part of your core asset allocation at all?  But if you don't do bonds, then what?  In your 80/20 allocation, if you remove bonds, then what do you use for the other 20?  Crypto?  Cash?  Just go 100% equities and bear the risk?  I like having my 20% non-equities but hell, if that 20% isn't returning a real return I should ditch it, according to the above rule.

On a side note, do you think there will soon be actual books on asset allocation written in today's environment that would unabashedly advocate for 0% bonds for most investors regardless of age and risk tolerance?

Like investment/rental property to be specific? Even a moderately-priced single family home would take about 50% of my taxable account for down payment, costs, renovation, and reserves, no?

kzdur2,formalde_heidi,"Does the current 0% interest on federal student loans change the Prime Directive in any way?

This question is about how to prioritize paying off debt vs saving for retirement, considering the current circumstances around federal student loans.

My spouse and I (28 and 29) are on track to finish paying off my graduate school debt (~$100k, all federal, 6.0-7.8%) in September. The interest-free forbearance has helped immensely. 

We have an emergency fund of 6+ months' expenses, and have been stashing all of our would-be student loan payments in a HYSA. We are preparing to make a large lump-sum payment at the end of the forbearance. 

Following the prime directive flowchart, all we are doing for retirement at this point is getting the full employer match. We currently have very little saved for retirement. We had planned to start maxing out IRAs after the student debt paid is off. 

However, considering that the loans are at 0% right now, should we:

- max out our 2020 IRAs before April, thereby delaying loan payoff ~3 months?

- stay the course, payoff loans in Sept and then max 2021 IRAs (missing out on 2020 contributions)?

- decide based on how much longer (if at all) the 0% interest period is extended? 

Another factor to consider is that we anticipate hitting the Roth income limit within the next 5-8 years, so we feel some pressure to take advantage of Roth IRAs during the limited time that we will be able to do so.

I appreciate your feedback!",Yes,Yes,No,Yes,No
l5gzzb,formalde_heidi,"Vanguard or Fidelity for beginners opening Roth IRAs?

My spouse and I are looking to open our first Roth IRAs in the next two months and have been reading up on our options. We've read the entire 'investing' page in the sidebar wiki as well as several additional articles comparing Vanguard and Fidelity.

It seems like Vanguard is more well-established and offers more options but has a confusing user interface. Fidelity, on the other hand, seems to offer less options, but tends to score higher across several categories when ranked head-to-head with Vanguard, and also has a very user-friendly online platform. 

We are leaning toward Fidelity because we are still learning, and investments are confusing enough without having additional difficulty with the user interface. We have been debating between going with a target date fund or constructing our own three-fund portfolio, either way we are planning on being relatively passive investors.

l9foxk,formalde_heidi,"New Fidelity Roth IRA - help me decide asset allocation?

My spouse and I are new to investing and recently we each opened Fidelity Roth IRAs and maxed out 2020 contributions. We have been doing a lot of research into creating three-fund portfolios and we are a little undecided on which index funds to buy into. Considering that we are 28/29 years old and hope to retire around age 60, we were considering skipping bonds entirely for now (thoughts?). We were thinking about 60-70% US equities, 30-40% international equities.

Here are a couple of our more targeted questions:

* **US Total Market Index Fund: FZROX** (0% ER, est 2018) **or FSKAX** (0.015% ER, est 1997)? The composition seems similar, but I'm not sure if it's worth going with the longer-established fund, or should I take advantage of the 0% ER with the newer fund? Should we take our 60-70% for US equities and split it between these two funds, or is that unnecessarily complicated?
* Same question but about **International Index Funds: FZILX** (0% ER, est 2018) **or FTIHX** (0.06%, est 2016)? 
* A lot of the advice online is to find a fund that follows the S&amp;P500. I'm not exactly sure how to determine if a fund follows the S&amp;P500. Fidelity does have a **500 Index Fund (FXAIX)** with a low expense ratio (0.015%) and a 10-year average return of 13.49%. Should we buy into this fund in addition to a US Total Market Index Fund, or in lieu of? The composition seems  similar to FZROX/FSKAX, so I'm not sure if it would be redundant.
* Is it worth adding a **mid-cap blend (like FSMAX)** to our portfolio and allocating \~10%?

nikmc7,formalde_heidi,"How to buy and sell mutual fund shares in a Fidelity Roth IRA?

28 years old, goal retirement age is 60. I am new to investing and recently opened a new IRA, I don't have much experience with transactions. I know my questions are probably stupid but I figured it doesn't hurt to ask.

I have $6,000 in my Fidelity Roth IRA (60% FZROX, 40% FZILX) and recently rolled an old Primerica Roth IRA with about $8,000 (100% SCHAX) into my Fidelity account. Because of the fees, I want to sell all of my SCHAX shares and buy more of my current holdings so I end up with 70% FZROX and 30% FZILX of the total balance.

On the Fidelity website, I see there is an option to ""sell and use proceeds to buy another,"" which I tried, but I received an error message: *""The mutual funds you selected to sell and buy have conflicting settlement periods and therefore are not eligible for the trade type you entered. Please enter a separate sell order for the fund you wish to sell and return to the website after your sell order has settled to enter a buy order for the fund you wish to purchase, or contact a Fidelity representative.""*

Simple enough, but I have a couple questions:

1. When I ""sell all shares,"" I assume it will be a 2-3 business day process; will the money then end up in my ""cash available to trade"", and from there I can purchase the FZROX/FZILX shares? Is it that simple?
2. Will I be subject to transaction fees for something like this, and if so, how can I find out what those fees are before completing my transaction? Is there a more cost-effective way of achieving what I want to achieve?
3. As stupid as it sounds, I don't want to somehow accidentally make a withdrawal from my IRA.  I am confused about the difference between ""cash available to trade"", cash (core)"", ""cash credit/debit"", ""settled cash,"" ""cash available to withdraw,"" etc. I want to know which of those 'buckets' my $8,000 will end up in when I sell all my SCHAX shares so I don't accidentally incur some type of penalty.

My spouse and I are hoping to buy a house this year around August, when our apartment lease ends. We both have good credit scores (760 and 775). However, we will be paying off some debt shortly before applying for a mortgage, and we are worried about it causing a significant dip in our scores so close to buying a house.

r9u54s,genzbiz,"Fine tune my investing strategy!

 

I am a 23 year old earning around $80,000 pre-tax, with about $50,000 in investments. Currently, I have no loans but invest roughly $2,000 per month. This includes maxing out my Roth IRA, HSA, 401K (I only max out based on my employerâ€™s match. I understand this isnâ€™t the best investment source), and Crypto. My other earnings go to expenses. Yes, my expenses are high, long story short I have an expensive hobby that I delayed gratification for FOR YEARS, and felt like that trade-off is much worth my well-being. The thing is that I would like to get into real estate investing (REI), not only for retirement/net worth building but for passive income as well. In order to save and scale, I am planning on dropping my investments from $2,000/m to about $1,500. This would cut off my HSA ( I would rather leverage the money I have now for REI rather than utilize slow compound interest). Iâ€™m not sure if I should drop my 401K because there is a 100% match up to 3% ($2,400 employer $2,400 me) and 50% match from 3-5% ($800 employer $1,600 me), totaling $7,200 out of the potential $19,500. I also want to enjoy life now, so earning more income on the side would be appreciated. 

Based on what I mentioned, here are my goals:

$20,000 in passive income by 26.

Hi all,

My wife is a teacher making 75k she is on her second year of maternity leave. Our goal was for her to be a stay at home mom so she took a leave of absence these last 2 years. This would be her last year before she has to make a decision to go back to her job or quit and lose a pension, etc. 

Over these last 2 years she realized she doesnâ€™t love her job as much as she thought and has thought about doing other things that provided more freedom and a better work family balance, part time. 

I make around  210k and max out my employee sponsored 401k and get 7% employee contributions. 

On top of that I max out my Roth IRA and my wifeâ€™s Roth IRA yearly

We are 31 years old with a net worth of 510k (including home equity).  

My question is, with the way I am investing for retirement, should I focus on â€œlosing the pensionâ€. A lot of my wifeâ€™s peers stress the importance of her losing this pension. I am ok with her leaving this job because our happiness and family time has been exponentially better and exactly how we want to live our lives. 

But, the comments about the â€œpensionâ€ like itâ€™s this golden egg. Trade your happiness and soul for a pension?

f2dkc3,goodfight10,"Need advice on budget and savings vs. student loans.

Hey guys,

About a year ago I posted my budget and got a swift kick into reality. Since then we really worked hard on changing our financial habits and issue. We increased our monthly income by 2k and decreased our monthly expenses by 1.5k. 

We are about 4 months in on Dave Ramseyâ€™s get out of debt plan and have reduced our debt by around 56,000. Paying about 17,000 and getting out of a car loan. 

Right now we are both not contributing to 401k or putting towards our 3 months old college fund, as of yet. We are also on such a tight budget itâ€™s starting to get exhausting. 

We are 28 years old. 

Income 2019: 206,000

Assets: ~50k in retirement. 

Home: 80-100k in equity

Emergency fund: 1000 ( as Dave recommends)

Debts:
Truck: 22,000 (Will be paid off this June)

Student loans: 86k (54k 5.6% and 31k at 3-4%)
The 31k loan minimum is 116 and will slowly creep up over the next years. 

Home: 374k (worth around 480ish)

Take home pay: 9,670

Reoccurring monthly expenses: 6,027.31

2800-2900 extra going towards debt each month. 

If we stay on this super strict budget the truck will be paid off by June and then the loans should be completely done by February 2022. Assuming, nothing goes wrong or comes up, which is nearly impossible. 

What I wanted to do was:

Pay off truck by June.

Continue paying minimums for loans for remainder of term (7 years)

Contribute 15% each to retirement and 250 a month towards 529. 

That would be: 24,624 a year for retirement and 3,000 for college 

It would leave us with 701.53 extra a month without any side hustle or OT. 

If we did that for 7 years we would have contributed:

172,368 towards retirement 

21,000 to college. 

I canâ€™t seem to find a happy medium. Dave Ramsey and his community say â€œbeans and riceâ€ be miserable and pay everything off. 2.5 years is a long time for that. 

I really want to be debt free, however, every time something little comes up and takes away from the extra debt payments it really throws me for a loop. 

I read some articles stating leave the low interest loans, etc. 

Our future goal in the next 2-5 years would be to upgrade to a bigger house around 100k more.

I posted yesterday about a refinance offer I had on the table and quite frankly, this seems to be pretty stressful and confusing. 

Current term: 30 years with 28 left. 

Current original loan: 382,000

Current loan amount: 372,000

Original interest rate: 4.375%

Payment: 3052/month (taxes, principal, pmi)


Loan offer #1(from current lender whom I have mortgage with now): 3.5% no points (30 year)

Closing costs: 7000

New finances amount:379,000 (escrow account being paid cash)

New payment will be around 390 less a month. 

Loan offer #2 (Quicken loans): 2.99% (30 years)

Closing costs: 7,252 (including paying for 1 point)

New financed amount: 390,000

New payment saves: 480 a month. 

I feel like the 2.99% is obviously better but comes at a higher cost because the escrow (I think) is rolled into the loan. 

Iâ€™m almost to the point where I will just tell both lenders who are heckling me to do a deal today that I will be walking away and keeping my rate.

Only thing in question is that we have a 5 year plan and not sure if we will be here after 5 years, itâ€™s 50/50 right now.

We owe 7,900 on a 2019 car, worth 24-26k now, which will be paid up this month and will free up 467 dollars extra a month. 

I have 84k In student loans.

54k at 4.9% for 20 years paying 360 a month (just refinance again.)

30k federal loans ranging from 2-6%

Our plan is as follows:

Pay off truck this month, free up the 467 a month. Wait until September (my wifeâ€™s a teacher and we will be using her end of the year check to pay off truck). 

Come September we will start contributing 10% each (for now) back into our retirement and 250 a month for our sons 529.

During this we will be slowly paying down my student loans with maybe an extra 500-1000 a month and putting the rest of our income into savings.

Hi guys,

So, after much consideration, my wife and I came to the decision that she is going to take a leave to stay home with our son and future infant (not planning yet).

We worked really hard over the last year to reduce our debt and monthly expenses and technically we have been living off of my salary alone since June. However, we have been using her salary to frivolously spend, which will come to a halt. 

She is a teacher and will finish out the year until June and then the leave will begin. Starting today we are going to live like we started the leave today. 

We are 29 years old have 2 paid off cars, 100k in home equity, 8k in savings, 60k in retirement, and 80k in student loans. 

Come June, we will have 28k in savings. 

We will be going from a combined income of 185k to ~110-115k from only my primary job. 

After paying living expenses (like I have been doing since June without issue), contributing 6% to my 401k (canâ€™t afford to do more,if we do this) my job will contribute 7%, and contributing 250 a month to our sons 529. We will be left with 300-400 extra a month to live on. 

I already have a second gig lined up for extra side income to help build savings. She plans to tutor virtually for some extra cash too. 

I am having a hard time because we have been using her income solely to save/pay off debt/ home renovations and have had some big goals for the next 2-5 years. Obviously, we will never get this time back again with the kids and that is priceless, so now, adjusting our financial goals.

We are 29 years old with a 1.5year old. Live in NY in a 1300sq foot house saving around 3700-4000 a month here but canâ€™t have another baby due to house size and child care issues. Trying to find our happy, and having a tough time. 

We have 2 paid off cars. I would sell my 2006 Camry and we would keep the 2019 vw tiguan that is paid off, so a new car would not be needed for at least 7-10 years, hopefully. This is probably the toughest decision weâ€™ve ever had to make and quite frankly, itâ€™s very scary. I want to do right for the family and our finances and future. 

Stay in NY with the hustle and bustle, both work, make great money, have a hard time ever upgrading in house (current 1300sq ft house is worth 525k). To stay around family, who we donâ€™t see that often anyway. 

Or move, get the bigger house, able to have another baby, wife stays home, family life is better, change of weather and life, but save less. Most of our savings in Ny would be geared for a new house eventually. 

Moving would decrease our overall debt about 100-120k.

nfses8,goodfight10,"How much car to buy.

Hi, a few days ago I made a post (which Iâ€™ve since deleted due to not enough information on my end) about possibly purchasing a 30k (used or new). 

A few of the responses said to do it, a few told me Iâ€™m in no position to spend that much. 

Here is a quick financial snapshot.

Married, 29 years old with combined income around 180-200k. 

Assets:

15k emergency fund. 

82k in retirement savings. (We paused for about a year to pay off debts).

~10k crypto investments. 

~2k for 18 month olds college 529

140k in home equity

Wifeâ€™s paid off car worth 23k currently. 

We have 81k in student loans. Recently refinanced around 52k of those for 700 a month for the next 5 years 

30k in federal loans on hold currently. 

Our net worth is somewhere around 200-220k. 

We both max our ROTH IRAâ€™s, I contribute 6% to a 401k and my employer contributes 7.5%. We also contribute around 500-1000 a month into crypto. Put 250 a month into our sons 529 and save around 2200-4400 in cash depending on the month. 

I usually buy used cars, drive them around and flip them for a few thousand more. Currently, donâ€™t have a car, and donâ€™t really NEED one. I work from home but really getting the itch for something new. 

Since the last post, Iâ€™ve came to the conclusion that maybe 30k for a toy is probably not justifiable at all in our situation. 

Would spending 15k-20k on a vehicle be detrimental to our future finances? I realistically could put down 5-9k on a car by next month and finance the rest. I find joy in going for drives and like to work on and take care of my cars. 

Would like to hear your opinions and also when do you find a balance on spending money on something that is going to depreciate instead of investing/saving every dollar you make? Or try to. TIA

I suppose I am looking for the OK and a specific dollar amount to go ahead and spend and not regret it financially. 

Edit: We spent a year reducing our consumer debt from 166k in 2019 to 82k by September 2020.  Now the only debt we have is our mortgage and student loans. We can be disciplined and totally have changed our spending habits for over 2 years now.",Yes,Yes,No,Yes,No
o7mzw9,goodfight10,"Sell our car to pay off debt, does this make sense?

So, I have 51k in private loans at 3.26% I just refinanced at 700.25 a month. 

Have 30k in federal loans on hold currently. 

That is our only debt (my debt). 

We collectively make 190-200k

We are 29 years old and have a combined net worth of ~250k-260k. That included retirement, home equity, paid off vehicles, etc. 

We have a 1.5 year old and are planning to have another baby soon. My wife is a teacher and we want her to be able to take a few years off with the next baby. 

To do that, we would need that 700/monthly student loan payment gone, so I can continue to contribute to retirement and our sons college fund. 

Here is my plan. I have a 2003 Tahoe she has a 2019 VW. We paid 30k for the VW in December 2018. Vroom offered us 23,500 now for the truck. 

Sell the VW, buy 1 more cheap commuter car, and sit on the money until September-October. Pay off the 51k in private loans, have around 5k left. Build our emergency fund back up to 15k by November-December. Save from December-June for a nicer car for my wife and the kids. End of June comes, we will be able to live comfortably off of 1 income. Going from 185-190k to 115-125k. 

Does this sound like a good plan? Is it over kill? Truck has 32k miles, 7 year 110k warranty. But, with used car prices the way they are now, if we sell, that means we drove for 30 months at 200/month. 

Thanks in advance. Looking forward to reading your responses.

Edit: if we donâ€™t sell the car to pay the loans, I could cover everything monthly when she stops working, but would have to stop college savings, stop maxing my Roth and probably decrease my 401k, which I donâ€™t think is the right move.",No,Yes,No,Yes,No

Hi all, 

30 years old, married with a 2 year old and planning for another.

Current income for this year: ~207k

Vehicles: 30k (paid off)

Our plan is to pay off the 48k in June to free up 700 a month to make the monthly a bit more relaxed. At that point, weâ€™ll go down to around 10k emergency fund and will be able to continue 401k investing, funding two 529 accounts (new baby), and saving around 100-300 a month extra.

s37x08,goodfight10,"Buying a used vs new car right now, advice needed.

Hi everyone. Here is my dilemma, we are in the market for a bigger suv for our growing family and need for bigger cargo space and use out of a truck. 

We currently have a 2019 vw tiguan we bought new in 2018 for 30,500 that is now paid off. 

It has 40k miles on it and we are being offered 26,000 from vroom. 

Here is the issue: We found (and put a 250 non refundable) deposit on a 2015 Toyota 4Runner SR5 also from vroom. 

The guys in r/4Runner say the price is crazy used and just buy new. 

The price is 34k plus tax and delivery fee for a 2015 SR5 with 85k miles. Theyâ€™re giving us 26k for our vw. I would sell my 2007 Avalon to pay off the remainder 10k almost immediately. 

This truck seems to check our boxes and I like the price point. I also like that itâ€™s a Toyota and will last longer than the Volkswagen with less expensive maintenance and repairs. 

A NEW 4Runner is approaching 40k and in this market (near me, an 8k mark up). This is way beyond what I want to spend. Iâ€™m ok with spending 35k because I wonâ€™t have to go into more debt or dig more into my pockets. 

Am I wrong for being ok with spending this on a used truck? I just DONT want to spend 40k+ on a new one.

Hey guys,

Iâ€™ve posted this quite a few times over the last year, but I am approaching the time to make a decision. 

Quick backstory: 30 y/o married, 1 toddler, 1 on the way in August. Since 2020 reduced our debt from 166k to now 68k which is only student loans. 

Combined income is 200-220k. My wife is taking the year off with the new baby, starting June, and will go down to 140-150k

Federal loans: 20,700 interest rates 3.8% or less. Currently on hold, will be 75 per month starting august. 

Private loans: 48,700 at 3.85% currently 293 a month

My question is, am I making the right move by paying off the 48,700 at a whole, this month? I understand the markets are down and it wouldnâ€™t be a guarantee to gain over time when paying off the debt is 100% guaranteed return of 3.8%. Iâ€™m like 99% towards paying the loan off. 

It would leave me with 17k left as an emergency fund (3 months) and I would be able to save 500-1500 a month depending on OT. (500 without OT). My wife wouldnâ€™t be working from June 2022 until September 2023 (Teacher). I will be continuing the 10% to my 401k and my employer contributes 7%. 

I keep asking this because the world keeps getting more expensive, constantly changing, and this would be one of the biggest sums of money Iâ€™ve spent at once. Also, making a big change by going down to one income. I want to make sure I am on the right path. 

Opinions? yet again. Thank you.

Hi guys,

I am 31 years old, 2 kids under 3, and married. 

I am the only income in my house. My base is 120k and I average around 16k in overtime with my full time job. 

I just started my own consulting business on the side and signed my first 1099 contract that will bring 30k-60k extra annually. I am trying to plan my investments ahead before I start saving for a new car/house upgrades/etc. Aiming for 160-180k for 2023. 

Currently I am putting 10% in my employee sponsored 401k. They are contributing 7% for a total of 17%. 

I am not contributing as of right now to 529â€™s for the kids because my wife just stopped working and I needed the cushion but now I am planning on starting again. 

So, should I increase my 401k to 17% to max the 401k. Then I am going to start contributing 500 to each childâ€™s 529, totaling 1000.

OR

Keep my 401k contributions where they are and contribute 500 a month (max) to my and my wifeâ€™s separate Roth IRAâ€™s for a total of 1000 a month. 

Does it matter which way I do it? Does having a 1099 contract through my single member LLC change anything for reducing taxable income? Each year I have been making more since I started work in 2016 and not sure if the business will be scaled or not. 

Looking forward to your advice, thanks again guys!",Yes,Yes,No,Yes,No

17m6tpm,googs185,"Evaluating if I should continue to stick with HDHP and HSA

In this hyperinflationary environment, our health insurance premiums are going up significantly with my current employer. We've been going with HSA over the past several years, even with our two young children, as we haven't had too many healthcare expenses. However, my wife and I are starting therapy together and it is costing $150/session, which is $600/month, and this changes the calculus a bit. I also may try to go to a few doctor visits for some GI issues I've been having, including possibly a naturopath. I'm wondering if the tax savings and potential for growth by investing continue to make sense for this year. 

1. The **HDHP** HSA plan is going from  $5160 to **$7600** per year in premiums for our family. $3200/$6400 individual/family deductible, $5k/10k OOP max. 10% coinsurance. $15 for generic meds. 

There are also 2 EPO plans available, one with a $0 deductible and another with a $2500 family deductible, as follows:

2.  **EPO 1: $10,500** yearly premium. $0 deductible. $4k/10k ind/family OOP max. Copays: $30 PCP/mental health visit, $50 specialist visit.    

3.   **EPO 2:  $7824** yearly premium. $1000/2500 ind/family deductible. $4.5/11.25k OOP max, 20% coinsurance. $20 PCP/mental health visits. $50 specialist visit. 

&#x200B;

I was crunching the numbers and it seems that, just with $156/session therapy 4x/month, I would pay $6400 (deductible) plus $171 coinsurance = $6571. I then would add $7632/year in premiums and subtract the $480/year that my employer contributes to my HSA to get to a yearly total of: **$13723** out of pocket for the year (and any other care before/after therapy would be subject to the 10% coinsurance up to $10k). I'd also have a larger network, the PPO plans are limited to in-network providers only.

Plan 2 above would be $30 per therapy visit x 52= $1560. I would add that to the yearly premium of $10560 to equal **$12120** out of pocket. 

Plan 3 above would be $20 per therapy visit x 52= $1040. He only bills insurance for me, so that would make us hit my yearly individual deductible of $1000 (and still have $1500 to hit for family deductible). Adding the $1040 to the yearly premium of $7824 would be **$8864** out of pocket for the year. We would have a 20% coinsurance if anything major happened and $1500 more to spend for the family until we hit our family deductible as well. There is a large $11,250 OOP family max (4.5k individual) so that would be an extra $2250 in a worst case scenario. 

Looking quickly at the numbers makes it look like **plan 3** would make the most sense, but I want to make sure that the tax savings of the HSA and potential investment growth could outweigh the $4859 difference in yearly cost between premiums and therapy visits (and not taking into account any other major medical expenses for the year).

Iâ€™ve been wanting to post this for a long time and Iâ€™m finally doing it! Please forgive the length of the post.

Iâ€™m currently on the path to FIRE but there is a significant obstacle in the way. Some backstory: While I was living at home with my parents, they made me give them $500 a week that they were â€œputting awayâ€ for me for when I got married/bought a house. The balance reached $30,000 before I got married. We got married and the money wasnâ€™t available (because the money was tied up in one of their houses that my sister and brother in law were living in but couldnâ€™t get a mortgage on because he works under the table). When we went to buy a house 3 years later, they still didnâ€™t have the money because my sister still hadnâ€™t taken over the mortgage. That is problem #1. When we went to buy a house, we were in a rush, unfortunately. We were kicked out of our apartment because the town had purchased the property and the building was going to be demolished. We didnâ€™t want another year lease and decided to start looking for a house. Our former landlord let us live in his basement apartment for a couple of months while we looked. We looked at many houses with our real estate agent and I think she became fed up with showing us so many houses. We looked at houses of all sizes but decided on a very small house, well below my means, to keep expenses down and hasten our journey to FIRE. We found one in the town I grew up in Connecticut and it was listed for $220k, a short sale.  It was on a nice, quiet street within walking distance of the elementary, middle and high schools. There were already 8 bids on the house and our RE agent made us put in a $255k bid, saying we wouldnâ€™t get it if we didnâ€™t (which I think was exorbitant, and I feel that the other bids were LOWER than $220k). The bid, of course, was accepted. I donâ€™t know how, but the house comped on the bank assessment and we were given the mortgage at 3.375%. 

 Here start the problems: The house is a ranch and only 1050 square feet and only has one bathroom with a plastic corner shower (no bath). It has two bedrooms with very small closets and another room without a closet-so only two bedrooms. There is no upstairs living room or dining room, just a space when you walk in that is serving as our dining room in front of the fireplace and picture window. The basement, fortunately, is finished, and the family room is down there, but we need to use electric heaters down there. The furnace is low-efficiency, the cheapest the previous owner could put in. We found out the house was owned by a previously very rich family that lost everything. They didnâ€™t care about the house, as they didnâ€™t plan on staying there. The house was built in the late 1940s, block construction, with no insulation in the walls. It can get cold in the winter and hot in the summer due to lack of insulation and we canâ€™t add insulation without reframing all the interior walls.  The previous owner was a hack and did a lot of work unprofessionally, causing me more work. The lawn and landscaping were horrible, many trees needed to be taken down, I needed to put in new gutters and fascia and spent countless hours removing ivy from the house.  The rear patio had to be replaced since the former owner built it up to the level of the rear door and water would come in the house. The front porch was rotting and I had to have masonry stairs put in. In short, Iâ€™ve probably spent over $20k in upgrades and repairs in the past 3 years weâ€™ve owned the house.  What is worse, our neighborâ€™s house, which is much nicer just sold for $279k. An old lady lived there and kept it immaculate and well-maintained. It  is 1800 sq feet, has 5 bedrooms, 2.5 bathrooms, sunroom and a 2 car garage (we have one car garage). From what my RE agent tells me, we are in a sellerâ€™s market now. When I saw what it sold for, I was fumigating.

I just donâ€™t know what to do. I feel we severely overpaid for the house, we have PMI because I was screwed by my parents on the $30k.  All of the reasons we bought a small house for (savings on utilities, taxes, maintenance, etc) seem to be completely irrelevant and we really arenâ€™t saving much than we wouldâ€™ve paid on a larger home.  Iâ€™m looking for advice. Should we get out of this home? Despite itâ€™s shortcomings, the house is very cute and has curb appeal. It has stucco, which is atypical for our area. The neighborhood is very nice. The school system is top notch. We live very close to my parents and sister/brother in law so they can help with our baby at times. I donâ€™t want to dump money and put an addition on it to bring it up to the houses around it. A local contractor wanted $85k just to increase the size of the master bedroom, add a bathroom and increase the size of the bonus room to add a closet to make it a bedroom. I know Iâ€™ll need to at least add a bath and redo the ONE bathroom it has.

My financial situation: Iâ€™m 31. I make $130k a year, my wife stays home with our infant daughter. I have $28k left in student loan debt currently at a 1.9% interest rate that will be paid off in less than two years. We have one paid off car (a cheap beater to get to work, which is less than 5 miles from my home), and a reliable car with one more year of payments on it. Iâ€™m maxing out my employer 401k  ($19k)and  Roth IRA and  have $20k in an emergency fund. Current investments in retirement funds were at $40k before the crash. I also have about $25k in my checking account ready to use for investing or real estate.

Sorry for the long-winded story. Any advice or suggestions would be appreciated. Again, my goal is to FIRE as soon as possible. Iâ€™m not sure if we should sell the home or stay in it. Iâ€™m not sure if I should start investing in real estate or dump more in the stock market. Thank you!",Yes,Yes,No,Yes,Yes

I realize these arenâ€™t mutually exclusive but each author of books like Set for Life and The Simple Path to Wealth can make one seem better than the other. Proponents of each say their way is better. Real Estate (house hacking and leveraging) seems to produce faster wealth and returns but it seems like a LOT of work.

I  have a 19 month old daughter and wife that will be on my health  insurance policy as I'm currently switching jobs. We plan on having  another baby in the next year.  I've always done HDHP to get the triple  tax benefit of the HSA as a retirement vehicle, but is this worth it  with a baby and having another child next year?

**HDHP:**

In network family deductible: $5600, also has out of network deductible (much higher)

$8000 Out of pocket max

10% coinsurance

Have to pay everything out of pocket until deductible is met.

Unfortunately, no single person deductible, everyone contributes to the family deductible.

**EPO Plan:**

$2500 deductible

$11,225 out of pocket max

20% coinsurance

Limited to in-network only

Offers  copays instead of deductibles for specialist visits ($20 non specialist  visit, $50 specialist visit, $75 Urgent Care, $400 ER)

px1e6u,googs185,"Changing insurance plan during open enrollment for upcoming birth!

Hey guys, I've been crunching the numbers over and over again to see if it makes sense to pay for a better insurance plan during open enrollment. We're on the path to FIRE right now and savings rate is very important so every decision counts. My wife is currently pregnant with a due date in April. Open enrollment is now and starts in November. I've always used HSAs with HDHPs because I like the triple tax benefit but I'm wondering if it makes sense to increase my premium payments to $774/month for the EPO with no deductible instead of $438 for the HDHP.  I would change back to the HDHP the day after our child is born (qualifying event). The numbers are as follows:.

&amp;#x200B;

* **HDHP**
* $438/month with $2800 deductible and $4500 out of pocket max, 10% coinsurance. Employer pays $40/month into HSA.  6 month cost = $2628 (minus the $240  employer contribution = $2388).
* $2388 + $2800 individual deductible = **$5138** *(plus 10% of costs between $2800 and 4500 , unsure what total bill will be-if bill is over $4500, it would be another* ***$450,*** *bringing the above total to* ***$5588***\*.\*
* **UPDATE**: Family deductible is $5600 with a family out of pocket limit of $9000. If we give birth at the same hospital, we can add **$1300** to the above total for the bill for my child.  That would bring the above total to **$6,888**. Since my daughter wouldn't meet her deductible of $2800, we would miss meeting the family deductible, and in the worst case scenario that both my wife and daughter reach their deductibles of $2800 each, that would be an additional $2800 out of pocket. That would make the final total, including the above premiums for 6 months, **$7888** plus 10% of the bill between $5600 and $9000 (family out-of-pocket limit)

\----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

* **EPO $0 deductible**
* $774/month with $0 deductible, $10000 family out- of- pocket max, $750 hospital admission copay (birth) $30 sick visit copay, $50 specialist copay.  6 month cost = $4644
* $4644 + $750 (hospital admission for birth) = **$5394**

\----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

* **EPO $1000 deductible**
* $500/month with $1000 individual deductible/$2500 family deductible, $4500 out of pocket max individual/ $11,250 family, 20% coinsurance. 6 month cost = $3000. 
* $3000 + $1000 individual deductible = **$4000** *(plus 20% of costs between $1000 and $4500 , unsure what total bill will be-if bill is over $4500, it would be another* ***$700,*** *bringing the above total to* ***$4700***
* Family deductible is $2500 with a family out of pocket limit of $11,500. At the hospital for our last birth, our new baby was charged $1300 for services. If my wife's birth costs $4500 like last time after insurance discounts, she would hit the deductible but the family would have to hit the family out of pocket max of $11,500 so we'd be on the hook for 20% from $4500 up to $11,500, which would be another $1400 and bring the final  total, including premiums for 6 months, to **$6100**.   

Edit: The above-listed deductible for the HDHP is an INDIVIDUAL deductible just for my wife. The family deductible is $5600. This may change the math because our new baby will also receive a bill. We received a bill of around $1300 for nursery charges for our daughter when she was born.

We rarely go to see a doctor since we are young and healthy and I work in medicine and can take care of basic medical needs/prescriptions for my family to avoid the sick visit copays.

I'm assuming the birth will cost around $4000-$5000, based on the cost of the birth of our first child at the same hospital, but there were some complications during that birth, so I'm not sure.

I do max out HSA contributions and I'm not calculating how much I would lose in investment income by not contributing for 6 months. I'd miss out on contributing $3550 tax free and reducing my taxable information by that amount over the 6 months. I think I'd only make a few hundred dollars banking on a 15% return in VTSAX in my HSA (based on last year's market performance-I know we could be going into a recession as well), but I'm trying to figure out if the tax savings would be significant enough to warrant keeping the HDHP plan. The tax savings should be about $1300 figuring a 30% tax bracket. Therefore, the HDHP would be **$6588**  figuring that in.

Without W2, since it wonâ€™t be produced till next year, how do I know what is my actual gross income for this year? Since I move twice I canâ€™t go off the straight annual since I havenâ€™t worked 12 months at any of those. Especially since I had some OT so actual pay is higher than â€œannual divided by 12â€. 

Second is, how do I lower it by contributing to traditional 401k or maybe FSA/HSA or if thereâ€™s sth else (never used those before) so my income bracket is all at 12%? (I think I got up to around 80k? So need 20k out...) is it too late to do that at this point of the year?

So I started doing an HSA this year through my employee benefits, and it is through UMB Bank.

If I wait until the end of the year can I transfer that to a Fidelity HSA? Or will the wait with not having the money being invested not be worth just paying the $3/month. I'm also wondering if I would be better off just doing it through Fidelity on my own each year, I do like the idea it lowering my taxable income though since coming out pretax on my paychecks.

fk6tpg,GRaTePHuLDoL,"Question about my ESPP while out of work due to you know what

So I started a ESPP with Hilton this year, I contributed the full 15% and we get a 15% discount, so I was looking forward to seeing how I'd make out when the first purchase period ends on 4/30, but due to COVID-19 I'm pretty much out of work for the foreseeable future. I have about three months of emergency funds saved up, but I don't know how long this is going to last, especially since summer usually slows down a bit anyway. 

I'm wondering if there's any negatives to withdrawing my current contributions, or maybe half of it. I figure by the end April we should hopefully have a better idea of how long these closures and what not will last for. My individual account as well as my Roth account are taking hard hits right now so I'd rather not touch them.

I was under the impression it does a look back purchase, so even with the 15% discount if I sold right away I guess I'd technically still be up more than if I withdrew, as long as it doesn't drop more than 15% that day, which I haven't seen it drop more than 5-10% in a day so far. Not sure if I'd get taxed again after selling though.

This is the wording for the lookback, which is kind of confusing:  
Employee Stock Purchase Price will be the lower of the beginning or the end of the Offering Period  (1/13/20 - 4/30/20) using the Closing Price on that Day.

My employee HSA is through UMB .. and I'm trying to figure out what I should do with it moving forward. I am currently being ""furloughed"" come March 26th, for possibly the next 3-6 months, depending on the current state of the world. I currently have $819.20 in it, as I just started it this year, but I was doing max contributions. Now it's my understanding that once I reach a balance of $1000, I can invest any ADDITIONAL funds in it. Since I am only being furloughed, all my benefits stay active, just I am responsible for making my monthly payments, instead of the payroll deductions.

What I'm wondering, since it's kind of pointless to add to it without getting the pre-tax deduction, and I can't invest the initial $1000, if I'd be better off just withdrawing it for now and taking the tax hit, and starting over once I get back to work. Or if I should just leave it be and only take it out if I absolutely need it.

Hello all,

The first purchase period ended yesterday with $HLT's new ESPP. Due to the lookback it ended up purchasing at $64.35/share, so I now own 42 shares. I don't really need the money right now, and wouldn't even really see that much of a profit if I had sold right away (\~$300). So I am wondering if I would be better off at least waiting for the Qualified Disposition Date of 01/13/2022 before thinking about selling, for the tax benefits. Now I do believe $HLT will be able to get back to where it once was at around $115/share once all is said and done with the current state of affairs, as they've already lasted 100 years through plenty of other crazy times, but I'm also wondering how beneficial this actually will be to me moving forward if I'm only going to be looking at upwards of 15% gains(saying I don't hold and sell right away, during normal times), or if my money would be better off invested elsewhere. With that being said though I did miss the past two months of contributions due to being furloughed.

Anyways, this was my first foray into the market so any information is greatly appreciated!

\*Originally asked in r/realestate but just got downvoted to hell without any insight so if this isn't the right place for this either feel free to delete, but I don't know who else to ask

Hello, hope everyone is well.

I am currently in the market for a new apartment, I've been in my current apartment for the past 18 months with no issues however they are starting construction on several units in January so I'm trying to get a head start and get moved into a new place ASAP so I can help offset the move in costs instead of just paying another 2-3 months rent here that will go towards nothing. I'm trying to keep the monthly rent around $1200, which is average for a 1/1 in my area. There are a couple issues I'm a bit worried about though:

1. I am currently furloughed with full benefits from work due to the pandemic. I work for a large prominent resort in the area that pretty much everyone knows about but it could still be a few months before we go back. I have a comfortable savings, investments, am still able to collect $1100/month from unemployment insurance, and will be getting my deposit back from my landlord. I have very low expenses elsewhere and have zero doubt in my mind that I would ever have issues paying my monthly rent.
2. I have an attempted burglary charge from 2015. Long story short, it was something I had nothing to do with, wrong place wrong time, I spent lots of $$ on an attorney and fought the best I could but had to settle with probation, and after a few hiccups I completed it successfully and have NO felony conviction. It hasn't affected my past three jobs that ran background checks.. my current one, another hotel, and a country club in a gated community. My current apartment was taken over from a friend so my current landlords didn't run one due to a good word of mouth recommendation from my friend who had been here for three years previously.
3. I don't have any rental history on record besides what my current landlord could verify over the past 18 months. I've never rented something by myself before this. My credit score is 650+ according to CK as I've been working on rebuilding it over the past two years and I have no serious debt or collections on my report, nor any type of eviction history.

What are my chances of getting past the application process? Am I better off trying to stick to private owners? Realtors? Large apartment communities? I tried to supply as much info as possible but if there's anything else I could add that would help let me know. I appreciate any type of info/recommendations/suggestions anyone could offer.

My old employer, Hilton, started their first ESPP last year, I opted in for the max deduction of 15%, pandemic hit, we became furloughed in March, and eventually laid off a month ago. I was able to purchase 42 shares with $2700 at a 15% discount of $64. It has finally made it's way back to where it was before the pandemic hit, at around $110-115 per share. With the current state of the hospitality industry, and after looking at market forecasts, I don't see it climbing much higher over the next year. The purchase date was 4/30/20 so I believe in order to trigger a Qualifying Disposition I would have to wait two years from that date to sell. I am trying to decide if it is worth it to wait, or to sell and rebalance. Due to the pandemic my 2020 income was about $42,000 and I don't expect it to be any higher this year so I should still be in a lower tax bracket.

rztxfg,grsdjotc,"Idk what to do with my money. Idk if quitting my job is worth it. I need help but idk who to talk to about jobs and finances.

I (24f) am in graduate school for social work and work 2 1/2 jobs (a half bc one is more like a hobby). Iâ€™m taking out loans to pay for school, so grad and undergrad loans will be deferred until 2025. Until then I am saving in an account that gives 3% APY. I have set aside enough to pay off my undergraduate unsubsidized loans so when the time comes, I wonâ€™t pay interest on them. No kids, live alone, long-term partner/plans to marry in 3-5 years, and I own my car. I want to do something now to grow my wealth by then but idk what to do. 

I wanted to buy a house to house hack but havenâ€™t found a good deal for me yet and need a new realtor. Iâ€™m also a bit wishy washy, so getting into debt for the wrong property is a real and scary possibility. Iâ€™m trying to hold out, keep learning, be patient but Iâ€™m also a trauma survivor who was recently triggered by a neighbor and now desperately wants to move out. Right now I pay $1,079 but found a cheaper place to rent for $799. I plan to move next month to get away and save money. Iâ€™ve also found that properties in my area would run for just a few hundred extra bucks than Iâ€™m paying now, which I feel I could afford , especially with a roommate and ofc once married. Not looking for our forever home but obviously will be ready to live there until we marry and then sell, rent it out, or stay put. 

I work my full time job as a crisis call center specialist working 36 hours a week for $17 an hour and expect to eventually be given 3% annual raises â€œprojected to start January 2022â€. 

I work my second, temporary contract job as a rental assistance case manager 32 hours a week for $19 an hour but want to quit or possibly replace it with a super part job making around a lot less probably ($10-20). I start an unpaid grad school internship in two weeks, making replacing this job with something better a little difficult and honestly Iâ€™m tired lol and want to be off more. I ultimately want to quit due to differing Covid views and feeling that my health is at risk for no reason since they advertised the job as a WFH position but want me to come in to work near Covid positive ppl (albeit only once a week for 4 hours). 

I work my â€œhalfâ€ job at 6 hours a week for $12 an hour. 

My grad school loans cover tuition and living costs, so I am able to save my income. I have been spending a lot and have had to tap into my income account twice but have saved around $17,000 and counting (minus the set aside amount $9,576 or something for unsubsidized loans). And I have an Acorns account but have been advised by Redditors to switch to Fidelity. 

What else should I be doing? Would quitting be immature or a mistake financially? Should I quit, not fill that time so I can rest (or get a PT remote job that pays much less but still pays) and live on my savings until finding a good fit to replace my second job or begin door dashing instead of getting into another commitment?

s01lfc,grsdjotc,"Part Time Financial Workshop Representative. Does this sound legit?

Itâ€™s with the Premier Advisor Group and was found on handshake which I trust and have gotten several jobs on throughout the years. 

After looking on the website, I see that their parent company is Primerica, which Iâ€™ve heard bad things about. Itâ€™s got me questioning the legitimacy of this position. 

Itâ€™s offering a lot for only 10-15 hours a week. The company will fully fund getting the State Life license, federal series 6, and series 63 financial advisor license. Iâ€™m not really sure what those words mean yet, but it says no financial experience is necessary. Oh, and 10-15 hours will usually compensate around $1,000-2,000.

se1xa9,grsdjotc,"How to delegate my income?

Hello! Iâ€™m (24-25f) about to move in with roommates to cut down on rent and be closer to uni. I have 2 jobs and a hobby that pays, and Iâ€™m in grad school. One of the jobs is a temporary contract that is set to end in August 2022 but may end sooner if the program ends or if I eventually get fired from being too tired to work (slight joke, slight hope but itâ€™s great work and great for my resume). Anywho, I am hoping to get advice on how to allocate my income now that my expenses will be reduced. 

At my FT job, I make $17.85 an hour with an annual 3% increase and health insurance for like $250 a pay check, I think. Health insurance will start getting taken out beginning February 2022. I work 36 hours a week. I think thatâ€™s $1,224 a month. 

At my temporary job, I make $19 an hour and work 32 hours a week, although Iâ€™ve been working a little less lately bc Iâ€™ve been tired af now that Iâ€™ve started my field placement twice a week for my MSW. I think thatâ€™s $1,216 a month. 

I typically donâ€™t count my income from my hobby but itâ€™s at $12 an hour, 6 hours a week. 

Now that my rent is going down from $1079 plus utilities to $600 (no utilities), I am wondering what to do with that â€œextraâ€ income. I also pay $1,217.58 every 6 months for car insurance, $90 a month for my phone bill, $9 for Netflix, probably like $50 a month for gas, and I spend a lot on food (Iâ€™d guess $500 a month for me and my partner). Oh and probably about $300 a month for entertainment.  That comes to about $1,550 a month with $890 left over. 

How should I allocate $890 a month? Once the contact runs up, Iâ€™m strongly considering NOT replacing the temporary job. Will I be able to sustain that? I have about 18k saved up with 9k going to completely cover my student loans unsubsidized loans when they start to accrue interest.",Yes,Yes,No,Yes,No
skmptr,grsdjotc,"What are the good/common/trustworthy IRA providers?

Iâ€™m having a hard time trusting anywhere. I donâ€™t know much about this, maybe I should pay for a financial advisor tbh. 

My company is supposed to do a 3% match but says we donâ€™t have a provider right now. They told me to go to https://www.capitalgroup.com/individual/, choose individual investor, and then find a provider. Once I do that give them my companyâ€™s name as the â€œsponsorâ€ and my payroll deduction plan number. Does this mean once I found a provider, they will match my contributions?

They sent that in may of 2021. I was overwhelmed with it all and quit basically. I met with primerica but it felt scammy. So I put my money in an account that earns 3% APY. I also use Acorn but donâ€™t like it bc of the fees and want to switch but donâ€™t know who to switch too. Now Iâ€™m upset with myself bc itâ€™s been 8 months that they couldâ€™ve been matching if I understand that correctly.

I feel like an jerk (profanity is not allowed) sometimes when I see these numbers. Why are we all so poor? In a two person household, each person would need to make around $2,500. I (24f) make around $3,500 living by myself. Ofc I work multiple jobs and Iâ€™m exhausted but just one of my jobs makes 2k a month. With my partner making the same, weâ€™ll be fine. (My current expenses on my own rn is around 2k a month, no kids). 

I get it if you have kids. Kids are expensive af. I get it if you have student debt, but that can be factored into the 5k a month. I ofc get it if you have a felony and I think itâ€™s awful how little jobs are available for ppl with a record. 

But I looked it up, and to make 60k a year, both ppl would only need to make $15 an hour which where I am is NOT the minimum wage but from what I hear, in lots of places it is. I say that to say, in lots of places, you and your partner both only need to make minimum wage to make this happen.

ubqhjy,grsdjotc,"Would it be wiser to just put my money in a retirement fund?

I am feeling defeated. Iâ€™ve been house hunting for awhile and have come to terms with the fact that now may just not be the time for me. I have great credit and a sizeable down payment but my debt to income ratio is too high for the condos I tend to like. My realtor is about done and asked me if I want to pray about it today (LOL, im agnostic) so I guess sheâ€™s tired of being my agent. Should I just give it up and spend my money elsewhere?

Iâ€™ve been thinking of other ways to become financially wealthy or set myself up for success (25f). Maybe I should just open a simple IRA with my job so I can get a match. Iâ€™ve been holding off bc I was saving all income for buying a house (eventual investment property). The other part of it is idk that I want to be here forever but I didnâ€™t think that would matter much since I can live in it until my partner and I marry and move and then rent it out since it would be near uni. 

Should I just open a simple IRA and look for other ways to make my money grow? I think I would just keep the downpayment and emergency fund and plan to invest incoming money into simple IRA, that way I still have liquid funds to use for those goals. At first, *all* income was going towards downpayment to offset income ratio but now I think instead of adding to down payment, I should start investing elsewhere because I feel like Iâ€™m at a standstill. The dilemma is if I put the money in a retirement fund, I really wonâ€™t be able to get a house bc I wonâ€™t be growing my down payment anymore. So at first it made sense to just keep adding to the housing pool. But now, I feel like that goal is so far off until I get another source of income so instead of wasting my life waiting on this goal, I should just invest elsewhere.",Yes,Yes,No,Yes,Yes
uye9bi,grsdjotc,"Deal or No Deal? Rocket Mortgage Loan.

I am approved with a local lender and with Rocket Mortgage (RM) but the local lender has been non-responsive and lackadaisical throughout my homebuying process. I donâ€™t want to work with him but donâ€™t want to hurt myself in the long run by getting a bad deal. 

RM will help with the offer letter, title loan, and all other documents from origination to close. Iâ€™m not sure if thatâ€™s something my local lender helps with but I have not been happy with his services so far. Iâ€™m second guessing whether to reach out to him because I hear Iâ€™ll be doing myself a disservice if I donâ€™t shop around and that RM has bad rates but would not choose to work with him and their rates were exactly the same. Here is what my RM lender has shared with me. 

From Rocket Mortgage: 
* 30 year fixed conventional borrow with smart Freddie Mac that will give a $1,250 credit towards closing. 
* Offer price $77,500
* 5% or $3,875 down payment (should I put 10% down?) 
* $73,625 loan
* Monthly payment: 
    * Principal and interest $435 
    * Taxes $35 a month 
    * Mortgage insurance $20 a month
    * Walls in insurance $15 a month 
    * HOA $217 a month

* $500 appraisal 
* $6,184 to close (put more down?)
* 5.875% insurance rate. Refinance later. 
* AM Rock for title

Is this a solid buy? Note: it appraises very slowly from what Iâ€™ve seen, likely due to being in relatively high crime area and only accepting cash or conventional loans. This area also happens to be walking distance to my large campus so it is easily rentable. My partner has lived right next door for years and the only problems weâ€™ve had are stolen bikes and broken tail lights. 

I just spoke with the hoa director who says there are no rental restrictions short or long term.

w3ybt4,grsdjotc,"Should I (25f) add the max towards retirement while I can? Should I get out of deferment and start paying back my student loans?

Hey yâ€™all, please lmk if Iâ€™m on the right track. Iâ€™m in graduate school and Iâ€™ve been getting financial aid and will continue for the next two years. FYI, financial aid covers tuition and living expenses which has allowed me to save the income I receive from work. Some say this isnâ€™t wise, but itâ€™s allowed me to use my employment income to buy a house last month! Now, Iâ€™m brainstorming what to do next. 

As the title says, Iâ€™m considering using my income to get out of deferment early and start paying back my student loans while my income is low and bills are paid for. My job is eligible for the public loan forgiveness program so if I start now, the rest of my undergraduate loans will be forgiven by 35yo and all I will have left are graduate student loans. Is this a good move?

Iâ€™m also considering using my income to contribute to my retirement. My employer gives a 3% match and the most I can contribute is $500 a month (6k a year for a simple IRA 408b plan) so I am thinking of doing that. This is something I wouldnâ€™t be able to afford without financial aid, so I figure I ought to do it while I can. Then in 2 years when I graduate and likely have to stop contributing as much, Iâ€™ll have two years worth of contributing under my belt. Good idea?",Yes,Yes,No,Yes,No

But every single self driving company has a different strategy and no one has EVER built full fsd ever. And there are estimates that it will be in the 2040s before it's made. Do peoppe understand this? Cause essentially enron did the same thing with their accounting and that's what got them into trouble they counted Capex as profit. So a company can do all sorts of things with its accounting.

It seems shocking to me that so many people down vote the last post I did so I went and looked up the quarterly report.

16zc1ly,happy2lucky,"Question on long term care insurance

Hello All-

I am sure some of you may have gone through this analysis at some point. 

I am searching on this desperately but not able to find comprehensive information. I am 43, F and expecting some long term care needs. I read a few articles around long term care insurance, hybrid insurance with LTC rider and Annuities with LTC rider

We (married filing jointly) max out our pretax 401k, HSA and do backdoor/mega Roth periodically depending on cash situation. Generally we are late starters in our career (my husband started working at 33 and I started at 35). He is 47 and I am 43 now. So there are balances but not huge ones. We plan to retire in late 50s

We have zero inheritance money wise but life wise our ancestors mostly lived into their early 90s ðŸ˜€ðŸ˜€. Some of them needed long term care. I developed a condition that â€˜mayâ€™ need long term care.

Some questions I have:
1. I see that traditional IRA is a better way to save for long term care needs because of tax benefit. 
However, traditional IRA also kicks in RMDs which would eventually decrease my Social Security. Would that be the case when I claim RMDs for my long term care credits? Will I still have the tax torpedo?

2. Regardless of savings in Traditional IRA, I feel the need for additional income stream to cover for my long term care needs. I see that there are three options:
a. Long term care insurance (I am ruling this out because I heard the policies are no longer reliable or good with benefits. Moreover they are use it or lose it ones)
b. Hybrid life insurance- permanent life insurance with Long term care rider
c. Deferred Annuity with long term care rider

I am not sure what are the differences between b and c. 

What are the features that weigh for them and against them?

3. Medicaid eligibility:
I read that having cash value life insurance policies and annuities weigh against you for Medicaid claims around long term care. 

Point to note though, my spouse and I are not low income earners. Not high but not low either. I am wondering if I should even bother about Medicaid at this point?
 

Apologies for such a long post, but I am really looking to cover for my retirement and given long term care needs that my health demands, trying to be financially and physically responsible. Appreciate any insight you may have

mm1lun,happy2lucky,"Transfer (from community college) vs freshman

Hello all-  My kids are no way near to college. Trying to understand the community college route vs regular freshmen.  

What are the opportunity costs ( for now letâ€™s assume it is for a decent out of state college)
- at undergraduate level?
- in terms of long term career?

I think I am good if they get into in state tuition (GA covers with HOPE scholarship, and I think I am okay with boarding costs). I also believe he has good chances to get into UGA. However, I am currently wondering about 2 scenarios below:

My son (rising 9th grader) does dream of Stanford/UCLA - mostly influenced by his friends who moved from CA (I am originally from LA too, so no issues there). However, I want him to be realistic with out of state tuition funding and debts. So in case he wants to persist with these choices with his current Bs, I would want him to buy some extra time at a community college. Although I wonder if it is even possible to a CA university from a GA community college. 

Question here: Is it possible?

GA Tech: I am also wondering of a scenario where he does not make the GPA cut that is needed for HOPE scholarship and therefore should buy some time at community college till they take to the rigor to head out to CA universities for better career prospects. I donâ€™t think community college to GA Tech is nearly possible (very tough competition). His interest is in sciences (health/bio etc)

Are there any long term career impacts if they do not join as freshman? I can bring in a bit of additional savings, and may be some loans if the â€˜freshmanâ€™ tag is really worth it. But I am more inclined to community college and then CA, this way we can buy time and reduce stress.

msr1vn,happy2lucky,"IUL/VUL and all the permanent life policies- WTF are they?

Understandably this question might have been asked several hundred times, I am asking again with very specific questions.

Basics out - 
1. Yes, we max out the retirement contributions and in mid 40s. He has 8 years total work experience and I have 5. Yes, we had our share of struggles and started careers late.
Backdoor done. mega Roth eligibilities not existing. Will top up when we hit 50. I am a private tutor and can pool up that money
2. Did reasonable college funding (75k NW in each childâ€™s 529 account. They are 14 and 11)
3. Only my employer offers High deductible plan and I take for only me. So HSA is saved for individual NOT family 
4. We have a home and 300k mortgage. Good prepayment going on (about $450 extra pm)
5. We have a term policy for 30 years that expires when we turn 70. We expect to live up to 90

Now the freaking questions:

I reached out to a neighborhood advisor because I heard of these insurance income paying plans that payout living+death benefit. I was hoping some guaranteed inheritance to kids upon our death (term is guaranteed only if I die before 70)

This guy confused me by changing assumptions once every minute. It was a 2 hour presentation and I understood â€˜Nilâ€™. It shows millions being built with thousands and millions in death benefit. I just got confused between all changing numbers and assumptions. It was frustrating. Someone please help me understand the below:

what am I looking for? 

- I am looking to pass down some death benefit to kids (which would be their living benefit)

- retirement distribution plan:

Ages 60-70 - traditional IRA/401k;
Ages 70-80 - SS + Roth accounts;
Ages 80-90 - SS + This insurance income; (I hope to die and pass on some benefit to kids to cover my funeral cost)
Ages 90 plus - I donâ€™t know, itâ€™s kids fate.

This idiotic advisor confused me to the core. I donâ€™t know what is the best move.

Do these policies deliver on their promise? Will these really cover for me in my 80s?

He suggested some 40k premium for 5 years (my 41 to 45) and some 90k income per year (80-90) and I think 50k death benefit. 

On my request he put the growth rate assumption to 6% for the above policy.

mtx03y,happy2lucky,"Funding college with rental property??

Hello All

I posted this question on Dave Ramsey Reddit thread. Sorry if some of you may have to reread it.

So here is the question. I was told about a long term strategy to fund kids education. On the book this looks pitch perfect. Not sure if this works in real world and real money, because things are barely certain here. Can someone explain the â€˜unseenâ€™ downside of this?

So here is how the strategy works. When a baby is born:

1. Find a rental property and down 20%
2. Get a 15 year mortgage 
3. Find tenants who will pay well above the monthly payment 
4. Use that rent to pay off mortgage 
5. The home is paid up by renter in 15 years
6. Just about the college time, refi the home with 80% cash out. This is a non taxable event 
7. The renter paying the mortgage cycle restarts

The extra rent collected covers the maintenance and vacant costs over 15 years is the idea (while tax benefits from depreciation and mortgage also add up to this benefit)

I donâ€™t know if this really works but this is the strategy. I may not do this (my kids are 14&amp;11), but curious to understand.

mw4hhx,happy2lucky,"Fact check help. In state vs Out of state tuition

Hello bros-

I am asking this just to validate my understanding regarding PUBLIC universities only

Background-
My kids are 4 years away from college and I saved decent, if not exorbitant, for the college. In-state tuition would be a breeze but may need additional funding for out of state. Also, I am not against the idea of community college but I want to clear my head with correct understanding of the concept

I heard/gathered the following from others regarding out of state tuition 
1. Out of state tuition will become in state tuition following one year of residency. Somehow I assumed this to be in state tuition from year 2 onwards. 

2. Out of state tuition will remain so for all four years because it is the parents residency that matters

Hello peeps 

I understand IUL/VUL are for high earners only. We are high earners but started way too late in life and therefore we donâ€™t have net worth enough to go for IUL/VUL

Our high earnings will help us fund retirement accounts and to some extent college accounts (not interested in full funding for kids). With the rest of the money I was thinking of permanent life policies.

Again, I donâ€™t think I should buy one, but I am curious on who are the eligible buyers for this without losing money? If I buy for my kids (who are 14&amp;11) would that be beneficial?

The reason I ask is: these policies are good for people with high net worth and taxable estates. I donâ€™t have estates but if I live the simple life I am in and keep earning the same for next 20+ years my kids might have an estate. So wondering if it is for individuals like them?

The idea is not to buy, but to understand this product. Every other month some or the other advisor chances upon me with different variations of this product (IUL/VUL/FIUL/IA/VA) and all the riders. Every one I know runs away from these guys (so do I), then who are they selling to? Just curious on how can I really use this product into my asset mix, if at all.

Hi peeps-

My spouse switched jobs. 

His previous employer offered after tax and with all the calculations I estimated employers contribution plus his pretax limit (19,500) and funded the remainder to his after tax 401k

Now, his new employer offers after tax as well. I know pre tax contribution cannot cross 19,500 but I read somewhere that doctors do after tax contributions to all their employer plans at 58,000 each plan with out crossing the pretax limit. Is this possible for people who are not doctors?

Slightly confused and would like some insight.

Can my husband (not a doc, just a simple Corp employee) contribute to after tax at new employer as well (keeping 19,500 pretax in tact) ?

Example below to explain myself better:

Employer 1:
Pretax 401k contribution =17,000
Employer contribution = 1,500 (could have been 2000 had he stayed up to year end)
After tax contribution = 36,500

(I fund my after tax as early as possible at the beginning of the year with the following formula:

After tax contribution = 58,000-19,500-employer contribution (which is 2k)

Can I do the below at the new employer?

Our parents persuaded us to do 15 years to pay it off quick. Their reasoning was while 30 years is the ideal outcome for investing more into the stock market they also said it's better for peace of mind to have a ""paid"" off house then have something latched on to you for another 15 years. They said the stock market isn't also so great all the time and our retirement is already decent to keep putting even more in than needed.

jzh9v8,HastroX,"Why do people always say buy the smallest house in the best neighborhood?

For example in NJ, buying the smallest house in the best neighborhood usually means in a rich neighborhood. Basically in NJ at the same price points you can have a large mansion in the ghetto/lower income area, average house in the average place or a tiny house (or even just a townhouse/condo) in a rich neighborhood.

I understand buying a large mansion in the bad neighborhood isn't worth it due to crime, safety risks, no healthy food options, no infrastructure/ local government funding, bad schools etc. At the same time though buying in a rich neighborhood also has its flaws too. Essentially everything around you is at a premium. All expensive food shopping around you (4$ for an apple where in another area sell for 1$), expensive retails and even upcharged services you just because they think your rich. You also pay more property taxes (at least in NJ) due to the great schools. The smallest house probably may become so limited in aspects. I've seen kitchens with barely any space that they need a portable cart to put stuff on or rooms so small you can only fit one twin bed. Seems like the quality of life suffers base on these factors.

So I guess my question is, why do people not just buy the house in they income range they can afford?  From a logic perspective, I don't even begin to decide how much house I can afford without ensuring emergency fund, maxing my 401k and IRA first and even having extra savings to ensure when you buy a house it's not sparsely ""empty"" or filled with ""cheap"" stuff that you have to replace every year.

Thinking about all I have to do before buying a house makes me feel how much of a risk do people really tackle on? My parents former house owner brought a home and took out a 500K+ jumbo loan and an extra 60K+ loan somewhere and only downpaid barely 10% for their 3400 sq. mcmansion.

Dilemma:

My wife and I live in ""average"" township. Schools are 5/10 basically. Houses ranges from low incoming housing (150K-250K) to middle (300K to 500K$) to a bit higher (500K-700K$). We have a lot of fast food options i.e. McDonalds, Burger King, etc. and cheaper supermarkets like Aldi, Target, Walmart, etc. It's basically a ""convivence"" township. Our township  also surrounds a donut township that's even lower income but go to the same school as our town. The good news is more asians (indians in particular) are flowing to our township so the demographic might help the school scores in the future.

Our next door township is an above average township. Townhouses range from 450K to 600K and Single Family Homes go from 600K to 1.5M$. Schools are extremely good, 8 or 9 out of 10. They have better options in terms of food supermarkets i.e. Trader Joes, Wegmans, Costco, Whole Foods, etc. and shopping. By far this township is for people who are well to do.

We find ourselves going to the next door township (15-20mins every time) often for food, retail shopping, outdoor parks, etc. and just ""occasionally"" going to our town for emergencies only. This causes to re-think our home purchase.

No matter how much I go up to the corporate ladder there's no way we can afford those 800K-1M$ houses today because by that time it'll probably be 2M$ in the future even with promotions, raises, etc. So it seems going up the ladder is semi-pointless in a sense.

Then there's the risk of starting up a business like a restaurant,  creating/inventing something a product  and I'd rather not being a situation where I need to take out a second mortgage or withdraw from my 401K. I could in a sense invest in individual stocks but that's probably more gamble than ""strategy"".  The other choice is find a second part time job but at that point seems like I'm trading time for half the money I make at work.

 However, Iâ€™m a bit confused as to exactly what an automatic pay credit is and how that differs from the regular 401K matching.

Here is the wording from the plan docs:

Company contributions:

Automatic pay credits:

After one year of total service, employees are eligible for automatic pay credits equal to 3% of Eligible Compensation (base salary/ regular pay and annual and non-annual cash incentives, capped at $100,000 annually). You don't need to take any action to receive the pay credits. Pay credits will be invested according to your investment elections on file for all future contributions to the Plan. Automatic pay credits are equal to 3% to 5% of Eligible Compensation (capped at $100,000 annually) based on years of pay credit service as of December 31 of the applicable plan year.

Matching contributions:

 (Company) matches your contributions, dollar for dollar, up to 5% of Eligible Compensation you contribute to the Plan once you complete one year of total service.

Remember you need to contribute 5% of your Eligible Compensation for the year to maximize the matching contribution (the company) provides.

Based on this, is my plan saying if I put in at least 5% I get an (3%+5% =8% match?) orâ€¦. Is it only one that I get to pick?",Yes,Yes,No,No,No
qfju9j,HeavySigh14,"Father has $0 saved for retirement and heâ€™s getting sick at 62.

My father is 62 and he has $0 saved for retirement. He can no longer work, as he has diabetes and recently got a foot infection. His leg may have to be amputated. 

He currently lives in a section 8 style apartment with subsidized rent with his significant other. They have hit rough times, and he may have to leave their home in South Florida. His income has been 0 for the last two years, so he wouldnâ€™t qualify for any other place even if he tried.

He says he wouldnâ€™t qualify for Social Security. He was an accountant by trade, so Iâ€™m inclined to believe him on this. He immigrated to America as a young adult, so I do not know if that means he overstayed his Visa, or if heâ€™s here illegally, or if that is just the law.

I am so lost on what I should do. I make 30k a year and live several hundred miles away from him. Whenever I have extra money I send it to him, but thatâ€™s just not enough. 

I may be wrong, but from what I understand he was here legally for some time. He was a registered accountant and a registered realtor, which seems like things he couldnâ€™t do if he was here illegally? 

But now that I think about it, he told me once that he got let go recently (3-5 years ago) from one of his jobs because he kept giving the company an incorrect SSN. Which makes me lean towards expired Visa. I am not knowledgeable in Immigration law, so i could be completely wrongâ€¦

Do you guys have any recommendations? Iâ€™d love to hear it.

On December 28th, 2021 I put my first $10 into a ROTH IRA on Fidelity to figure out how to start investing, before I set up my job's 401K plan. 

The fund's invested in FZROX (FIDELITY ZERO TOTAL MARKET INDEX) which is basically just the S&amp;P 500

As of right now the fund is at $8.95. (Down 10%) I have been keeping up with the stock market and I know it's bouncing up and down right now. But I figured yesterday, the stocks closed higher than the day before so I should have at least gained some of the money back right? 

My fund has only ever lost money, I have not gained a single penny. I'm not sure I am doing this right. 

Also, I set my job's 401k up and have about $300 invested in Fidelity's BTC LP IDX 2065 M (Down 7%) which is a Target Date Fund. I was doing some extra research and people called it a bad buy. So I diversified a little bit:

t5wm4e,HeavySigh14,"Need some help figuring out what my next moves should be?

 Background: Hello, I am 22. I recently started a new job where I make 40k a year. I am a current Computer Science college student and I expect to graduate within 1 year. I also plan to do grad-school part-time after. 

For my immediate goals, I would like to start saving for a house (30k minimum), I want to start saving for Grad school, while also paying off all of my debt.

Breakdown:

**Take Home: $3,000 monthly (After Taxes)**

**Rent/Utilities**: $900 monthly

**Personal Bills**: $250 monthly

**Groceries**: $250

**Roth IRA**: $500 month/6k year (15%)

**Savings:** $265 month (750 total)

**529**: $40 monthly (I don't have kids yet, but I want one)

I don't have a car, but I would like to buy one soon (Insurance + Car payment = $500 month)

**Student Loans**: $6,000 total by the time I graduate (All subsidized) 

I'm eligible to participate in my job's 401k soon and have a match of 4%.

With my tax return, I also cleared out most of my credit card debt. I only have around $1500 left.

Anyway, I'm not sure what my next steps should be. I **desperately** want to own my own home within the next 3 years. My undergrad degree is free for the most part because of my scholarships and pell grants, but the Master's will cost me between $10,000 and $15,000. 

My current employer will not cover any cost of the Graduate degree, but it is likely that I will find a new employer anyway after I graduate soon.

I'm still relatively young and I have a bit of time, So I'm considering cutting my retirement down to only the 4% employer match and shoveling money into a saving's account for a home down payment. 

But, I also know saving for retirement is important, and starting earlier is better for compounding.        + my contributions won't even be vested with the employer match if I leave soon.

After I graduate, I do expect my income to go up to **at least** $50,000, and my master's should bring me to **at least** $70,000 yearly. (With a degree in Computer Science I suspect I can make a lot more). 

I'm not really sure what to prioritize right now. My Master's degree will increase my income and job opportunities. A house will start appreciating in value (especially if i get a fixer-upper. (My partner and his family are all licensed tradesman, so they'll do some of our work for cheap). Or, should I funnel money into my retirement so that I can FIRE, or retire early, and enjoy my life?

What do you guys think?",Yes,Yes,No,Yes,Yes
t9sz07,HeavySigh14,"Confused with jobâ€™s â€œSafe-Harbor 401k planâ€?

The documentation states: 

â€œThe safe harbor matching centribution will be a 100% matching contribution on all Salary Deferrals you make to the Plan up to 4% of compensation. Thy safe harbor matching contribution is based on Salary Deferrals you make during each payroll period during the Plan Year.â€

Then further down it says: 

you are eligible to make Salary Deferrals into the Plan, you also are eligible for the safe harbor contribution. Any matching contributions under this formula will only apply to contributions you make to the Plan up to 6% of compensation. Thus, you will not receive any additional matching contributions on contributions you make to the Plan above 6% of compensation. 

In no case will you receive a total matching
contribution in excess of 4% of compensation. 

â€œYou are always 100% vested in the safe harbor contribution and any Salary Deferrals you make to the Plan.â€ 

Discretionary matching contribution. We have the discretion to make a matching contribution for eligible participants who contribute to the Plan. We will decide each year how much (if any) we will contribute as an additional matching contribution. Any matching contributions under this formula will only apply to contributions you make to the Plan up to 6% of compensation. Thus, you will not receive any additional matching contributions on contributions you make to the Plan above 6% of compensation. 

In no case will you receive a total matching
contribution in excess of 4% of compensation.

After this section, the company lists out a 6 year vesting schedule.

Iâ€™m pretty confused on how this works. Does the company match 4% or 6%? How am I 100% vested immediately, but then have a 6 year vesting schedule?

So Safe Harbor contributions are 100% my own contributions, and none of the employers?",Yes,Yes,No,No,Yes

So I had a $1600 collection on my report from my old apartment complex. Both my boyfriend and I were on the lease.

They responded by saying that they were sorry, and could not verify the debt and will remove the collection from my record in 30-45 day. They have already removed it from my Experian Report but not my other two.

Anyway, nothing has been removed from my partnerâ€™s credit report. Would they take it off of his as well automatically?

v37h11,HeavySigh14,"Can I afford to buy my mother's house?

My mom want's to sell me her townhome below market value, but I'm not 100% sure if this is a good idea. She owns the home free and clear (No Mortgage) and has already brought a second house to live in

She wants to sell the home to me for between $225,000 to $250,000. This is A 3/2 townhome in the Tampa area. A comparable unit in her neighborhood just sold for $275,000, however my mother's house is on the water which may make her price go higher.

I am a full-time 23 y/o Computer Science college student (will graduate in 6 months), with a full-time tech job making $40,000 a year. Or around $3,000 a month. For my expenses I pay :

\- $1000 month for Rent/Utilities (My half)

\- $400-500 Miscellaneous/Fun 

\- I have no savings right now

\- I have $8500 in Federal student loans that are deferred until 2024. For a 10 year plan I pay $150/mon

\- Credit Score 680's

The rest is either used to pay-off debt or put in my Roth Ira.

I have been doing some research and the mortgage (assuming 250k) would run me $1900-ish a month, including HOA fees, property taxes (she would transfer her homestead exemption to me), Homeowners Insurance, and some utilities. Also, how does a gift of equity work? Would the home price be $300,000 and the equity gift be $50,000 bringing the price to 250k? The research online is a little confusing. 

The home has:

\- 3 year old new roof

\- 3 year old new HVAC system

\- 3 year old new appliances

\- 5 year old flooring

\- Recently had an inspection (less than 1 year ago) in which there were only minor problems

\- Would come partially furnished 

I currently live with my boyfriend of 3 years, I of course would not put him on the mortgage or anything official, but he would be my roommate and is willing to pay $1000 month for expenses/rent. I also have a friend who would be interested in renting one of the rooms out for $500. I could also rent the 3rd bedroom out for extra income, but I'm not sure on that yet.

My mother (who is a realtor) said she would pay $10,000 for my down payment and cover closing cost. She would also waive realtor fees, although I know we can go through an attorney instead to lower prices as well.

I'm really hung up on this decision. I know this is a great deal but the monthly payment is daunting. 

Although, I am a bit comforted that my income will increase after I graduate to at least $55,000.

My mom also floated the idea of her taking out a $200k HELOC, and then me moving in and paying it off?",Yes,Yes,No,Yes,Yes

10965oz,helpdesk-26,"Would it make sense for my MIL to go on IBR for Parent Plus loans?

Hey all. So a little context here first. 

My fiancÃ©e and I met in college. After college we moved away to get away from her physically and financially abusive mother. Her mother is awful with money and has a big â€œcredit cards are free moneyâ€ complex that keeps them poor. 

So her mom took out 160k of parent plus loans (in addition to the 25k in my fiancÃ©es name that weâ€™ve paid off) This was never discussed and my fiancÃ©e was just told â€œitâ€™s being taken care ofâ€. She was too lazy to fill out the FAFSA and instead took out loans for the entire balance. She then sprung it on us that weâ€™d be expected to pay 1/2 of the loans upon graduation. I believe the monthly payment as of now is around $1000. 

Weâ€™re saving for a house, so we cannot really afford to be throwing away that much each month. (Like wanting to buy one within the next year. Weâ€™ve been living with my parents to save for going on 3 years) My other concern is her mother is known for making dumb financial choices to pay for things she doesnâ€™t need. (Constant balance transfers. Multiple home equity loans). Iâ€™m concerned these loans were partially used to subsidize her spending and not fully used for school. Is there any way to confirm this ? 

The incomes we are working with are: 

Her Parents : About 60k a year 
Us: About 140k a year 

If it were up to me, Iâ€™d let them drown. It was their mistake and was never agreed to throughout school. However, my fiancÃ©e is worried that if we do that theyâ€™ll take it out on her sister who still lives with them. 

From what I can see, Parent Plus loans are eligible for IBR repayment plans which caps it at like 10% of discretionary income. Because itâ€™s based on their income and not ours, Iâ€™d assume the payment would be pretty low. Since their income is so much lower than ours, do you think this is the best plan going forward ?

Hello there. My girlfriend and I both graduated college last year and Iâ€™m coming up on a year at my first â€œrealâ€ job in January. We both live with my parents rent free and they told us we can stay as long as we like. Our goal is to use this time to pay down our student loans aggressively so we can eventually get married and buy a home. 

This is more about my budget. Gross I make about $3500 a month. My monthly budget looks like this: 

$500 - Car and Insurance 

$1000 - Student Loan Payment
 
$200 - Roth 

$300- Savings
 
$150 - â€œfunâ€ spending money
 
$70 - Gas 

$20 - Cellphone
 
$5 - Apple Music 

I try to keep my spending incredibly low so I can throw as much money at my loans as I can. Most months, I spend far less than my â€œspendâ€ allotment and just end up throwing it into my savings account. 

In terms of my assets I have: 

Around 10K in savings. 

Around 5k in checking. 

10k in my Roth 

15k in savings bonds. 

As soon as the 0% for federal loans expires, Iâ€™m going to make a lump sum payment on my loans for the entire 15k. 

I have about 60k worth of loans. They are federal and currently at the 0% rate. My girlfriend and I have the goal to have our loans cleaned up within 4 years so we can then start saving for a house. My parents said we can stay as long as we like. It really isnâ€™t bad since we have our own level of the house with a kitchen, bedroom, and bathroom. Is it bad to stay this long if they allow it? It feels like a great opportunity to pay off loans and save money. 

How does my budget look? My only weak spot I believe is my car and insurance. Iâ€™m 23 so insurance is very expensive. Public transit isnâ€™t an option for me so I need to drive to work. 

Granted, Iâ€™d love to improve my income. Iâ€™m not sure if 42k is considered â€œgoodâ€ for a first job out of college. Iâ€™m thinking about getting more schooling for free through my company. They will reimburse tuition in exchange for 2 year contract. Iâ€™m considering on getting an MBA part time since itâ€™s free. Does that sound like a good way to boost my income? I like the company so I have no issues with staying for a while. Iâ€™m lucky because I have an interest in finance / business and was able to find an entry level job in it even though my degree is Political Science (yeah I regret that a ton). 

I work for an OEM so the car was bought with employee discounts. The discount made it cheap enough where it will never be underwater. When Iâ€™m ready to move out, my plan is to sell it and dump any positive equity in my loans. 

Are there any other surefire ways to boost my income in the future? Combined my girlfriend and I make about 110k so Iâ€™m hoping thatâ€™s enough to live comfortably enough until we can boost our incomes. Please let me know if you have any questions or need clarification. Thank you!",Yes,Yes,No,Yes,No

I have about 60k worth of loans. They are federal and currently at the 0% rate. My girlfriend and I have the goal to have our loans cleaned up within 4 years so we can then start saving for a house. My parents said we can stay as long as we like. It really isnâ€™t bad since we have our own level of the house with a kitchen, bedroom, and bathroom. Is it bad to stay this long if they allow it? It feels like a great opportunity to pay off loans and save money. 

How does my budget look? My only weak spot I believe is my car and insurance. Iâ€™m 23 so insurance is very expensive. Public transit isnâ€™t an option for me so I need to drive to work. 

Granted, Iâ€™d love to improve my income. Iâ€™m not sure if 42k is considered â€œgoodâ€ for a first job out of college. Iâ€™m thinking about getting more schooling for free through my company. They will reimburse tuition in exchange for 2 year contract. Iâ€™m considering on getting an MBA part time since itâ€™s free. Does that sound like a good way to boost my income? I like the company so I have no issues with staying for a while. Iâ€™m lucky because I have an interest in finance / business and was able to find an entry level job in it even though my degree is Political Science (yeah I regret that a ton). 

I work for an OEM so the car was bought with employee discounts. The discount made it cheap enough where it will never be underwater. When Iâ€™m ready to move out, my plan is to sell it and dump any positive equity in my loans. 

Are there any other surefire ways to boost my income in the future? Combined my girlfriend and I make about 110k so Iâ€™m hoping thatâ€™s enough to live comfortably enough until we can boost our incomes. Please let me know if you have any questions or need clarification. Thank you!",Yes,Yes,No,Yes,No

Hello there. Iâ€™m eligible for the Ford employee discount. I can get a 45,000 Lincoln for $250 a month OTD for 36 months with $0 down.

Hello. Iâ€™m trying to weigh my options and make sure I make the correct decisions for long term financial stability and wealth. 

Iâ€™m 24 and started my first job out of school a year ago next week. My salary for 2019 was around $43,000 with bonuses. Iâ€™m not really sure if thatâ€™s a good amount or not. I live in a rust belt city if that helps. 

I was kind of expecting to make more when I entered college since my original plan was law school. I decided that wasnâ€™t worth it. 

My current position is in the credit department of a chemical company (I got lucky). Iâ€™ve been told Iâ€™m doing great and am already #2 in terms of performance on the team of 10. Iâ€™m starting to plan my next move and wanted some advice on that. 

My current ideas: 

1.	Get more schooling on the companies dime and stay long term hoping for raises and advancements. The company claims they like to hire from within for positions in complete different departments. This seems to be true. This could also make me more marketable to other employers. The only downside is a two year contract upon completion.

mw3bff,helpdesk-26,"Asking for some guidance for my girlfriend after her mom messed up.

Hello everyone. Trying to make some long terms plans here but my girlfriend is in a bit of a pickle. So her mom was lazy and didnâ€™t fill out the FAFSA for college and instead took out most of her college tuition in parent plus loans. 

Yesterday she called us asking if we would take out loans in our name so she could pay off the plus loans. We refused. I guess the original agreement was for her and her parents to both pay about $600 a month towards them? In total there are about 140k worth of loans at anywhere from 6-7% interest. 

My girlfriend was sobbing last night after being told that number. Her mom never told her just how much the loans were and instead repeatedly told her â€œIâ€™m taking care of it donâ€™t worryâ€. She is now terrified that her life is ruined by this debt and that sheâ€™ll never be able to afford a house or to get married. She is livid with her mom and not speaking to her. I understand she has no actual responsibility for these loans, but sheâ€™s afraid of retribution towards her sister if she just cuts them off. 

She makes 55k as an RN. Last night, I did some quick math and it looks like if she picks up 2-3 extra shifts a month, thatâ€™ll give her about 1k extra a month to throw at these loans. Her only expenses are her car + insurance ($300 a month) and rent + utilities ($350 a month). Sheâ€™s contributing her full company match to her 403B and is contributing to a Roth. (Her mom said I was stupid for advocating for retirement savings). The rest has been going into savings while the loans are paused and a big payment will be made right before the interest starts again later this year. I believe she has about 20k in savings total. 

Realistically, how badly does this delay us from advancing in our lives? (We make about 100k-115k combined at 24)How quickly do you think we can get this debt taken care of? I know not to help her make payments if we arenâ€™t married.

Hey all. Trying to figure out what we should do with our housing situation. 

The facts: 

1.	We currently live with my parents for free 
2.	Iâ€™ve accepted a new fully remote job that will allow me to work from anywhere 
3.	We are thinking we want to move back to a higher COL area (where we went to college)
4.	Combined we bring in about 130k a year 
5.	We have about 75k in total savings 
6.	She has significant student loan debt (60k or so) 
7.	I have much less student loan debt that Iâ€™m going to pay off as soon as deferment ends (25k) 
8.	Our only real expenses are our cars / gas / insurance which is about $800 a month 

Part of me is leaning toward renting just so we have some time to make sure we really want to live in the area and wonâ€™t move back a year later. We have visited extensively since leaving and have a good idea of the area weâ€™d like. I also am worried about the increasing cost of rent and like the idea of capping monthly payments with a mortgage. 

A townhouse / condo seems like it may not be a bad idea to buy. We have no plans of kids, donâ€™t need a ton of space, they tend to be in prime locations that we couldnâ€™t afford a stand alone home in, and theyâ€™re significantly cheaper. 

What do you think is our best move here?",Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes,No

133ui7g,Highwayman1717,"Windfall of 3K: Statistical best way to use it?

I have a $3,000 bonus that fell out of the sky. I follow this sub's flow chart religiously, and have checked off most of boxes on the way to now. Before the usual recommendations come in, I've already...

\-Paid off all debt except my 3% mortgage and 2.9% car loan. There's 12K left on the car, but I'm only paying 309 a month with 27 going to interest, not worth paying ahead. 

\-Saved up enough to be budgeting a month ahead, best choice I ever made. 

\-Six month emergency fund is done. 

\-20% of income is going to retirement.

\-Roth is maxed out with monthly payments. 

This rules out most basic choices. Even a HYSA will pay off more than shaving a year off the car loan. I don't do big vacations, my hobbies are self-funded by sidehustles. What next?",No,Yes,No,No,No
138q019,Highwayman1717,"Eventual costs: When to budget aside, when to plunk it down all at once?

Time and time again, I find myself squinting at the decision of when to use extra money on-hand to pay off an eventual cost and when to slot it down into my monthly budget. For example...I just changed jobs, I now contribute to my IRA differently. I'm putting aside 550 a month to settle into that permanent habit, but the end of this year I'll be 228 short of maxing it. I have some bonus cash sitting around waiting to be budgeted. I could plunk it down and 'save' 38 dollars a month in budgeting. But there's no pending need to, no interest, why not just pay the 38 a month aside and use that initial capital on something else? 

&#x200B;

It's so petty a decision that I keep flip-flopping. Am I winning  38 a  month on something fun because I was responsible with a windfall, or wasting a bigger amount on something that doesn't need to be paid off? What's your personal decision tree on this?",Yes,Yes,No,Yes,Yes

14a5pmx,Highwayman1717,"5K Windfall, no clear options for it. Ideas?

To start: I follow the flow chart on this sub religiously, it's amazing, well aware of it. 

I just finished up juggling two full-time jobs as I transitioned from one company to another, ending up with about 5-6K surplus. I need a new fridge and a trailer hitch for my car, so there goes 1K on reasonable costs on something I need that will lower my electric bill and let me enjoy a hobby more. From there, there is no end in sight for where the money 'should go'...

&#x200B;

Emergency fund: Already have 10K on-hand liquid. Also have 8K in a Fidelity HSA which can be tapped into for medical emergencies. 

&#x200B;

Retirement: I'm already saving 20%, maxing out my Roth, and meeting my 401k match with extra to hit a round 20%. I'm already contributing $1400 a month to those accounts, this surplus wouldn't be that dramatic even if I somehow sent it all to my 401K. 

&#x200B;

Debt: No debt except a 2% car loan and a 3% mortgage, paying either down would lose money due to the low interest rates. 

&#x200B;

Lifestyle: I live frugally and everything is already budgeted for exactly including travel, hobbies, even my Renn Faire season pass is budgeted for monthly. 

&#x200B;

It's not enough to buy into a business or create any new income, but too much to just spend on Funko Pops. I want this money to 'make more money' or reduce anxiety to improve my life. Ideas?",Yes,Yes,No,No,Yes

Hi everyone, I'm still pretty new to personal finance and investing and could use some advice. Background on me, I'm a 27yo single dude in Santa Barbara, CA. I have a BS from UCSB and am currently making $64k/yr. Possibly getting a promotion or new job soon. My only debt is a car, which I have a $7800 loan at 6.99% on, although I have enough to pay it off, I just kinda want to hold the loan to hold cash and build credit. My expenses are relatively low, with my biggest main expense being rent at $810/mo. My risk tolerance is pretty big given my age. I'd like to be saving up for retirement as well as a house.

For the past six months or so, I have been auto-investing into the Schwab 2060 target date fund (SWYNX) with $500/mo going into my Roth IRA, and $420/mo going into my individual brokerage acct.

I am somewhat considering starting a robot advisor, either Schwab Intelligent Portfolio or SoFi, as both of these have $0 management fees. Schwab IP holds a good amount of its allocation in cash though, which is irritating. However, Schwab IP does do tax loss harvesting while SoFi doesn't.

ewhvv5,HistoryTeacher112940,"Which of my 457b choices is best option? Or should I go the taxable brokerage route?

Hello everyone. 34 years old. 11th year teacher (3rd in California).

Last week, my Payroll &amp; Benefits director let me know that our district would now be offering CalSTRS Pension 2 457 (Roth option also) to our certificated staff. I realize this is not as sexy as having Fidelity, Vanguard, etc. as direct vendors, but the fees are considerably lower than our other options in the 457.

Current 457 Plan Options:
AIG Retirement Services (VALIC), AXA Equitable Life Insurance Company, National Life Group, Pacific Life, PlanMember Services, CalSTRS Pension 2 (VOYA), CalPERS 457 (VOYA)

The two lowest fee plans for 457â€™s are CalSTRS and CalPERS. Every other plan is above 0.7%, even for passive index funds, after administration fees.

Ex: CalSTRS Pension 2 457â€™s lowest fee option: Vanguard Total Stock Market Index at 0.27% Fee (0.02 Vanguard + 0.25% CalSTRS) -VS- CalPERS 457â€™s lowest fee option: State Street Russell All Cap Index Fund at 0.41% Fee.

If chosen: I would be maxing the $19,500 in the 457 account throughout the remaining 10 pay periods of 2020.

My two questions for our experienced group members here:

1) Would a 0.27-0.30% fee cause you to forget the 457 option and instead move to focusing on a taxable brokerage account?

2) Does anyone have any recommendations on my other 457 plan options? From my research, CalSTRS Pension 2 is looking like the best option of the group.

exvsm5,HistoryTeacher112940,"Good strategy for my previous employerâ€™s Roth 457?

I have $122k with my previous employerâ€™s Roth 457 account.

I have just opened up a Roth 457 with my current school district in California: CalSTRS Pension 2.

Does this plan make sense:

Allow my 1,950 (February paycheck)  to deposit into the Roth 457 account with CalSTRS Pension 2. Afterwards, change my contributions to traditional 457 for the remaining 9 pay periods of 2020? 

I would allow this 1,950 to hit my Roth 457 to establish an account, afterwards I would roll my $122k from my old employerâ€™s Roth 457 into the new account with Pension 2? 

CalSTRS Pension 2 fund fees are 0.27-0.30% for the funds I want to invest in. My previous employerâ€™s plan was greater than 0.7%. I did not want to roll into a Roth IRA, because Iâ€™d lose the 457 benefits.

My Thinking: 
1) Lower fees in my current employerâ€™s plan
2) Not having multiple accounts for 457 to juggle
3) Allows me to keep the benefits of a 457 rather than rolling the $122k into a Roth IRA.

Big Question: Does this plan make strategic sense? I would just keep my 457 a traditional account moving forward in my career, and allow the $122k to accrue on its own in the Roth 457.

**Property:**

* Home is paid off.
* Four (4) unit rental property has $615k left on mortgage - $1.2 million property
   * This property is a significant portion of my wife's retirement plan (which I know, is ""our"" plan). Property was bought two years prior to our meeting each other.

**Retirement:**

* 2020: I am maxing out my Roth IRA at the beginning of each year. Maxing out my 457b and 403b through the year (DCA). Wife maxes out here Roth IRA throughout the year.

**Place the following into a high interest savings account (Ally or Capital One 360):**

* $42,000 - Taxable brokerage account (spread it out over the next 12 months) - since I am maxing out my tax-advantaged accounts (IRA, 403, 457), this is probably the next route to go for investing. This is 31% of my current savings, being invested. Comfortable with this being spread over multiple months.
* $25,000 - Next car fund - when my current 2010 car bites the dust (currently 92k miles)
* $25,000 - Emergency fund
* $10,000 - Fun fund with family/personal
* $7,500   - Personal contribution to Sonâ€™s 529 plan and/or savings account

**Place the following into my Bank of America account:**

* $17,000 - checking/savings - for easy access when needed (bills)

**Question #2:**  In our Joint Account, we have about $126k. Does the following make decent sense to move forward with our joint money?

**Place the following into a high interest savings account (Ally or Capital One 360):**

* $30,000 - Rental Property Maintenance - repairs and upkeep on rental
* $23,000 - Kid Expenses - swim classes, babysitter, clothes, food, etc.
* $18,000 - Emergency Fund
* $15,000 - Second Sonâ€™s 529 Fund (coming in June)
* $15,000 - Primary Home Maintenance

Last night, my wifeâ€™s father called to inform us to check our sonâ€™s email inbox (set it up for family to write to him, and have him open it up later in life).

In the email it stated that my father- and mother-in-law would be giving our son a birthday gift of $1,000 x his age (Ex: 4th birthday = $4,000) up to his 18th birthday. This would total $171,000.

They asked that it be spent on funding school/college, living expenses during school, etc. Obviously, we will abide by these wishes.

My wife and I had already set up a 529 account for our son. We have invested $7,000, thus far, and have another $8,000 to DCA. However, with this change of funds, it has made me want to rethink the allocation.

Overfunding, doesnâ€™t need as much as what we think are things we are also considering.

**Options thought of:**

***1a) Continue to fund the 529 account with each birthday?***

***1b) Invest 50% into a 529 account and 50% into a CD laddering plan each year?***

***1c) Invest into a 529 his 1st - 14th birthday money (105k), and place his 15th - 18th (66k) into a CD ladder? (or some type of similar amount of years on either side)***

***2) Invest some money into a UTMA?***

***3) We never talked about this before, but this could give some flexibility to fund private school in high school. Just keeping on radar as a possibility now***

In a bit of an interesting investment situation- while working and attending community college the past year, I was able to max my Roth plus another \~$10k in savings (cash). Given that I have transferred to a 4-year school and am no longer working, I am not expecting to earn enough income from internships next year to max my ira again (aka leftover after expenses). This begs the question- with the $10k on hand, should I A) contribute to a brokerage, B) wait until next year to contribute to the Roth, or C) do a mix/move money from one to the other?

Wife and I decided to renew a lease on an ok but cheaper apartment until July 2024. Weâ€™ve been saving for a house in Denver which is expensive. Weâ€™re easily able to afford the apartment and currently saving/investing $1,500 a week, and not opposed to staying longer though itâ€™s a dream to own a larger home. 

My question is, given the stock market is down and could even fall further, and given interest rates are rising how should we invest/save the extra income we have if weâ€™re flexible on moving? We are debt free. 

Is it better in an economy like this to invest the bare minimum for retirement like 10-15% of our income and save the rest or since the market is down itâ€™s wise to invest more? We have about 10% saved for a down payment.

My expenses are pretty low since my car is paid off and I currently live with a friend for cheap. All said Iâ€™m saving about $2,500 a month on top of maxing my Roth and HSA which I already maxed for this year. (Iâ€™m not offered a 401k at my job). 

Iâ€™ve been wanting to buy a house for over a year but covid affected my job to where I couldnâ€™t get approved for a loan.

I'm looking to buy my first home in Denver, which has seen prices skyrocket the past year and decade.  I'm living with my fiance who will help with the mortgage, and am approved up to $500k. I am looking at roughly a 4.315% rate, which really limits what I'm able to buy.  I want to view my house as much as an investment as I can.  I am basically looking at either going cheap with a 1 bedroom condo, or paying a lot more and getting a 2 bed townhome or SFH.

Just to note, I have no debt, I have roughly 5-10% saved for a down payment, and really good credit. I want to view my home as much as an investment as I can.

So my question is, given how hot and competitive the market is, and given how all my investments are in the stock market, what is considered the better investment? Buying a 1 bed condo and having my mortgage payment be closer to 25% post tax, or buying a townhome/single family home and have my monthly payment be closer to 28% my gross income? Getting a 1 bed would allow me to aggressively pay off the mortgage while also investing in index funds.

Iâ€™m a first time homebuyer. Iâ€™ve been preapproved around 4.3% for a new build and i will lock in in 2-4 mo. Move in will be 5-7 months after that when my down payment will be due.  I currently have $25k saved for a $440k house. I can sell roughly another $20k in index funds in my taxable account but donâ€™t really want to as markets are down. I have a 4 month emergency fund saved, 800+ credit score.

My question is. Over these next months as I prepare to close and give my down payment on the house, how should I allocate my savings to my retirement funds and the down payment on the house? Since I am a little behind on saving for retirement should I still be maxing out my accounts? I donâ€™t have a 401k but have a Roth IRA and HSA.

Live in a very hot housing market. Having lots of trouble buying as my approval amount is below the median home price and Iâ€™m a first time home buyer with less than 10% saved.

A nice townhome in an area I would love to live in just became available and me and my broker are pushing hard for it. The kicker is i would buy the house this weekend (weâ€™re already drafting out offer), and then have a tenantuntil Sept 1. The tenant is paying $70 less than what my monthly costs would be after closing. 

I understand this creates a lot of risk with the tenant but the home is listed under market value and I know this tenant situation will scare a lot of people away and give me a better chance to get the house, and I have to be flexible to get a home of this quality in this market.

1) Is this even a good idea or is it too risky to consider? 
2) What sort of things can I do to ensure the tenant is reliable and wonâ€™t screw me by trashing the place or squatting or something? (Theyâ€™re paying a lot to rent the place, and their stuff is nice so I donâ€™t think theyâ€™re trashy people)

After 2 years living with friends and saving 5-10% for a house down payment in a hot market (Denver) I decided in December to try and buy. I havenâ€™t gotten close to having an offer accepted and prices and interest rates keep going up that financially Iâ€™m just wondering should I give up completely or rent for a year and try again.

If I do buy anything itâ€™ll be a cheaper starter townhome/condo. Iâ€™ll be living with my fiancÃ© and after putting $30-$40k down. Iâ€™m hoping to have monthly expenses on the home at $2,600 or less.

Or we can live in a 2 bed with her current roommate and his boyfriend which would be a little cramped, but weâ€™d only be paying about $400 each and weâ€™d be saving a ton of money.

Our situation is we have about $40k saved for a down payment. In our budget weâ€™re looking at places priced $350-$450k. So roughly 5% down. As I understand the program they make their money when we sell and they take a cut of the appreciation of the house. Weâ€™re having trouble competing on offers and are thinking of doing this so we can better afford a home and compete better on offers. 

My question is, is a program like this worth it? Clear downside is we lose out on appreciation of any home and weâ€™ll eventually have to pay back their â€œloan.â€   But perks seem to be we wonâ€™t have mortgage insurance payments, our monthly payments on the house are lower, we donâ€™t pay have to pay the bank roughly 5% interest on the Landed loan amount (roughly $50-$80k) bc our mortgage is lower, and it gives us more purchasing power and flexibility to buy in this tough market.

My fiancÃ© and I are saving for a first time home in a HCOL area. Our target time to buy is late 2023 into 2024.

She has about $19k in federal student loans and she received a pell grant so  if the student loan forgiveness passes she should get all her debt forgiven. Knowing this is a possibility and that weâ€™re trying to save about $75k more over the next year, how should she go about dealing with the debt? Make the payments? Save a bunch in a HYSA and then Pay it off if it doesnâ€™t pass? Other options? 

Secondly. I have about $40k down payment fund in a HYSA making 3%. Considering Iâ€™m looking at 12-18 month before I buy is that the best place to keep the money or should I be looking into things like treasury bills or other options as I continue to add to the fund.

WEALTHFRONT RETURN ON INVESTMENT

The return on investment Wealthfront is showing me does not add up. 

I contribute 100 dollars weekly since 2018. My risk score is 7. So Iâ€™m diversified between us stocks international stocks and  bonds etc. 

My time weighted return says 10.6% All Time 
And my money weighted return says 6% All Time 

This is my all time returns not ytd or specific year. 

My contributions is 15,300 and my account value is 15,788. My all time dividends reinvested was 592 dollars. 

With the stock market back up to wear it is almost. Why is my return only 488 dollars? Even when I have 592 dollars in dividends? And how is 488 even 6% or 10% return like it says?? Iâ€™m actually losing money technically if it wasnâ€™t for my 592 in dividends keeping me afloat by 488 dollars. I look at my individual allocations and they are all up and one or 2 asset classes down slightly like -2% rest are up for lifetime view. 

Can some explain? Does this dollar cost averaging weekly have something to do with it? I thought DCA is the best way to invest since you canâ€™t time? Why am I still not up like it says 10% but 10% what be 1500 dollars not 488.",No,Yes,No,No,Yes

Hey everybody right now I am concerned about health insurance and Medicaid in NY, and very unsure what will happen. 

I lost my job in 2020 and applied for Medicaid starting Jan 2021. 

Mid Jan 2021 I got hired for a good job, but I am
Not â€œeligibleâ€ for their health insurance until Mid April 2021. The health insurance here is horrible, and I am worried I will be facing penalties, or a huge bill at some point if I stay on Medicaid and opt out of their crappy health insurance. Their health ins is a $6000 deductible, and will cost a lot for any doc visit or procedure. I basically will never reach this and will be paying out of pocket a lot for routine stuff at an urgent care or PC. 

Does anybody have any insight on what to do? I am worried that if I report my new income my Medicaid benefits would come to and end, and I would be forced on this bad plan. 

From what I read online so far is that Medicaid will last a year. Is this still true?",No,Yes,No,Yes,Yes

As of today Best Buy Balance $4,148. Paid off Jan 2022. Will be paying $800 a month starting this month

I have maxed out my IRA right now for 2021.

&amp;#x200B;

My options for this new money are the below

Invest it into ETFs, mutual funds, stocks, etc...

Invest it into cryptos

Build up the emergency fund so I have at least 3 months of expenses. currently at 7,000/15,000. This number will change a bit once the debt above is paid off.

Pay the extra to debt will only take 1-2 months ish off if i split it up, or 3 months just one of them.

Hey Everybody,

On the road to financial independence I am looking to find out more information on Bulk Investments vs Diversification. 

What is the advantage of investing the majority of funds into 1 stock so your monthly yield is higher, vs diversification into other options to mitigate risk? 

Example:

If option A (O) is a stock giving an annual dividend yield of 4% or  .33% monthly. 

If option B (VNQ) is a ETF giving an annual dividend yield of 2.24% or around .187% monthly but is very diversified and less risky. 

Why would you not put the bulk of funds into option A for bigger ROI?

I am trying to get a handle on my finances, and the more the read the more I realize I have no idea how to handle this kind of situation.

If I get rid of my Raymor and Flannigan debt, and Best Buy Debt I believe i should be able to afford this. Would this be the best use of my funds, or would it be better suited by investing into ETFS and Mutual Funds that provide a monthly cash flow which can be reinvested?

tvhysu,IHadTacosYesterday,"How much of a lump sum do I need to pay myself $2700 per month, adjusted for inflation, for 7 full years?

Ok, let me explain what I'm trying to figure out. Let's say that I'm basically trying to find out how much money I have to save, to be able to be unemployed for 7 full years. Basically 84 total months.

My monthly bills right now are between about $2450 and $2650 per month, depending on certain fluctuating factors. So, let's say I take the bigger number $2650, and just round it up to $2700.

I basically want the 2022 buying power of $2700 for the next 84 months. Obviously, due to inflation, I will need more than just $2700 multiplied by 84 months. Now, we could say that inflation averages out to 5 percent per year. (normally I think it's closer to 3 percent, but let's be conservative. Also, because we're in such a high-inflation environment at the moment)

Now, the other thing to consider, is that I can take whatever lump sum, and put it into some sort of annuity, earning some semblance of an annual return, so that this annuity will pay me $2700 every single month (adjusted for inflation at 5 percent annually).

So, it's not a matter of taking $2700 and multiplying it by 12, then multiplying that by 1.05 every single year, and getting that grand total.

That would be correct if my overall lump sum wasn't earning any interest whatsoever, but I have to imagine that it would be earning something. I'd be starting with over 200k in the annuity (maybe close to 250k or something...)

However, I've heard other people say that as long as the Roth IRA account has been open for 5 years, any contributions can be withdrawn at any time, without any penalties.

So, for example, let's say that you opened up a Roth IRA in the year 2005. You contributed 4k that year. In 2006, if you tried to withdraw your 4k contribution, you'd face a penalty, because the Roth IRA account itself is less than 5 years old.  So, you haven't passed the 5 year rule yet. But, if you tried to withdraw that 4k contribution in 2011, you'd be fine, because the account is more than 5 years old.

All of that makes sense to me. What doesn't make sense, is that future contributions to this exact account can be withdrawn without penalties, at any time, even if these contributions haven't been in the account for a full five years.

It makes way more sense to me that any contribution that you make would need to stay in the account for 5 full years before you could withdraw it without penalty.  So, if you opened a Roth IRA in 2005, and say in 2015 you contribute 6k, but it's 2017 and for some reason you really need to get that 6k back, you can just withdraw it without any penalty. That doesn't make sense to me. But some people are claiming that this is the case.

Basically I'm trying to find out what is the actual truth on this scenario.",Yes,Yes,No,Yes,No

ux0rca,IHadTacosYesterday,"Could I be considered a first-time home buyer if my ex-wife's name was used on the two homes we had?

So, I've owned two different homes in the past, with my ex-wife. We sold the first one, and upgraded to a larger home. Then, later we got divorced and my ex-wife bought me out of the 2nd house. On both homes, I think my ex-wife was listed as the primary person on the loan.

I don't own any homes at the moment.

The only reason I'm asking this question, is because I recently applied for a Discover Card and was rejected. I received a letter in the mail explaining why I got rejected. The rejection letter said:

1. NO OPENED BANK REVOLVING TRADES
2. INSUFFICIENT CREDIT HISTORY
3. INSUFFICIENT HISTORY FOR BANK REVOLVING TRADES

I was wondering if part of the reason that I was denied is because every time me and my ex-wife would buy a house or a car or get any kind of loan, we'd use her name. Her credit was better than mine at that time. Mainly, it was better, because I simply didn't mess with credit much at all. I'm the type of person that would never have a credit card if you could get away with it.

I like paying for things in full. If I don't have money for something, I will save up, until I have enough, and then pay the whole amount. The only exception is buying cars. I'd normally put 10k down on a car, and finance the rest. But again, I'd always do it in my wife's name, and I think this practice is coming back to bite me.

This is why I'm wondering if maybe one side benefit of always putting everything into my wife's name is that I could be considered a first time home buyer, even though it's not actually true.

What say you?",Yes,Yes,No,Yes,No
v2y2z4,IHadTacosYesterday,"I'm inheriting an IRA. Should I keep all the money in the IRA, or do something else with it?

My dad passed away awhile back, and my brothers and I are inheriting an IRA that my dad had. We went to his broker place today and had to open up an ""Inherited IRA"", and then we have to have the funds transferred from our Dads IRA to our individual inherited IRA's.

My question is, what should I do with the money once it's transferred? 

I currently have a Roth IRA, and if this was also a Roth IRA, and I could somehow combine it with my existing Roth IRA, that would be awesome. But unfortunately, this is a regular IRA.

Now, I think I could just keep this IRA and buy some stocks with the money, but the problem with that is that I will be taxed once I finally start taking money out of it in the future. If I'm making less money now, wouldn't it be better to get taxed on the money now? At least 7k of it. Because I could turn around and put that 7k into my Roth IRA as a 2022 contribution. (I've already contributed to my 2021 tax year).

Unfortunately I can only put 7k of it into my Roth IRA this year, but should I get all the money out of it anyways? Reason being, my income this year is probably going to be quite a bit lower than it will be in future years. So if it counts as income, this would probably be the year to deal with it.

The amount isn't big enough to bump me to a new tax bracket.",Yes,Yes,No,No,No

I currently don't own any property (other than my car), and 99 percent of my net worth is in a handful of accounts.

Let's say that I retire, and I don't have any job. I'm working zero hours. Yet, I absolutely want to continue to max out my Roth IRA every year possible (7k per year).

My question is, let's say that I have a regular IRA (non-Roth). When you withdraw money out of a regular IRA, it gets taxed as income. Could I withdraw 7k from my regular IRA and that 7k of income will allow me to qualify for putting 7k into the Roth that year? What if I have a stock that I can sell for a short term capital gain of 7k? That would also count as 7k income for tax purposes.

I've asked this to another person one time, and was told no, it doesn't work like that.

This person said that I would need to get a part-time job and have 7k of legitimate earnings. It can't be short term capital gains profits from stock sales, or withdrawals from a traditional IRA.

Wouldn't this payment qualify as ""earned income"" for 2023? If so, wouldn't that mean that it would quality for the yearly max out requirement for me, if the payment is 7k or over.

I never knew anything about I Bonds until just recently. It seems like an absolute no-brainer investment. Better than any HYSA.

So, somebody could have bought 10k worth of I-Bonds in the first week of January this year, and they're planning on doing it again in 2023 and 2024 as well.

I didn't know that it was possible to have two different Roth IRA accounts, but I recently found out that there's nothing stopping anybody from doing it. However, you're still limited to the maximum 7k per year contribution.  (if you're 50 years old or older)


I currently have a Roth IRA with Putnam Investments, but want to instead have a Roth at TD Ameritrade. I inquired about moving my existing Roth from Putnam to TD Ameritrade, but the process is very ass backwards. It takes like 60 days for it to happen, and I'd have to sell out of the dumb Putnam mutual fund that I'm in. I hate this idea, because the market is crazy volatile right now. I could sell out of my mutual fund right now, and while I'm waiting this 60 day transfer period, the market could go on an epic rally. Then, when the Roth finally transfers, the market is at a new high, and I'm getting completely screwed in the process. I know that it wouldn't likely be that dramatic, but still.

Instead, I'm thinking of just opening up a new Roth at TD Ameritrade, and putting the whole 7k into that (for tax year 2022). If the market is still really badly beaten up this January, I'd hope to add another 7k to the TD Roth in January for tax year 2023.

Is this allowed?

Obviously, I still need to cover my arse and make sure that I don't somehow get screwed in the deal. Do I just hire a real estate attorney to check the buyer's contract?

ygla4g,IHadTacosYesterday,"Withdrawing money from a traditional IRA creates untaxed income. Why can't this income count towards putting new $$ in a Roth?

The way I understand it, when you withdraw any money from a traditional IRA, that money basically counts as income that hasn't been taxed yet, and it needs to be taxed. Let's say that you're a retired person, you don't have any job or any normal source of income. Yet, you withdraw 10k from your traditional IRA. As far as the IRS is concerned, it's like you had a job somewhere, you were paid 10k for this job, but no taxes were taken out.

Yet, I'm pretty sure that this 10k of ""income"" doesn't count towards being allowed to contribute money to your Roth IRA. Right?

The maximum amount of money we can contribute to a Roth IRA in tax year 2023 is either $6500 or $7500, depending on your age.  But, to be able to contribute $6500 or $7500, you need to earn that much at a place of employment during that same year. Thus a retired person that doesn't have any job can't contribute anything, because they aren't earning anything.

To me, it seems somewhat unfair that if you withdrew $$$ from a traditional IRA, it counts as normal income, but you can't turn around and use that income as a qualification to add more money to your Roth, without actually having ""real"" employment.

Basically, I'm just sort of ""thinking out loud"" with this post. I'm trying to make sure that I understand this correctly. If you have any thoughts on this idea, please elaborate, thanks.",Yes,Yes,No,Yes,No

My previous employer is a famous company in NYC. Their payroll department people are being extremely unhelpful on the call.

I left that job on December 6th 2021. I absolutely did not work for them after that. They had a return to office Covid era benefit where they would cover people's transport charges if they come to the office. These guys sent me a W2 with 505$ as wages. After numerous calls someone told me that those wages are for those Covid return to office benefit.

13cevn4,IndianSWE,"Am I doing the wrong thing by not buying a house.

Currently my net worth is hovering around 600K USD. I have around 120K in 401k and 470K in solid index funds like VOO, VTWO, VEU and some bond Index funds. I make around 230K a year in salary + bonus + RSUs. Plus I make around 8K in dividends every year and this amount is growing by at least a thousand each year.

I never even thought of buying a house because:

1. I am on a Visa. If in the future another Trump or even DeSantis comes to power and makes all Indians leave the US, then I would have to sell my house in a hurry along with all the other Indians leaving the country. I would have to sell my house in 60 days before leaving the country. Which would mean that I would undoubtedly lose money on my investment. So I always feared buying immovable property in the US.
2. I have been staying in the US for 7.5 years but my plan was never to permanently settle down in the US. I do plan on leaving the country permanently in the next 3 to 4 years. I have multiple houses in India. My parents have around 7 houses in India which in total add up to around 1.5 million dollars roughly. All of this were ancestral properties that were roughly acquired a decade or two after the British left India.
3. Buying and maintaining the house always sounded like a unnecessary headache to me. I have always lived in these so called ""luxury"" apartments with ""luxury"" mice and ""luxury"" cockroaches and it's much better that way than directly dealing with a landlord. I prefer renting my mice and cockroaches then owning them. :)
4. Given the fact that I was generating a steady stream of income from my investments in the forms of dividends, the difference between buying a house and renting it is not that much for me. I am getting 8,000$ in dividends annually. I used to pay 1710$ a month in rent. So the difference between the dividends and rent is 12,000$. Around 1,000$ a month. If I were to buy a house. I would at least have to pay 600$ to 800$ in property tax. 300$ in insurance. Plus I would have to pay for any repairs and maintenance out of pocket. It always felt like renting was the cheaper option. Of course recently my rent ballooned up to 2472$
5. Buying a house seemed like something married people would do. One of the biggest concerns in deciding what kind of house to buy is the quality of the school in that neighborhood. I am neither married nor do I have kids.
6. Buying a house with all of my money felt like putting all of my eggs in the same basket. Putting down 300K or 400K as down payment and borrowing 200K meant that I would have to pay interest on that amount, which again makes buying a house a more expensive option compared to renting it.
7. People who say houses will appreciate in value, my index fund investments have increased in value too. In spite of all the chaos in the market I am still 35k in profit. Till march of last year I was 100k in profit.

At this point I have more than enough money for a down payment. I am sure I am meet the income requirements for a mortgage. My Fico Score is around 790.

The only reason I am not buying a new house is because I am on a Visa. My employer filled a green card application for me, but it will take >100 years because of the Green card backlog. If I am fired from my job I will have exactly 60 days to sell my house before I leave the country.

Assuming I buy a house for 600K. If I am able to sell it for only 90% of the value during those 60 days(Which is again not that easy as I need those 60 days to try to find another job).

So I am moving to Austin and I have to buy a vehicle to get to work. My plan has changed incredibly over the past few weeks.

I went from deciding to walk to office to buying a electric bike to buying a cheap used car to buying a cheap car to outright taking a 30K loan to buy Nissan Z or Toyota Supra lol.

Safe to say that I am being very indecisive.

My basic requirements are this:

1. It has to be reliable.
2. I will be disposing off this vehicle in 2 to 3 years time and I want to be able to recover as much of my investment as possible. Previously I had a 2017 Honda civic and I managed to recover all but 4,000 dollars on my investment. I had 1 accident on it. I ran it into a snow pile. I scratched it against a stone bridge. And I still managed to recover like 83.33% of my investment on that car.

Right now these are the options I am thinking of:

1. Buying a new Toyota Corolla base model. Might work out to around 24K? If I take good care of it unlike my previous car, I think I can recover 21K to 22K back?
2. Buying a 2013 Toyota Corolla with 25K miles on it from Carmax for 19,000$? Can I sell it back for 16K? 17K if I drive it for another 25K miles in 3 years time?
3. Leasing it? I don't know how this works. But for 3 years I would end up paying 10K to 12K for the lease and I would have miles limit on it. Sounds like the most horrible option of the three?

3. If I wait a few months(2 to 3 months), I would be in a situation where I don't even have to borrow any money at all. I could entirely pay for a new car completely out of pocket. That itself would save me around 200 dollars in interest payments.

Hi all,

I've just started my career, and now that I'm making more money, I've started thinking about my financial future.

I currently make 40k per year in commercial real estate, and if I am able to stick with this job, I estimate that I will be able to make an additional 20k each year over the next 5 years.

I currently save 20% of my savings. So far I've paid off nearly all of my $27,500 truck with this savings (okay gas mileage, great depreciation rate, which is why I'm keeping it for now).

I plan on living the same lifestyle for the next five years, even given increases in income. So I will stick to spending about $32k per year and saving the rest. This means that after five years, if my income estimates are correct, I will have saved $240k.

All of my loans are paid off, so my current plan is to invest my savings in an index fund, such as VFINX. After 5 years, and at an estimated 7% annual return on VFINX, I would have approximately $277k saved.

The next part of the plan is more loose. I could see myself withdrawing my funds from VFINX and investing in properties (given my real estate background). I could also see myself continuing to build my nest egg in VFINX, but allowing myself to spend more (as I don't plan on living on $32k per year with a well paying job for more than 5 years.

I understand compound interest mathematically, but I thought you own a stock at a specific dollar value, then that value either appreciates or depreciates. Yet in compound interest, letâ€™s say you deposit $1000 at a 10% return yearly, year one youâ€™ve got $1,100, then $2,310, and so on. 

So youâ€™re adding money to your total money in that stock, which makes sense if those returns were dividends that paid out yearly and you could reinvest that amount in the stock. But it doesnâ€™t make sense when looking at it from the perspective of the stock value without dividends, such as year one itâ€™s worth $1000, year two it might be worth $1,200, year three maybe down to $900, and so on. What am I missing?

ksq86h,Internet_is_a_tool,"Is it smart for me to invest in a Roth IRA given my retirement strategy?

Hi all,

I am planning on investing a portion of my income in an index, probably VTSAX or VFINX, for the next 5+ years. I planned on opening an account with vanguard and throwing my money in there; however, I was advised that for tax purposes, I should open a Roth IRA, then invest in an index through the Roth IRA. 

I don't know much about Roth IRAs. I know I could research it, but I trust your feedback here more than internet articles and also wanted to get your perspective on whether a Roth is smart in my circumstance. 

My goal is to retire within 10 years. I make a high income which will make this possible, assuming I invest in a tax beneficial way. 

Can someone explain how investing in VTSAX through a Roth IRA works, why it is beneficial, and whether or not it is a smart decision for me (or if there is a better alternative)?

Please note, I work in commercial real estate, so investing in real estate down the road is a serious possibility for me. Are there drawbacks to Roth IRAâ€™s if you plan on taking the money out before 59 years old, such as to invest in property?

Hi all,

I will likely be investing a portion of my income in VTSAX over the next 5 years. I make $40k per year, but that will likely increase quite a bit before the 5 year mark. I am a salaried commercial real estate agent just starting my career with a firm, and so I will expect to be paid commission on sales shortly in addition to salary increases as I gain experience here. Not sure how that effects taxes. The last agent in my position started with a similar salary and made $200k per year after 3 years. 

I want to save as much money on taxes as possible while investing in VTSAX; however, it is important to note that I donâ€™t want to lock my money away as I am considering withdrawing my index investments eventually and investing in real estate (given my background).

Hi all,

Having a hard time deciding if I should keep my Tacoma. Thoughts?

I own a 2016 Tacoma, currently paid off and valued at $27,500. It gets about 17mpg average and has been driven 45,000 miles.

The benefits of the Taco: It will last forever, has little depreciation, has very low maintenance fees, I already own it (save the tax of buying another vehicle), and I know it doesn't have major problems ( less risk than buying something else).

The drawbacks of the Taco. The gas mileage is costing me $500-$1,000 per year more than if I drove something with 30-50mpg. Additionally, if I got something cheaper, I could throw the extra $5-$15k in an index and that alone could end up making me thousands per year on average when all is said and done. Do I really need a $27,500 truck?

Other things to consider: I enjoy my truck bed but don't do any kind of work that requires frequent use of it. I live in a snowy climate so its nice having 4 wheel drive. I like the looks of my truck and am otherwise happy with it, and whatever vehicle I end up deeming the ""smart decision"" I plan on driving for at least 10 years.

Sorry if this is the wrong sub, if so any better suggestions?

Iâ€™m getting my finances in order, and as most of you know, job security is a very important part of personal finance. Iâ€™ve been an intern at a commercial real estate company for about 2 and a half months. Iâ€™ve proven myself in many ways, and was even asked to get my real estate license so that I can begin handling finances. My boss is showing me the ropes and has even taken me with him on several property showings.

Iâ€™m currently considered an office manager/intern in a company of 3 people (manager, broker and me). Donâ€™t get me wrong, this is a very elite company. I was simply lucky enough to come through at the perfect time when two brokers left, and I had ties with the owner who I convinced to give me a stab at intern. Like I said, Iâ€™ve proven myself and have yet to mess up with anything, but Iâ€™m also inexperienced with real estate and I understand why it might be more feasible for my boss to get a more experienced person on the team. 

The reason my boss let me come on in the first place was not only to give me a stab at the position, but to fill a crucial role. Without me right now, the company would be seriously struggling. And I donâ€™t think my boss would be able to find an adequate replacement, nor would he even try within the next couple months.

2.

Hi all, I think I might be in a bind.  Iâ€™m pretty sure I recharacterized money that was already backdoored (backdoor Roth).  These are all non deductible contributions. 

-  I contributed $1000 to Roth in 2020 by accident, and recharacterized this amount back to traditional over the phone with fidelity the same year showing $1237 on a 2020 1099-R with box 7 = N.  Converted this to Roth shortly thereafter 

-  I contributed another $1000 to traditional and converted this to Roth same year 2020

-  I contributed $1000 to traditional in year 2021 for prior year 2020. Converted in 2021

For some reason when I was doing taxes for year 2020 I accidentally requested online at fidelity in March 2021 to recharacterize $1000 in Roth (forgetting I asked them to do this already in 2020).  It was successful.  I received a 1099-R with 7 = R (2021) in the amount of $1317 and received a letter from fidelity saying it was successful.  I recharacterized this in 2021.  This $1000 I asked to recharacterize had to already been converted to Roth since there was no other direct contribution to Roth in 2020.   Hence, a double recharacterization. 

I believe this is not allowed according to Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (TCJA) of 2017. I called fidelity to see if they would send me new forms to correct the issue but was denied. 

I turned in my 2020/2021 taxes trying to account for the extra recharacterization but I probably did it wrong as my 2021 1099-R reflects this extra $1317 converted and 2022 taxes donâ€™t make sense.

Traditional IRA = $15700

Tax on $10990 at 14% would be $1538 in taxes.  Is this correct?  This seems like a reasonable amount to pay in order to start backdoors and rollovers fresh.

18d3kdy,Ioiwin,"What to do with 401k after quit job but subject to pro-rata rule?

Hi all,

Hopefully you guys can give us a little advice.  My wife just quit her job and has a 401k with Fidelity.  She also has a traditional IRA with Fidelity and we made a mistake a few years back by putting some after-tax dollars into it.   We cannot do a reverse rollover with her 401k.  

$16700 in traditional IRA
$4800 basis in traditional IRA
$70000 in 401k

What is her best option to do with the money in her 401k?  If we transfer it to her traditional IRA she will be subject to more pro-rata rule taxes.  Her expense ratio for vanguard 2045 with her 401k is 0.08%, is this high or enough to just leave it in her 401k?

Should we first convert all her traditional IRA to Roth and pay the taxes on the $16700, then transfer the remaining $70000 to traditional IRA?

Hi all, I am considering starting an HSA account through my employer.  I just spoke with OptumBank who would hold onto my HSA account.  The max I can contribute is $7200/year.  They stated that if I ever want to remove money out of it or close the account I would have to use all of the money in the same year on medical expenses per the IRS.  I have a few questions:

1) how much should I contribute each year if I could afford all $7200?
2) do most people leave this in the HSA until after retirement and withdraw it to pay themselves or transfer it to another bank/fidelity?  If so, do people transfer to another retirement bank little by little before $65?
3) letâ€™s say I use $10,000 of $72,000 over 10 years on medical expenses only.  What can I do with the remaining balance?  Can I just withdraw the rest without having medical payment receipts?

I really, really want to live in NYC. I know wherever you spend 183 days in the year is where youâ€™re a resident for tax season but NYC has part time resident taxes.

What Iâ€™m wondering is:

1. If a taxable event came prior to a domicile change (i.e. sale today, state change later), do I still get taxed for it when I file NYC taxes?
2. I have ~$27,000 of capital losses from the past 3 years that was pushed down on my 2022 tax return. Will this offset my gains (i.e. me, not having to pay taxes)?
3. Letâ€™s say I lose $10,000 of this $22,000 (same calendar year), do I still owe taxes on the $22,000 or does it become $12,000? Or since itâ€™s same calendar year Iâ€™m fine?
4. What difference would it make if I moved to NYC on July 2nd instead of June 1st? ( <183 days vs >183 days)

Hey, I'll try and make this short. 23 years old if that makes any difference.

Basically, I'm a Business Intellegence Intern at a company in my area who just got acquired by an even bigger company. Rumor has it that since we're going through a merger that they'll be having a hard lock on salary. I'll have been there for 11 month &amp; 2 weeks (in case they try to technically skimp on the year) as of my graduation (\~May 10th). I want to start getting into salary talks in early April. I am already hired on as a full-time employee, so all it is is just the finance department compensating me more and me possibly getting another interview. The company would not have to go through an strenuous conversion process since I'm already internal, I've already spoke to HR about this.

For my assumed position of an Associate/Junior Business Intellegence Analyst, median salary in my area is $66,342 per Glassdoor. There's a salary bump over a regular BA or Systems Analysts because we are half IT and work with visualizations.

I really want to ask for $65,000 because the work we do can be very difficult, exciting and valuable to the business. It's also very exciting to me when I get a new task! I mean, some day I really have to critically think and analyze and I 110% believe what I do, and will be doing, is worth $65,000. If anyone works with data cleansing, extraction, transforming, visualization, SQL, Tableau, SSRS, business requirements etc., I'm sure you understand how messy back end data and dependencies can get.

I'm expecting the company to give me a hard offer of $58,000-$62,000. I would be OK with $62,000 but not with anything less. Do I have any leverage as an Intern? I'll have had one year of experience come offer time (may after I graduate).

Hey guys!

Iâ€™m single, rent and make 57K now in FL (no state tax). FICO 2 credit score of 740, CreditKarma credit score of 765. Student loans of &amp;lt;$14k. Graduated repayment of $80/m, then $104/m, then $135/m, $176/m, $228/m, all in two year spurts. Renting at $1,000/m. Current take home is $3200 post benefits but wonâ€™t be buying a new car until I sign an offer for higher paying job.

I have been interviewing for jobs within my field (business analytics), like 5 interviews a week, and I have two pending jobs ranging from min. 70k up to ~82k. Iâ€™m still applying though because nothings signed, but I wonâ€™t accept a new job under $70,000.

Iâ€™ve been looking at 2021 Hyundai Accentâ€™s &amp;amp; Kia Forteâ€™s. I really want a 2021 civic cause Iâ€™m a Honda guy, but theyâ€™re over $22k.

Anyways, I currently drive a 2003 civic with 223k miles on it. Aesthetically, itâ€™s garbage. But she runs amazing! Engine and transmission perfectly fine.

Within the past year, I have done both front axles, control arms, wheel bearings (guh), bushings, alignment, rear break drums, etc. I still have a power steering leak and theyâ€™ll have to replace part of the rack (thereâ€™s corrosion on the left side of the bottom of the rack). I go to my roommates father as a mechanic (has a shop, not back door). Anyways, this civic is costing me $1,000 or so YoY in replacements. Repairs havenâ€™t been just last year, Iâ€™m just going to save the time and not explain them all.

Iâ€™m a minimalist at heart and new cars freak me out. Scratches, dents, dings, higher insurance premiums, it just seems to unaffordable. Plus, since itâ€™s all suspension damage, I probably just canâ€™t drive lmao. I want to say irdgaf about keeping up with the joneses, I want freedom and to retire early.

To continue, I believe my car is $2,000 away from brand new. I need to fix the rack, get four new struts, and possibly due the timing belt/water pump and a new battery for maintenance. Other than that, I canâ€™t see anything else going wrong for a while. She does have an EVAP check light (famous P something code), which means I have to replace the cat. Iâ€™ve been driving w/ it for four years with this check light, so it doesnâ€™t need to be replaced.

Should I throw $1,500-$2,000 into my civic w/ insurance at $60/m, or should I buy a new car ~$18k after upgrades w/ a payment of ~$350/m and insurance of $200/m? I could put about 5K down. I figured buying new is the best route because of the low financing and dealer incentives.

Thanks in advance!",Yes,Yes,No,Yes,No
o7u5ty,IPatEussy,"Should a â€œjob hopperâ€ invest in 401(k)?

EDIT: 3:02P â€” I just realized this is very age dependent. Letâ€™s assume youâ€™re 25, 35, and 40. Just to spark conversation. For real world application and not theory, Iâ€™m 25.

Letâ€™s say vesting schedule is (both 50% match, up to 6%):

**Y1** - 0%

**Y2** - 10%

**Y3** - 30%

**Y4** - 60%

**Y5** - 100%

Or

**Y1** - 33%

**Y2** - 66%

**Y3** - 100%

I know thereâ€™s the obvious tax savings because of the contributions decreasing your income. However, for the lack of liquidity (not touching your money until 60 w/o penalty), **assuming you were investing in the market**, should someone who either works 6-12 month contract jobs or job hops every 1-2 years invest in a 401(k)?

I would like to hear discussions on both sides and if anyone has real world experience with either, as a contractor or constantly moving employee. 

Thanks so much!",Yes,Yes,No,Yes,No

Hi PF,

I canâ€™t help but feel weird about my current situation.

25M, earning 107k in a (I guess is Tampa HCOL now?) area. Bi weekly take home is $2900 after bennys, 401k etc.

I save about $2500/m towards my house right now. But have 0 investments. It all goes into a separate cash for housing purchase. Each paycheck $1250 hits one account w/ no card I choose not to touch and the rest in my main checking.

**Debts:**
I have 13k in student loan debt, no CC debt, no car loan. Own my car.

**Assets:**
I have 30k cash, 6k in crypto (9.5k invested), 10k in 401(k) (I donâ€™t include this in my net worth). Letâ€™s call it 36k.

4 months emergency expenses would be what â€” 8k?

So 30k-13k-8k would be = 9K. Plus incoming paycheck so letâ€™s make it 10k.

I understand markets have pulled back recently w/ the fed soon to start tapering but am I dumb for sitting on 10k cash extra? Iâ€™m trying to buy a home and that is my main priority but man, I feel like that 10k could be better â€œspent (invested)â€ than being in cash. 

Side note, Iâ€™m going through a special program (NACA) that will allow me to have no down payment on my home. Not to get too deep into detail but all I need is 6k at closing. So, I guess that makes it 4k.

What do you guys think?

Thanks!",Yes,Yes,No,Yes,Yes

Hi PF.

Havenâ€™t posted here in a long time but Iâ€™m back for some advice. Iâ€™ll try and make it as quick as possible.

**Background**:

25M

Let me preface this and say I donâ€™t really believe in retirement as the age of 59 1/2 or 55. Not sure if I make it until then? Idk, life is weird to look 30+ years out. Iâ€™m sure you guys thought this way when you were younger too. Anyways.

I just signed a job w/ a tech company for 140k base and 10k bonus split into monthly payments over 12 mos. This is legit life changing. Iâ€™ve tripled my salary job hopping since covid.

The company offers a 50% 401(k) match up to 4%, or a total of 2%.

I live in Florida so there are no state taxes. This is a fully remote position, itâ€™s in my job offer â€” I (hopefully) canâ€™t be called back into office so I believe the job security is there. 

**This is where the questions come in** â€” when I put away 4% of my salary for 401(k) in a calculator, my taxes were like 18% (just federal). If I were to put in $1,500/m, or close to IRS max, my taxes were 15.35%. 

Does it make sense to max out my 401(k) for the tax benefit? I plan on buying a home in 1-2 years and none of my 401(k) vests until 3 years with the company. Iâ€™m unsure if I will be w/ them for 3 years. I see the true money in serial job hopping and am unsure if a 2% match over 3 years would be the golden handcuffs that would make me stay.

I understand that an IRA is taxed dollars first and you can pull out anytime (why not just a stock brokerage account then)? But I donâ€™t understand a Roth 401(k).

I know that there are special loopholes like your 401(k) isnâ€™t included in assets for like student loans, canâ€™t be taken from medical expenses etc., but are there any other loopholes? I would like to take a loan out against my 401(k) for FTHB purchase but doesnâ€™t that defeat the purpose of a 401(k)? Lastly, with rates going up, wouldnâ€™t it be smarter to be in cash/I-bonds instead of 401(k) if I planned to spend the money in the short term? 

Sorry if Iâ€™m all over the place I just want to make the smartest decision. Thank you all for your time and Iâ€™m looking forward to your responses!",Yes,Yes,No,Yes,Yes
