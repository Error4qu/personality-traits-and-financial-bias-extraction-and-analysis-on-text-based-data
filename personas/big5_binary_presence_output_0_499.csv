enj9y7,_Raspootin_,"Carrying a balance makes your money work...for someone else.

I have always been a big believer in making money work for you.

But when you carry a balance, unless it's at 0% terms, you are not making your money work for you, you are making it work for someone else.

Americans average about $6,000 in debt. Even on a decent card with a decent APR, say 12 percent, you are still paying over $500 a year in interest (this assumes you make monthly minimum payments).

I have often seen the advice giving of saving money and investing, but often, it never talks about NOT doing this if you have credit card debt.

Even in a miracle of a fund that earns 12% (totally hypothetical), with $6k invested, you aren't even earning any money, because your basically paying the same in negative interest as you are positive interest.

Now, it doesn't hurt to have a little in savings to cover an emergency, but don't go building a big nest egg of savings and other investments if you carry a balance.

The name listed on my reports is ""The Bank of Missouri Retail"".

The address and phone number listed is for ""Genesis FS Card Services"".

A month or so ago, my balance went to zero. I was told ""incorrectly"", that my balance was sold to a collection agency. However, no name was listed, no contact details, anything.

So I call back and speak to a manager and was told ""We (Genesis FS) purchased it from The Bank of Missouri"". Ok..can I settle? ""Nope, pay the full balance"" (or eat shit I guess).

Genesis is the issuer of the Helzberg Diamonds Card. TBOM only lends them the money to do so.3

That seemed a little weird. I've never heard of a card issuer purchasing an account from a bank. Collection agency, sure.

SO I reached out to the Bank of Missouri and the MANAGER of the retail credit division told me Genesis is full of shit. TBOM is only a LENDER. They do not issue credit accounts on behalf of Helzberg Diamonds. They do not handle HBD credit accounts. They do not report on behalf of them either. Helzberg Diamonds has been reporting the account with their address and phone number, but sticking ""The Bank of Missouri"" on the reporting to pass the buck, I guess.

gy4zjh,_Raspootin_,"Probably going to be renting for a while.

Was all set to buy a house this year, the lending restrictions are too tight, and honestly I don't think now is the right time to buy. I personally think homes will fall in value as evictions rise due to Covid-19 and more elderly people (many homeowners are 60+) are moving into retirement homes or moving to FL/AZ.

I talked to a few mortgage lenders and the hoops one has to jump through to buy is insane in the post 2008 economy. 

For starters, apparently most banks won't lend you money unless you work full time. I have too many medical issues to work full time, none of which are considered a disability, but are debilitating.

I can be counted as a part time worker, but I guess I have to work at the same place for over two years. I was self employed for over 5 years and just started working a regular job back in March. 

Then my money is supposed to be ""seasoned"". I inherited some money and I guess I have to keep it in a separate account for two months for it to be considered ""legit"" by the banks.

I made the mistake of taking the advice of a tax professional who wrote off everything legally allowable, if you just do a simple income-expenses, my net is around $30k, slightly higher than my wife's.

This would open more doors (so to speak) and let us shop for homes that are 100-130k, which 130k is our budget (and is fine in this area).

We have months of bank statements showing over $6,000 in monthly income, but two lenders refused to look at it. They just want to use AGI, which to me is really stupid, as one can easily lie about your income on tax forms, and it seems to me no one wants to actually do any sort of leg work.

However, as gold continues to rise in value, I don't necessarily wish to do that, an alternative would be to borrow $3,000 from family and say the money was a gift, but most lenders want a letter on that as well.

Your adjusted gross income is literally the total gross income minuses expenses AND deductions.

I drive a lot being self employed, my mileage deduction last year was some $15,000, which is part of your AGI. Did I spend $15,000 on gas? Of course not. I drive a Prius and most likely spent about $2,200 on fuel.

To me, this is discrimination against self employed individuals. If a person working a regular job applied for loan, do you think they are going to account how much money they spent on food or electric? Of course not.

They always go off pay stubs for regularly employed people. 

Your tax form is NOT an ideal display of income when you are self employed, for the reasons stated above.

We are just starting to look at homes in the area we want to move to. on average we have seen decent sized townhomes go from 190,000 to 220,000. This is for a 3 bed, 3 bath, with a one car garage. The majority of them have been 3 stories as well. Hoa is about 250-340 depending on the area.

Most houses that size are much older, need at minimum 10-15k of work to be in good shape, and start at 280 on the low end.

Are townhomes a bad investment? Are the walls paper thin?

Would it make sense to buy a Townhome in good shape over a house? Our plan us to buckle down and pay it off within 5 years. We would hopefully rent it out or just sell it out right once its paid off and build our dream home, which we cant afford at the time.

We have a MAX budget of 250,000 for a new house. The only issue is that in our area the houses that are the size we want all need work for 250,000.

r/personalfinance has changed my life so thank you for your advice and wisdom.

For context I'm 29 - married a few months ago. Combined income \~$275K.

Started a new job this year and employer recently announced that they are now offering 50% match up to 6% contribution for a new t401K through Fidelity. I currently have a Roth 401K through American Funds that will combine with the new Fidelity t401K and allow me to contribute to pre-tax or/and after-tax buckets. (1) 401K / (2) buckets.

I had a t401K, pension, and HSA with Fidelity with my previous employer. Recently rolled the 401K and pension into a tIRA at Morgan Stanley. I have not made any contributions to the tIRA since the rollover. I also moved my after tax brokerage account to Morgan Stanley from CS as well and I am considering moving to Fidelity now in an effort to consolidate all these accounts. HSA remained with Fidelity.

With that being said I am seeking advice for what to do next to maximize growth and avoid fees. Here are some options moving forward:

2. Should I continue contributing to the Roth 401K (after-tax bucket) now that I have a company match for the t401K? Maybe I will contribute equal % to both buckets, contribute unequal % to each bucket, or contribute only to (1) bucket. Thoughts?

1878131,ActualSnow8383,"What is the best plan for investing going forward?

Backstory:

I have been investing a total of ~25% of my net income the past few years in both retirement accounts and taxable accounts. l invest into a total market fund. Iâ€™m in my early 30s. 

I have also have been able to save to roughly $100,000 in a high yield savings account. I have been able reach $100k in cash because Iâ€™ve only been investing 25% of my income and my expenses were low when I was younger. (All other income not spent went to savings). 

Going forward I have 3 ideas:

1. Continue to invest 25%, and let my cash level increase past $100k (if I can save beyond the 25%). 

2. Forget the 25% idea and invest everything beyond my emergency fund (leaving roughly $30,000 in cash). 

3. Keep $100,000 as a combination of an emergency fund, all future *possible* expenses/properties, engagement, vacations, cash allocation for investments, and fun money. Then invest everything beyond that number in equities. (Which would likely mean investing far higher than 25% of my income). 

My hesitation with doing option 2 is that what if I want to buy another house? What if I need the money for a wedding? Starting a side business? I donâ€™t know when or if those things will happen, but they could happen sooner than laterâ€¦

Side note/extra details:

17hsrnr,ActualSnow8383,"Should I invest or pay my mortgage down?

Hi everyone, new here! So let me give you my current financial picture: 

30 years old 

$205,000 mortgage balance @ 3.25% 

$100,000 home equity

$100,000 emergency fund in HYSA

$10,000 index funds in a taxable in the S&P 500

$2,000 taxable single stocks 

$1,000 crypto 

$25,000 Roth IRA

Other retirement accounts are maxed. 

My extra income averages about $2,000 a month. Should I throw that at the mortgage or in my taxable S&P 500 index fund brokerage account? 

In terms of time horizon?:
I currently live in a condominium (my first home) that I donâ€™t see myself living in long term, but probably at least another 3 years. Iâ€™m debating after that to either stay put, or sell and use the equity to buy a house. The other option is to keep, and it rent it out. I could end up staying altogether. But I feel like Iâ€™m a bit lost for what to do considering I have a decent savings fund filled up, and other accounts loaded up. Where to go next in the upcoming year?",Yes,Yes,No,Yes,No
17iexbk,ActualSnow8383,"What would you do with the extra money in this situation?

Iâ€™m 30 years old, and live in a condo. Ideally I would eventually like to live in a house, but that wouldnâ€™t be for at least another 3-5 years. At that time, I could either keep the condo and rent it out, or sell it and use the equity. I may also end up staying much longer. It will all depend where my life is when I cross that bridge. 

I owe a bit over $200,000 on the condo at a 3.25% interest and have roughly $100,000 in my high yield savings account. I also have another $12,000 in a taxable account in index funds, and maxed out retirement accounts. 

So, my question isâ€¦ I can save roughly $2,500 on average a month. What should I do with this money? 

My ideas are:

1. Throw every extra dollar over the $100,000 emergency/savings fund into index funds

2. Throw every extra dollar into the high yield savings account until it reaches $200,000. This would be about the amount needed to pay off the condo (if I wanted to). It would roughly take 2.5-4 years (maybe less or more depending on spending and income). Once I got to the $200,000 in the HYSA, I would put the rest/overflow in index funds and have peace of mind knowing I could technically pay the house off at any time, while still having the flexibility and liquidity of it in a savings account paying a higher rate. This would also enable me to invest more comfortably beyond this amount in my taxable account. 

So essentially, option 2 is like the exact same as option 1, just using $200,000 as the figure in the HYSA instead of $100,000. 

Since Iâ€™m not technically in my forever home, and letâ€™s say in 5 years I want a house that is $500,000â€¦even by selling the condo with a $100,000 equity and using all of the $200,000 in the HYSA, I would still need another mortgage then at $200,000, and the cycle above repeatsâ€¦

Considering my story above, what would all of you recommend doing in the next few years?",No,Yes,No,Yes,No

17ls9st,ActualSnow8383,"When would you invest $22,000 into the market if you had until January to do it?

Well thereâ€™s a catchâ€¦ technically itâ€™s only $10,000 but hereâ€™s the storyâ€¦.

So over the last 2 years, Iâ€™ve only invested in my Roth IRA ($6,500). I want to add an additional $5,000 in a taxable account on top of the $7,000 (2024 limit) in 2024. 

Additionally, I want to invest the additional $5,000 for both 2022 and 2023 that I didnâ€™t do. That would mean investing $22,000 by January. 
That $22,000 includes the $7,000 for 2024â€™s Roth IRA (that u canâ€™t invest now), and $15,000 to a taxable (2022, 2023, and 2024â€™s additional $5,000). As of right now, I have a fully funded emergency fund and plenty of cash on the sidelines. 

Iâ€™m fine with investing 2024â€™s Roth IRA and the additional $5,000 for 2024 the first week of January. What I am wondering is what should I do with the catch-up $10,000 for this year and last? 

Option 1. Invest it when I do the $12,000 for 2024. So $22,000 total first week of January. 

Option 2. $10,000 this month asap and $12,000 first week of January. 

Option 3. $5,000 this month, $5,000 in December, $12,000 first week of January. 

Option 4: $2,000 this week, $1,000 each week after the rest of the year (9 weeks left in the year including this week), then $12,000 first week of January. 

This money is for the long term, but still, I want to make sure Iâ€™m buying at a good price. We are up 11% on the year but we could also be higher or lower in January. 

Iâ€™m making January my deadline to get all $22,000 invested or else Iâ€™ll never get it inâ€¦haâ€¦",No,Yes,No,No,No
18115am,ActualSnow8383,"Can someone help me decide what to do with my money and if I am doing things right so far?

Iâ€™m 30M, single, living in a small town home. Mortgage on it is ~$200,000 @3.5% with $100,000 in equity. 

By January, I will have roughly: 
$100,000 in my high yield savings account, 
$30,000 in a Roth IRA in index funds 
$25,000 in a taxable account in index funds 
$12,000 in a Rolex 
$10,000 in a work funded retirement account 
$3,000 in single stocks 
$1,000 in crypto 

Iâ€™m looking to likely be able to save/add an additional $30,000 in 2024 the HYSA. 

Is there anything you would change? Where would you go next? 
My living plans are kind of up in the air right now. Iâ€™m content (for now) with where Iâ€™m livingâ€¦ but who knows, I may move to a different home in a few years. I may start a familyâ€¦ canâ€™t rule anything out right? 

A part of me wants to add $90,000 additionally in the taxable account, into the S&P 500, but I know I would be slightly uneasy having that much in. I donâ€™t want to be exposed enough to get my emotions involved. But I do know how much that extra $90,000 could compound to in 30 years. 

A part of me also wants to stack more cash to pay off the town home (or at least have the ability to with cash on the sidelines paying higher rate than the mortgage). 

But in reality, my plan going forward is to do a combination of both, keeping the current allocations above the same, and investing 20% of my income going forward. If Iâ€™m able to bring my cash reserves even higher than they are now while doing so, great, but I will at least know Iâ€™m still putting 20% away for retirement.

As for the money I have now, I plan on investing $70k of the $100k in the S&P 500 over the next 6 months, bringing liquid cash down to $30k. I should be able to save $30k a year going forward, which would put me back to $100k by the end of 2026. At that time I would have over $100k in cash, $130k+ invested, and $100k+ in equity in my current place. Leaving me with potentially $300k+ (if I sold everything).

I'm mostly stress typing here and not necessarily looking for advice, but it helps with my anxiety.

I know it's not \*that much\* (in both cases) but I have to admit I had a little cry over it just now. I just got word that when renewing my lease in March, my new rent will be rising $75 from 1450 to $1525. When I moved into the unit it was only $1395 because of the pandemic. 

I live in a studio in DC on $54,600 pre-tax so I'm definitely cutting it close to my limit. But I'm about to sell my car (for parts - the estimate is around $400 but I'm sure it will be lower than that) so that will eliminate my AAA and car insurance (around $65 total), and I got rid of Netflix and Discovery Plus. Those pretty simple choices will already make up for that monthly $75 loss.

Between what's in my checking right now and savings, I have just over $7,100 and I have about $21k in my 401k. No credit card debt (I use my Chase Sapphire for nearly everything) and about $21k in student loans.

I'm 30 so I know that's not that good but I'm just laying it out there.

I recently spent $1500 at the vet but I have insurance and should get $900 back (it's 90% coverage + $500 deductible) so that helps.

Sometimes the idea of moving and getting a roommate is tantalizing but I really am not the best roommate especially after living alone for so long. 

I think I just need to sit down and really focus on just every day impulse spending. One thing I did this year was start going to nice bakeries and coffee shops and I think if I focus on making that a big reward, rather than buying stupid impulse stuff during the week, it will help with the bank **and** make it more special.

I have lived in my apartment for 2 years and really love it. i can live in it without car, I'm right near a metro station and the museum I volunteer at (which means I can walk to it and not have to spend money on the metro or ride-shares since my shift starts before the metro opens), and I know most of my neighbors.

Hi all,  
I (30, F, living in Washington DC) realize that I've been overspending lately. I don't have any credit card debt, but after paying for rent this month, I'll only have $878 in my checking account before any other bills. I have about $4,800 in savings. I make about $1720 on the 31st/15th after taxes.  
While this number is certainly better than where I've been in the past, my standards for financial stability have also changed. I make a meager income for the area - mid 50s working for a nonprofit.  
My thing is - when I notice that I'm overspending, I tend to get very anxious and start panicking. But I don't really adjust my habits to the financial reality I'm in. I'm lucky and haven't yet held a balance on my card, I use it like a debit card and pay if off in full every few days.  
Luckily I got rid of my car so I got to cancel my car insurance. I am also not going to renew my $80 gym membership when it expires in July. It's only $80 but at least that will create some wiggle room.  
Also the planet fitness i got like 7 years ago and it's impossible to cancel it which is exactly what they want lol.  
I am willing to splurge on rent to live alone in a nice, comfortable safe apartment in a neighborhood I love. I understand the 30% rule and obviously that is ideal, but in DC in particular you sometimes have to make deals with the devil. I initially got the apartment as a pandemic deal at $1395. After the pandemic order was lifted, my rent increased. I'm lucky that I only pay what I do.  
The spending below is just my recurring expenses - god knows I'm an impulse spender. The grocery budget also is a bit flexible since I often don't spend $100 weekly.That's just my goal limit.

I fell in love with that activity and I'm also willing to spend that money to do something good for myself physically, socially, and mentally.  
I think it's the dumb stuff like going to starbucks or dunkin or realllly splurging on the weekends on clothes or something that hinders me.

Hi all,

I was just notified that I am receiving a mid-year bonus(!) after a lot of turnover and me taking on more work.

Before taxes, the bonus is $3,858. I live in DC and work in Maryland.

I have around $21,800 in student loans and about $5,000 in savings. No credit card debt.

Should I put it into savings or use it to pay off some loans as they restart?

172m2cm,ActuaryPersonal2378,"Wanting to make a big purchase that I know I'll use but it makes me anxious

I think I posted in this group that I recently received a bonus at work. That brings me to (at the moment) $6,000 in savings and $2k ish in checking (recently was traveling and not all of the things have posted on my card yet but I pay my card daily as things become available.) I live in a high COL area (DC).

I made the decision to save most of my bonus and then make one bigger purchase with it. After taxes the bonus was $2280. I want to buy an erg/rowing machine. I'm a rower and I've been using the erg off and on since high school (I'm 31) and I always knew that if I were to ever buy a piece of equipment it would be that.

I'm confident in my decision to buy an erg, but I am having a very hard time making the leap and purchasing it. It's about $900 for the model I want/fits my needs. It's the model I've always used and I want to set myself up for success by not having to learn a whole new model. Concept 2 is also the standard erg for rowers, unlike some cheaper, lower quality machines.

The only debt I have is student loan debt around $21k. The rest of the bonus went to my emergency fund. I see spending the money on it as an investment because I know I'll use it and in the long run it's way cheaper than a gym membership. 

Things are pretty stable right now with the exception of student loans restarting - which will run about $180 a month. I have a pet, but I have pet insurance included in my budget which covers 90% of care she'd need, and so on.

Making this purchase scares me, but I know it will be a good one. I just need to suck it up and buy it.

17frklh,ActuaryPersonal2378,"But my heart told my head ""This time no""

I recently got a mid/3rd quarter bonus. I work at a nonprofit and make about **$55k a year** (before taxes) in DC. A midyear/not end-of-year bonus is new to me. I'm in my 2nd year at this company and from what I understand, year-end bonuses are somewhat expected.

I wanted to use this bonus to put most away and use part of it for fun. I have **$2840 in checking** and **$6075 in savings**. (and around $300 in credit card charges that are pending but I pay off daily as they roll in, so see it as $2500 in checking). 

I really want to buy a Concept 2 erg. For context, I row as a hobby. Granted I'm not a competitive rower or anything, but I know how the erg works and it's my preferred workout. Buying one would not be an impulse. I'm 31 and rowed in high school as well as this year and it's the only workout equipment I feel confident using. I recently did not renew my gym membership because it was $90 a month. I also recently lost a ton of weight and since I stopped rowing on the water bc the season ended, I've gained 4 pounds. I want to buy the erg to invest in my health. the Erg after taxes and shipping and stuff is **$11000.**

Below is my tentative budget. Please keep in mind that my utilities vary and are unlikely that high each month. this month they were around $36. I also don't often spend $100 on groceries weekly, but I do allot that much.

Also, this budget operates as if I had $0 in checking before the paychecks and was only operating on the $1720 deposited twice a month. 

Another caveat, the cat food is usually not spent each month. It seems like more of an every-other month type deal. But when doing this budget, I wanted to err on the side of including too much in the calculations rather than unexpected expenses.

Lastly (hopefully) I did add in netflix recently. I'm debating what streaming service to get rid of for now. I think this will likely be HBO as the shows I watch are not out rn. But let's be real I might just keep them both.

TLDR, can I get permission to get the erg lol? Can I? Can I?

I messed up my rollover my putting the wrong thing for the FBO. I was an idiot and put my old company - so the checks I got were made to my old company.

Additionally - I am such an idiot because I did not realize that you can't rollover a Roth into my new company's 401k. So now I'm screwed because I included my Roth in the rollover.

I (30/F) have about $5k in savings right now - the most i've ever had...much of it was from luck after getting a high tax refund and a vacation payout from my old job when i left. 

Needless to say I am working to establish that emergency fund.

However - there is a trip I want to take next year in the San Juan Islands, Washington, and the location sells out very very fast. 

I'm thinking about ""loaning"" myself the money to set up the initial reservations that are refundable if shit hits the fan (up until a certain amount of time before the trip). 

The two big chunks I'm tempted to tackle now are for a very specific excursion that will sell out fast - that is $300. It's a multi-hour wildlife viewing trip and it would be \*why\* I'm taking the vacation.

The second is the hotel for part of the trip. I want to get that down especially because things are already starting to sell out - the hotel is relatively affordable for the area so it's bound to sell out asap

Im 31 years old, no kids, not married, with no credit card debt but I only have a 401k currently (contributing at 5% to get the company match of 3%). From what I read, I should put money in a savings account so the money is growing but Iâ€™m curious what other people would do in my situation who are more money savvy. 

Income: $140,000 ($3000 monthly after bills paid) 

Checking: $40,000

401k: $30,000

Debt:

$30,000 student loans (I only have unsubsidized and subsidized loans through the government and the interests rates range from 3.5-6.8 depending on the loan amount) 

$150,000 mortgage (3% interest rate)

$25,000 car (5.59% interest rate)


My goals are to have money to travel, and invest my money so I can have it grow and have money so I can retire. I feel like Iâ€™m behind on using my money to grow it.  

Should I increase my 401k contribution and start a Roth? 

Thanks for your help!",Yes,Yes,No,Yes,Yes

10p4r6x,agjjnf222,"What to do about taxes with student loans and newly married? Details below

Hey everyone,

I recently got married in September of 2022 and my wife are figuring out what to do about taxes. We do have a tax guy but just curious what your thoughts are:

I roughly make 95k + productivity bonus per year which is usually 20-30k paid quarterly( 6-7k per quarter). It fluctuates but my take home pay every two weeks is 95k gross.

I have 128k from grad school in debt with a minimum payment of 1600 at 2.8% private (refinanced in 2020). I am happy with this and it is manageable from an income standpoint.

My wife makes roughly 60k gross with 48k in private loans. Her dad was the co-signer and has been paying these up until now. $600 min payment with variable rates (working on getting refinanced) but we are taking these over. Again, this is manageable.

My wife also has 27k in defaulted loans that we didnâ€™t know about (I know I know) and I am enrolling her in the fresh start program which brings them out of default and back into normal federal loans. We have until June when the pause is supposed to end to figure out payment plan. Iâ€™m not too worried about it but just some questions.

1. Would it be more beneficial to file separate or joint in terms of all things considered above? Or does it all depend on other tax liabilities?

2. If we file joint then I am just afraid that her 27k new payment will be based on both incomes and a lot higher, so is that just something my tax guy can help me with?


Thank you for the help.",Yes,Yes,No,Yes,No

Breakdown of finances:

- Me(31m): 115k pretax (quarterly bonuses 8k-10k post taxes)

- wife(29f): 60k pretax

- monthly take home: $9600

- mortgage: $294k $1400/month 2.875% (house is valued at 670k after natural disaster rebuild)

- my car: paid off 2018 Elantra

- wifeâ€™s car loan: 16k $340/month

- my student loans: 120k $1500/month 3.1%

- my wifeâ€™s student loans total: 70k $600/month ~4.5 average

- NO CC debt ( credit scores 775, 740 respectively)

- my 401k: $15k, putting in 6% to get max match

- my traditional IRA: $25k, my Roth: $20k

- wife doesnâ€™t have match so not contributing to her 401k until debt is down

- savings: $15k

- total monthly expenses minus debt: $4000

- extra money: savings and debt primarily per month. My quarterly bonuses which just started usually go 75% to debt, 25% for house projects

On track to pay off student loans in 5-6 years (depending on life: we donâ€™t have kids yet) which will free up about $2500 in monthly income plus the bonus money we donâ€™t put in.

Plan after debt:

- max Roth for wife and I

- max hsa and 401k

- listen to my FA

I have a great FA who I am really happy with. I donâ€™t like messing with investments and stuff and he still says we are in good shape. I believe we will be able to catch up quickly based on income being freed up.

15mhlr9,agjjnf222,"How do I make sure Iâ€™m not going over the max for 401k?

My employee matches 100% up to 3.5%.

On top of my base salary, I also receive quarterly bonuses ranging in the 7-10k range.

Since my bonus comes as a paycheck when I get my bonus then my automatic 401k contribution percentage is taken out of the bonus.

I currently have it set at 6% which is not maxxing until I pay some debt down but other than just keeping up with it monthly how do I make sure that my normal contributions plus the bonus contributions do not exceed the max?

Again my bonuses range from 7-10k or 5k on a low quarter so just trying to navigate the best strategy once I get to the point of maxxing.

Or can I just check my total contributions and adjust my contribution late in the year if Iâ€™m getting close? I would like to max by end of year to maximize match.

Thanks!",No,Yes,No,No,No
16igfep,agjjnf222,"Quarterly bonuses come as paychecks. How do I cancel the 401k contribution from bonus?

For context, I work in a job that pays me quarterly bonuses on top of my base salary.

Base: 108k gross

Quarterly bonuses: 15-18k gross

Now I have about 190k student loans so on top of minimum payments I am basically using  my bonuses to completely dump into debt.

My problem is that they come through our normal payroll system and the last one got hit with my 401k contribution of 6%.

Last bonus contribution: $1k

I am contributing to 401k to get the match but Iâ€™m more concerned with getting rid of my debt first. (Goal of 3 years)

My two options:

1. Set my contribution to 0% right before each bonus payout and do this every time.

2. Talk to plan representative to see if there is a way to not include bonus contributions (not likely)

Any thing I have missed or advice?",No,Yes,No,No,No
16oheyb,agjjnf222,"How do I help my wife from overspending? Details below.

My wife and I have been married for over a year. We have a great relationship and I believe that our financial goals are aligned most of the time. The main point of this is to ask for advice not from a money stand point but just a mentality perspective.

We both make good money and are able to save and travel and do things we want to. We have a good amount of student loan debt but expected to pay off in 3-4 years. Iâ€™m not going to get into the weeds if our expenses as that isnâ€™t really the problem.

6 months into marriage my wife and I made the decision that for her â€œfun moneyâ€ she will get $250 every other week. I would say 95% of the time this works really well. I budget everything so it allows her to basically buy whatever she wants with that money. I also make sure credit cards are paid off.

I think the problem stems from us having different mentalities about money as well as different expectations.

I live more frugally and would like to just sacrifice the next couple years and pay off debt then be good. She is more care free and sees it as we will eventually pay them off but we still have to enjoy our life now. We have to find a middle ground.

Here are some scenarios that seem to have happened lately:

1. I told my wife two nights ago she had $20 left in her fund. Yesterday she buys a $50 item therefore going over her fund. She said itâ€™s fine because I get more tomorrow. Now Iâ€™m not worried about the money but that type of thinking is how people get into cc debt by spending money you donâ€™t have. Difference in mentality.

2. I get paid quarterly bonuses about 8-12k and have one in October. She also has a side gig through fall that can net her 7-8k. We owe 16k on her car at $350 a month which is fine but I see it as we could combine our bonuses to knock it out and have left over. She sees this as a house fund for her to continue to decorate and do things for the house. Again, difference of opinion on what to do with that money. 

3. She wants me to handle everything when it comes to paying bills, paying ccs, talking to our FA but she gets annoyed when I ask her about charges. â€œHey is this a house item or a fund item?â€ And the usual response is something like â€œIâ€™m not going to live forever with you breathing down my neck.â€ Now again I donâ€™t care what her fund is used for. It was a mutual discussion and agreement we had but in order to track said fund then I have to know what the fund purchases are. She said she keeps up with it but again see number 1.

Overall, I just feel alone in the journey to financial freedom. We make great money, we travel, we do things that we want. We donâ€™t have any credit card debt so itâ€™s not a money problem. I just see it as her not letting go of her single life where she could do whatever she wanted with her money. Itâ€™s always a battle when it comes to spending. I donâ€™t care about $50 purchases. I do care that there seem to be a blurred definition of needs and wants. Instead of taking 5k to spend on house decor and furniture, why isnâ€™t the obvious choice to pay off her car therefore freeing up $350 a month in income? 

Why is it that my bonuses are the ones going to our debt and she can use hers for the house? Sure I like having nice things in our house but I also like freeing up income by knocking out debt. 

Am I just being too frugal? Is she being unreasonable? 

How do I bridge the gap? 

Thanks for reading!",No,Yes,No,No,Yes
16reucw,agjjnf222,"What debt to tackle first? We have multiple loans across different lenders.

My wife and I have around 200k of debt. 

Hereâ€™s the breakdown:

1. her car: 16k at 5.35% $350 monthly 

2. my loans: 120k at 2.8% $1550 a month

3. her private loans: 33k total with various rates (monthly is $200)

   - $9,278 at 4.66%
   - $9,897 at 6.8%
   - $8,035 at 3.86%
   - $3,831 at  3.4%
   - $1,103 at  3.86%
   - $1,091 at 6.8%

4. Her federal loans: 45k at 6.5% $400 a month

Our house hold income is roughly 170k but I also get about 10-12k per quarter in bonuses which will be for debt. Next one is in October. We arenâ€™t putting much monthly into them other than minimums.

Option 1:

 - tackle car first as it is fourth highest rate and having that $350 a month back would be nice. Could probably put 8-10k in October and then finish it off in January with next bonus.

Option 2: 

 - use bonus in October to pay the two 6.8% loans in her private loans which makes up almost 1/3 of that total. We did a lower payment plan if we want to put extra money towards it a month.

I am leaning towards the car as the monthly is higher and I know there is some psychological effect to â€œchecking offâ€ on some debt. I also am leaning toward the higher 6.8% rates as they are the highest simple as that.

What do yâ€™all think?

TLDR: snowball method or avalanche method?",Yes,Yes,No,Yes,No
16tl9c3,agjjnf222,"My FA said Iâ€™m doing great. More of just an encouragement post.

Hey everyone,

I am someone who has an FA and I couldnâ€™t be happier. We do quarterly meetings to check in and strategize how to take care of debt and retirement.

Reasons why I decided to get an FA:

- I work in medicine so I have a high earning potential

- I enjoy finances but I didnâ€™t want to be completely in charge

- it has saved me an incredible amount of stress and headaches knowing that I have someone who lives and breathes this stuff. My FA has a masters in applied economics (I know this doesnâ€™t really matter but he knows his stuff)

Now on to the point of this post:

I am 31 and currently have 190k in student and car loans between my wife and I. Household income of 170k roughly and I also receive about 50k in bonuses a year.

Seeing that debt number has always scared me but it scares me less knowing that I have a plan.

The problem I always had was do I put more to debt or savings or both? How the hell do I get on top of this?

In comes my FA. We sit down quarterly to talk debt strategy, retirement, and overall how the market is doing. I am naturally an anxious person so these meetings really help me put things into perspective. 

Last night, he told me that I am in good shape and actually contributing a good amount to retirement despite me thinking otherwise. It was this small statement that made me realize â€œoh everything is going to be fine.â€

I wouldnâ€™t call this a light bulb moment but damn near close to one. Being able to have this conversation with someone who handles other clients and knows his stuff gives me a little encouragement in knowing that Iâ€™m on the right track.

Now Iâ€™m not saying that everyone needs an FA but I do feel that it is the right move for me.

I also write this to give encouragement to those who donâ€™t think they are on the right track.

If you have a plan then you are already miles ahead of others. If you donâ€™t have a plan then that is step one. You will figure it out no matter what.

Iâ€™m not sure who said it but â€œanything in life worth having is not going to be easy, but it will be worth whatever it takes.â€

17m2b1v,agjjnf222,"Escrow/mortgage question ?

My wife and I went through a natural disaster home rebuild last year and I just have some questions about upcoming property taxes so hereâ€™s the breakdown:

2021:

- bought house for 325k with 5% down so mortgage was about 308k 2.8% rate $1750/month

December 2021: house destroyed from tornado

2022: I continued to pay mortgage because we had that rate so insurance was paying for living and I paid mortgage

May 2023: I got a $6k surplus from escrow as the assessment was too high. (I assume because they did their annual assessment and all I had was an empty lot where my house once stood.) my payment dropped from $1750 to $1400.

We moved into our house in March 2023 and now Iâ€™m getting our property taxes. (~$3k) but online my escrow balance is at $400.

Long story short, I continued to pay our mortgage while we had a tornado rebuild last year so when they did the assessment last year it was an empty lot so my monthly payment went down and now itâ€™s going to go back because we now have a house there.

I know I should have assumed that but itâ€™s just like a gut punch knowing that â€œoh we have to redo our goals and budget for next year because of thisâ€ now.

It feels like every time I feel comfortable where we are I get knocked back a step and itâ€™s exhausting.

I am on my wifeâ€™s insurance as she works for a bigger corporation and they offer two options so any advice would be helpful as we prepare for kids in the next year or two (however long it takes). We are both fairly healthy and donâ€™t take medications.

- out of pocket max: $9k

- coinsurance: 80%/20%

- emergency room: $300 copay + 20%

- telemedicine/urgent care/PCP: $20 copay

- prescription retail: $10/$35/$75/25% coinsurance/$350 maximum

- Per paycheck: $207

- deductible: $6k

- out of pocket max: $10k

-coinsurance: 80%/20%

I make roughly $82k a year (pre-tax); paycheck is $3400 gross, slightly under $1900 net. I contribute 18% to my retirement (all pre-tax), plus I get 6% match from my company.

For retirement, I have $35.2k in a Traditional 401k, $26.5k in a Roth 401k, and $2k in a Traditional IRA.

In cash, I have $18.1k between two savings accounts, two goal accounts, and one Holiday Savers account. Additionally, I have $2k between two checking accounts (I would exclude these overall as I use these to pay my living expenses from and the balance ranges from around $500 to as high as $4k), and $3.5k in dedicated emergency funds. I save around $1k a month to my various savings accounts.

I also maintain a Robinhood account and hold around $3600 in stocks, ETFâ€™s, and bonds. I contribute around $200 a month to it.

I have one credit card that I use for expenses and I do not carry a balance.

My only debt is a total of $13,491 in federal student loans at 0% interest with the freeze, 4.66% when payments resume. My monthly payment is $259. My car is paid off (I shouldnâ€™t need one for a number of years and I have a sinking fund savings account for car expenses, which is included above). I carry no other loans or debt.

I am interested in buying a house in the next 8-24 months, but I am not exactly sure on timeframe. Primarily, the market I live in is aggressive and interest rates are still high. I am contemplating paying off my student loans (pending what happens with SLF) and waiting until the end of 2024 or mid-2025 to buy a house.

I am concerned that I will deplete my savings with a downpayment and closing costs. Also, home prices have gone up by around 25% in the last two years and the market is still very aggressive. I donâ€™t know when it will get better and I am concerned it will take years to stabilize and prices will continue to climb.

For reference, an identical townhome I looked at in 2019 (that time priced at $179,000) just sold for $209,000. I am looking at home between $150,000 and $225,000; though I am worried that cost might be too high for me and I donâ€™t want to overextend myself.

What is a better option?",No,Yes,No,No,Yes
131xp9m,AlexRyang,"Credit limit increase

My bank offered to let me increase my credit card limit from $5,000 to $10,000 a couple months after I got the card and I declined. Was that a mistake?",No,Yes,No,No,No
133wb55,AlexRyang,"When to pay off credit card

I use my credit card for my daily expenses and move the money from checking to a dedicated savings account.

Is it better to pay off my card as I use it (charge comes through on card), weekly, or monthly? If I pay it off before the monthly bill comes in, does that hurt my credit score?",No,Yes,No,No,No
133x463,AlexRyang,"Liquidating stocks but uncertain of tax implications

I have around $3500 in stocks, bonds, and ETFâ€™s in a Robinhood account, with about $800 being purchased in the last year. I am down around $500 overall (I bought a few bad stocks in hindsight).

The caveat is that my stocks purchases in the last year have seen slight gains.

Will I still pay short term capital gains on the stocks I bought in the last year, or does the loss in my longer term holdings negate that? I know capital gains are taxed differently for short versus long term.",No,Yes,No,No,Yes
1361xvl,AlexRyang,"Reducing retirement contributions for first home downpayment

I am looking to buy a house in the next 18-20 months and I am beginning to aggressively save to both pay off my student loans (when forbearance ends) and have enough for a downpayment and closing costs. I am estimating I will need $36k to $40k for the combined costs.

I was saving 18% to my retirement, plus 6% for employer match, for a combined 24%. I just cut my retirement contribution to 8% (minimum for employer match), for a combined 14%.

EDIT - Finances:

Income: $82k pre-tax

Debt: $14k (student loans)

Savings: $23.5k (savings), $1.5k (checking)

Retirement: $63.5k (401k), $2k (IRA)

Other: $3.5k (brokerage, planning to liquidate)

I am looking at homes between $175,000 and $225,000.

Is this a sound decision? It hasnâ€™t started pulling yet and I am waffling if I should readjust before it kicks in.",No,Yes,No,No,Yes
13u4j34,AlexRyang,"Gifting Money to Parents

My dad cashed out his IRA in 2014 to pay for my first year of college. He told me it wasnâ€™t a high balance and he had a few pensions, a 401k, and other accounts that it was fine. He retired in December 2022.

It would have been roughly $17k. I am almost done paying off my student loans and at some point in the next few years, I would like to gift him some (or all) of the money back.

What is the best way to do this without incurring a major tax bill or messing up his taxes?",No,Yes,No,Yes,No
141rsub,AlexRyang,"Pay off my student loans?

I (27M) am currently waiting to see what happens with the proposed SLF program (not optimistic, but no harm in waiting, IMO). I am an engineering making approximately $85k a year pretax, $55k take home. I contribute ~$570 a month to my 401k (I recently dropped back on my 401k savings as a temporary measure to begin saving for a down payment), plus my employer match.

I have $13,685 left on my student loans, all federal, average interest rate of around 4.2% after the forbearance ends (70% of the balance has an interest rate over 4%, ~$4k has an interest rate of 3.76%).  My monthly student loan payment is $260 and I carry no other debt, other than a credit card I pay off weekly to bi-weekly (depending on balance) and I do not carry a balance month to month.

I have the following liquid savings:

$15,500 between two savings accounts

$1,700 between two checking accounts

$4,000 dedicated emergency fund including a $1,000 buffer in a supplement savings account I use as a â€œbankâ€ for CC purchase money

$1,700 in specialized savings (Holiday Club and a car sinking fund)

$3,000 for a home down payment (slowly increasing)

$2,500 for student loan repayment

$3,500 in a Robinhood brokerage account

**Total Saved: ~$30,000**

I have the following illiquid savings:

$65,000 in employer 401k

$2,000 personal IRA

**Total Retirement: $67,000**

If I pay off my student loans today, I will have $13,000 left, excluding my Robinhood account. Based off my current estimates, come August, if I pay them off at this point, I will have $16,000 in savings, plus my Robinhood account.

Is it a smart idea to pay off my loans come August? Especially since I would like to buy a house in a year and a half or so? I feel like it is and I will still have some buffer if an emergency does happen, but a small part of me is hesitant.",No,Yes,No,No,Yes
14dk6fm,AlexRyang,"Paying off large loan from multiple accounts

I have roughly $13.2k left on my student loans and by the time repayment resumes, I will be at $12.9k on them. I can pay them off at that point, but it will involve two different bank accounts held at two separate credit unions. One will come from my current bank and will be roughly $4.2k of it and the balance of $8.7k will be from my other account.

I moved a few years ago and I opened a new account at a local credit union about 8 months ago. I still have my old credit union account open but I have not had the ability to close it yet due to distance and the fact I need both my parents present to close it. I also have an IRA currently locked in a bond until September.

I know there are laws that penalize structuring. I am not trying to structure (I frankly donâ€™t care if the IRS wants to investigate it, I have nothing to hide), but I am concerned it will give the appearance of such.

What should I do/how should I address this? Should I notify my banks and student loan holder ahead of time? Do I need to notify the IRS?",Yes,Yes,No,No,Yes
14h0g25,AlexRyang,"Should I get Umbrella Insurance

I am 27 and I am contemplating getting umbrella insurance. Is it worthwhile to hold this? I was looking at my insurance providerâ€™s option for this.

I am currently looking into a MBA and realistically, the program will cost me between $40k and $100k. I am planning on starting for the fall of 2024. I was originally planning to buy a house and was looking to buy at the beginning of 2025, so I am saving money for a down payment.

However, now I am debating if it makes more sense for me to just pay for my MBA as much as I can, and as I go through the program. Interest rates are pretty high and I think it may make sense to avoid high interest student loans. In theory I would have around $30k saved by the time I would need to pay for the first semester.

But if I pay as I go, it will likely push my home purchase to 2026 or 2027. And it seems like the housing market will just be getting worse in the future.

18iioej,Allears6,"How to ask for a raise as a first time high earner?

Had my annual review today with my boss. According to him & other department heads I am an asset to the company and have blown away all expectations with no negative feedback.

I am currently trying to convince them to send me to night school for specific certs related to my job. The issue is it will cost the company 35k for me to go so they are hesitant.

I would love an increase in my base compensation considering I've gone above & beyond what they anticipated, but I feel like I can't ask for both more money & the certifications. 

In my mind the best method is to wait until they give me a final answer about the schooling. If they approve it I wouldn't ask for a raise this year but if they deny it I would ask for a increase in compensation instead.

okjjqt,Allears6,"RV loan question



I travel about 8 months out of the year for work and looking to move towards RV living. I was employed for 5 years pre covid, did contract work/ some unemployment through 2020/early 2021. Then started my new job at the beginning of 2021. My credit is young (5 years) but score is 750+. Depending on the month I make anywhere from 12-15k gross with great job security and raises for years to come. I would be able to put 40-50k down as a down payment at the end of this year in my off season. I lived in an apartment for 3 years prior and now live with family on my time off rent free to save as much as I can. If you were a lender would my profile have a solid case for a loan? My ballpark is a 60-100k loan plus my down payment for a nice Class A or Super C.

So my fiancÃ© had poor judgement before we met in 2012, financed a car (17k), didnâ€™t make payments after two years and then it was later repossessed. The lender sold it and sent him a letter asking for the remaining balance (6.2k). He ignored it and no follow ups were ever sent. When looking at credit Karma, the debt was charged off as bad debt in December 2014 and hasnâ€™t really affected the credit score since, it is now up to 750. We havenâ€™t heard from the loan company since. 

Today we get a letter that the original lender sold the debt to a collections agency. I assume they can take him to court over it still, but why now? Could it still go back and affect his credit even though itâ€™s been charged off already?

j2unn1,AllUNsaregone,"Unique (I think) should I move out question

So my fiancÃ©e, our daughter (5), and I have been living with my dad since she was born. We were pretty young and I was still in college. Since then, I have gotten a great job and we have saved up a good chunk of money. The problem is we have been house hunting for nearly 2 years. The market is horrible. We have put 7-8 offers in (yes, over asking) and just keep getting outbid and sometimes houses sell within hours before we can even go look at it. Plus there is very little inventory in the first place!  Itâ€™s getting very frustrating. We have 85k in cash for down payment, emergency fund, and furniture. 
My question is should we just take a break from house hunting and get an apartment that would cost ~$1200 a month incl utilities? My dad doesnâ€™t care that weâ€™re here, and may even prefer that we stay, and also refuses to take any money towards rent. However weâ€™re 26 and we feel itâ€™s time to move out. I guess I am just asking what you would do? We save $2000 a month in cash that just keeps going towards the house fund pot. So if we moved out, it would then be $1000 towards the pot.

Originally when we started looking I wanted to keep our budget between $190k-$215k. Obviously those same houses are now way higher. I recently found a great house that is listed $250k. And of course now all competitive offers are going over and require appraisal guarantees. So I did $272k and 11k guarantee. We have quite a bit of cash, and want to have $29k leftover as an EF but this increase in dollars needed to close will eat into that. So I want to stop our maxing 401k contributions for just 7-8 months and get some extra cash into our accounts. 

For reference, we are 27/28 and our current retirement balance is $167k. Our combined pretax income is $136k, so we are already ahead of common recommendations to be at 1x income by 30. So I feel this is not a big deal.

* Contribute to 401k/457b plans through our workplaces. Neither of our employers offers matching. We also do not qualitfy for a HSA.
* Start saving up for a new car. Ours is quite old and likely to need replaced in the next \~1-5 years. We'd probably buy a used car for around $15k. We do have good credit so not sure if it will be worth buying in cash vs getting a loan.
* Start saving up for a house or condo.

* Pay off student loans. We have $30k in federal student loans (4.5% interest). Currently they are in deferrment and if they're not forgiven, we're planning to make only minimum payments, but there's also the option to pay these off faster.

Rent in our SoCal city is very high, but we can live in subsidized student housing until I graduate. Currently we are living on my stipend and saving my spouseâ€™s paychecks.

lm0iuz,AlzScience,"Optimizing the best combination of credit cards for max rewards

My spouse and I currently just have a general 1.25% cash back card. Now that we've built up strong credit scores, we're now looking to get some cards with better rewards. This is our current plan:

|Category|Credit card (cash back)|Annual reward cap|
|:-|:-|:-|
|Groceries|Amex Blue Cash Preferred (6%)|$360 (note: $95 fee)|
|Gas and transit|Amex Blue Cash Preferred (3%)|Unlimited|
|Dining|Chase Freedom Flex (3%)|Unlimited|
|Rotating quarterly categories (Amazon, gas, dining, etc.)|Discover It Cash Back (5%) + Chase Freedom Flex (5%)|$600 for both cards combined|
|Large planned purchases (electronics, furniture, etc.)|US Bank Cash+ (5% on two chosen quarterly categories)|$400|
|Everything else|Citi Double Cash (2%)|Unlimited|

We're going to slowly build up these cards (5 in total) over the course of 2 years. A few important notes:

* We will definitely NOT carry a balance on any cards or spend more than we normally would just to get the rewards.
* All of these except the Amex have no annual fee. We spend a lot on groceries (HCOL area, plus we love to cook and are athletic/eat a lot) so this fee is definitely worth it. All the other fee-charging cards I've checked out were not worth it to us, though I'm open to suggestions.
* It will definitely be a little complex to keep track of which card to use for each purchase, especially with the rotating categories. However my spouse and I enjoy geeking out over this kind of thing so I think it should be fine. Plus, accidentally using a sub-optimal card for a small purchase isn't a big deal.
* We do not expect to actually hit the reward caps for most of the cards, as we aren't huge spenders. Outside of non-CC expenses (for example, rent charges fees to pay with a CC so we don't use them), we only spend about $10k a year. However I calculated that we should be getting around $450-500 a year in rewards. The sign-up bonuses also add nearly $1000. I'm pretty happy with that level of free money for minimal effort!

m5rncu,AlzScience,"The opportunity cost of paying off low-interest debt early

Just a fun thought experiment I calculated today. Spouse and I have a total of $30k in student loans at 4.5% interest (assuming no loan cancellation happens and ignoring the current deferment for calculations sake). We have enough money to pay it off right now, or we could invest that money instead. Which is better?

Option 1: Early payoff. With minimum payments, it would take us around 18.5 years to pay them off, so be paying them off early we save $14k in interest. Sounds great, right?

Option 2: We invest the $30k and make only minimum payments toward the loans, paying them off in 18.5 years. Assuming an average rate of return of 10%, our initial investment would grow to nearly $167k in that time! Thatâ€™s a net profit of over $153k after subtracting loan interest. Of course that money will continue to grow after the 18.5 year period, netting even higher profit. 

This is not to say that paying off low-interest debt is always a bad thing. However itâ€™s important that you consider the opportunity cost when making your decision. A lot of people think about the interest on the loans, but donâ€™t consider the potential market growth. Food for thought! 

Also paying off in full and making minimum payments are not the only options. For example some people may choose to max their tax-advantaged retirement accounts and use only the leftover money for loan payoff. Thereâ€™s no right or wrong answer, just run the numbers and make a decision based on your own goals and risk tolerance!

Edit: Less extreme example for some context. Say we have an extra $200/mo. If we put that toward loans, we are now paying double the minimum. We pay them off in 7.3 years and save $9k in interest. If we invest that money instead, after 7.3 years our profit would only be around $13k on average, though that profit will widen the longer we keep the money invested. Again, both options are solid, so just take the time to run your numbers and make the best decision for you.",Yes,Yes,No,Yes,No
mankhw,AlzScience,"Considering traditional vs Roth when below the contribution limit

I understand that a Roth is normally best for low income earners since you can pay your taxes while in a lower bracket. However, does this still apply when you are below the contribution limit? For example, letâ€™s say I have enough extra money to contribute $3000 to an IRA this year. If I go Roth, I pay taxes up front and not in retirement. However, with the traditional I can save myself $360 in taxes. If I then invest tha $360, it can compound over time to potentially be worth more than the tax benefits. Is my thinking correct here? Is it better to go traditional when it can allow you to contribute more?",Yes,Yes,No,No,No
mb1afe,AlzScience,"Should we convert our traditional to Roth IRA? If so, when is the best time?

Over the course of the last two years, my spouse and I deposited around $6k to a traditional IRA. This allowed us to reduce our income low enough to qualify for the maximum Saver's Credit both years. This year our income went up quite a bit (though still in the 12% bracket) and it's unlikely we'll be able to get anywhere near the max for the Saver's Credit for the foreseeable future, so we probably won't make any more traditional contributions. Should we go ahead and convert the traditional IRA to a Roth? Are there any potential drawbacks besides having to pay taxes on the money? Should we do this ASAP or wait until later in the year/closer to the tax filing season?",Yes,Yes,No,Yes,No
mcztn6,AlzScience,"Converting Trad IRA to Roth IRA. Can I skip paying estimated tax if income last year was low?

I'm planning to convert \~$6k in a Trad IRA to a Roth. Our marginal federal tax rate is 12%, so we'll need to pay around $700 in taxes. However, from what I can find on the IRS website, you can avoid the tax underpayment penalty as long as your total withholding is at least 100% of the previous year's taxes. Our 2020 taxes were very low and our income went up a lot this year, so our 2021 withholding will definitely exceed the previous year's tax. Does that mean I can avoid paying estimated tax on the IRA conversion and wait until next year's tax filing deadline with no underpayment penalty?",No,Yes,No,No,No
menoin,AlzScience,"How much do you REALLY need in emergency savings?

6 months living expenses is the rule of thumb, I'm aware. For my spouse and I that would be around $15k. However, there are a few factors that make me think that we may not need this much:

* My income is extremely stable as I'm funded for the next four years by a government-sponsored research fellowship. We are able live comfortably on my income alone and in fact this is what we do, as my spouse's income all goes toward retirement/loan payoff. We also both have side hustles that we could pretty easily ramp up if needed.
* We are renters in sudsidized university housing, which we can stay in until I finish my PhD (4 years) and has capped rent increases. So no major housing repairs or rent hikes to worry about. They're also pretty flexible about delaying rent payments in an emergency.
* We are well-insured in all areas (health, disability, pet, etc.) Only exception is car insurance where we mostly just have liability coverage, no comprehensive or collision, but that's because our car's super old and not worth much. If our car were to need replaced, our plan would be to finance a ""new"" (3-5 year old) car and cut back our retirement contributions for \~4-6 months to pay it off completely. My spouse could also bike or bus to work for a while if needed (I already bike to work as well).
* We set aside money every month into sinking funds for major planned expenses (car maintenance, insurance premiums, etc.) which is on top of our existing emergency fund.
* Our only debt is federal student loans, which are currently deferred. After September they'll be $200/mo which we can still afford if living on my income alone. The interest rate is quite low so paying minimums for a while is not a big deal.
* We have no plans for children or additional pets (we have one cat).
* We're in our 20s with no known health conditions (plus good insurance through my work with $0 deductible and $5000 out-of-pocket limit, again guaranteed for the next 4 years).
* We have around $50k invested across our 401ks, Roth IRAs, and taxable brokerage (each month we contribute around $1900). If a REALLY big emergency were to arise, we could sell our taxable portfolio (minimal capital gains tax at our current income level), take out a 401k loan, or withdraw IRA contributions.

Based on the above, it seems to me like there's really no need to keep the full $15k in our savings account when it would be better served going toward student loans or investment goals. More like $5-10k seems reasonable to me--I genuinely can't think of anything that could wipe out more than this other than some kind of apocalypse. But I'm open to being convinced otherwise--if I'm way off here, please set me straight! Am I forgetting any kinds of emergencies that we need to plan for?",Yes,Yes,No,Yes,No
mja2b8,AlzScience,"Save up separately for eventual new car? Or use emergency fund/monthly cash flow?

Our car is a 2006 Honda Pilot which we've had for around 5 years. It's had no major issues in the time that we've owned it, but we recognize that eventually it will bite the dust. The current value is around $4k so we probably would get a new car if any big repairs cost more than $2-3k. We would purchase a used car in the $8-10k range.

My question is, do we need to start saving up for a new car now? We already have $15k emergency savings. We also live on my income only and use all of my spouse's income to fund our saving and investment goals. So I figure if we needed to buy a car, we could use a chunk of our emergency savings to make a small down payment and redirect our monthly cash flow to pay it off quickly (or even just buy it in cash and use that monthly cash flow to rebuild our savings). If we temporarily redirected my spouse's income, we could pay off a car in a few months.

In my mind, it seems excessive to save up $8-10k for a new car on top of our existing $15k savings, considering our current car could easily last another 5 years. What do you all think?",No,Yes,No,Yes,No

Before I just heard people say aim to save 15-20% and was ok lez do it. Now I was wondering how does that work?

For example if someone makes gross: 100k a year gross and a net: 70k. When doing 401k contributions saving 20% is straight forward, it would be 20k in savings (not including any match). But when contributing to Roth IRA, would the percent be based off of the net 70k? Or would it be based off of the net after 401k deduction: so 100k - 20k = 80k so then 80k times .06 = 4800? So youâ€™d base the percent being contributed after deducting your 401k contributions from your gross salary (and if applicable after your HSA deduction?)

16olm6i,anotherthrowaway030,"Is there any reason to not pay off my student loans in full now that interest is accruing?

I have a little over $70,000 stashed in a HYSA and $31,000 remaining in student loans. My monthly expenses are typically around $4,000 - which includes rent, bills, groceries, eating out, discretionary spending, etc. - but I'd say $5,000 just to be extra conservative. Using this conservative number, that means that with $39,000 remaining after paying off loans, I'd have about an 8-month emergency fund saved up.

I can't see a reason to NOT pay off my loans now. My interest rate on those loans is a little above 6%, and in the three weeks of September when interest started accruing again, I've already accrued $100 in interest (which isn't a lot in the grand scheme of things, but still).

My parents are torn between waiting for potential forgiveness vs. just paying it off and not having to accrue additional interest, and they want me to save up for a down payment (in a HCOL area...).

Hi everyone, just trying to plan out my future haha.

I'm 26, no debt (just paid off all my student loans and don't carry CC debt). Currently, my savings/retirement funds look like:

* $40,000 in HYSA (which is \~8 month's worth of expenses, including any bills + discretionary money + $500/month contributions to HYSA)
* $40,000 in 401(k) - I contribute 15% of my paycheck, but company only matches 3%
* $20,000 in Roth IRA

I don't know that I have any plans to settle down any time soon, even though my parents are urging me to buy a condo (single, single income, HCOL area) sooner rather than later - as in, within the next two years. It feels nearly impossible to save up enough money for a down payment, but they have a good chunk of money saved up that they said they'd give me for the down payment.

I (24M) recently graduated and have been renting an apartment for the past year or so.

While I am incredibly grateful for their offer, I also canâ€™t help but feel that it doesnâ€™t make sense for me. Iâ€™m still young and not tied down to this area for any reason (as in, not starting a family or anything). Iâ€™m in the process of potentially switching jobs, and while I am only applying to jobs in my area, who knows what will happen in 5 years? Owning property seems like a long-term commitment (like, 10+ years).

oqx9zn,anotherthrowaway030,"Considering switching jobs that would likely require a pay cut. Is it ever worth it?

Currently hate my job - team/manager sucks, haven't really had opportunities to grow, work is mundane. Currently making around $77,000 with great benefits (free health insurance, 401(k) match), and that's without overtime. While I hate it, I also have learned to stop caring and have some free time during the day to exercise, do things around the house, etc. since I'm fully remote for now. This job is also not a permanent role - it's currently guaranteed into mid-2022 and will likely stay remote for the entire duration.

I'm interviewing for a few jobs, and that's been going well. I looked up salaries in these roles, and the range is from around $68,000 - $85,000. Not sure about benefits, but I also don't feel an urgent need super comprehensive health insurance since I'm young. Since I'm still fairly new to working (early 20s, it's been a little over a year since I graduated from college), I'd imagine I would make towards the lower end of the range. The new job would have great opportunities for professional development (free trainings, certification prep, etc. in all positions). Since this is salaried, I don't think I'll have opportunities for OT pay. I think one of the companies I feel will offer a job is looking to return to the office in the near future. This would be a permanent position. The commute isn't bad (maybe 30 minutes each way).

If I were to receive an offer, I'm wondering how much I should try to negotiate and how much I'd be okay with potentially losing in terms of regular pay. I don't like that I'm not growing, and I really cannot stand the team or the work. It really just drains my mental health, but it's not a toxic environment or anything. I do like the new role would offer opportunities for growth and the work is way more interesting, but I don't know if it's worth sacrificing the current benefits (free time, work from home).

My first job had a salary of $60,000, and I made it work with my budget. I haven't changed my lifestyle much, so scaling back wouldn't be the end of the world with my current lifestyle (have a 6-month emergency fund saved up, too).

I think taking a new role would be a great professional move since I'm not learning in my current role, but I worry that I'd be making the wrong move by potentially taking lower pay and not-as-great benefits.

q6u3af,anotherthrowaway030,"Is spending a little extra for rent worth it if my living space is a priority for me?

Hi,

I'm currently in the process of looking for a place to live. I live in a HCOL area (Los Angeles) and am hoping to stay where I am. I like the area, and my commute to work isn't too bad.

My primary job currently pays me $4,100/month, post-tax. I also picked up a part-time job for fun/extra money, which gives me an extra (at least) $500/month, although I've seen as high as $1,000/month. To be a little more cautious, I set my monthly income at $4,600 post-tax.

Currently, I budget (per month):

\- $1,200 for any shopping (groceries, fun shopping, eating out, etc.). This is an amount I've set based on my first job post-grad, and I've stuck to it. I've never really felt the need to exceed this, and I haven't had any issues sticking to this, pandemic or not.

\- $1,000 for savings ($500 emergency fund - currently have $30,000 and plan to just continue contributing $500/month, and $500 Roth IRA to max out at $6,000/year. I already contribute to my primary job's employer-sponsored 403(b) pre-tax so that I maximize the employer match, and the $4,100 is after that contribution/pre-tax deduction).

&amp;#x200B;

I don't have any debt (credit card, student loans), and my parents pay for my phone and car.

&amp;#x200B;

So, all that said, that leaves me with about $2,400. Currently, I pay $1,000 in rent. However, it's a 1 bedroom with a roommate, and we are hoping to upgrade to a 2 bedroom so we can have our own space. I have to admit my taste is a little expensive when it comes to what I want my living space to look like, so the prices I'm seeing for apartments I genuinely like would bump up my rent payment to $1,600/month (including utilities).

&amp;#x200B;

I recognize that $1,600/$4,600 puts me at around 35% of my income, which is above the 30% cap that I see a lot. That said, I don't know if it's ""acceptable"" from a financially wise standpoint to allow that excess if 1. I have the income, and would even have $800 to either save, invest, or use as a cushion for unexpected costs and 2. my living space is important to me.

&amp;#x200B;

On that note, any advice on what to do with the potentially extra $800/month I'd have? I'm thinking of investing, although I have no idea how to do that aside from my Roth IRA. I'm also thinking I could save up for trips that I'd want to take as the world slowly opens back up (fingers crossed). I don't really have pressing expensive purchases in the foreseeable future.

I'm not going to earn income above $10k this tax year, and I'm probably not going to next year. Either way under $40k which is my understanding of when long term capital gains tax starts.

I also am under the impression that long term gains require me to hold them for 1 year.

Someone knowledgeable, please tell me if my plan valid, legal, etc!

I am under the impression that stocks I held for less than 1 year are still taxable even if I pay no long term capital gains tax, so I need to hold onto those. That means I need to look at my transaction history, subtract the amount of stocks I bought in the past year from my total, sell the rest as LIFO, then buy them back ASAP, right? Also, **the year is calendar year, right? So I'd sell all stocks bought before November 11, 2019 if I did this today?**

Do brokers like Vanguard offer harvesting services so I can get back my stocks at the exact price I sold them for, maybe less the bid-ask spread? I know it doesn't really matter, but I'd still prefer not to see a .5% dip in that moment and be out more than I'd have potentially saved in taxes from harvesting.

Hi, I have lived in France for the past 3 years and will be going back to the US for a Summer internship. This is the first time I'll be in the US for an extended period of time as an adult, and I'm realizing all the expenses. I need insurance, transportation, phone, etc, and am realizing I may be looking at a higher monthly CoL than I was in France (largely due to healthcare/food/phone bills being significantly more in the US), even though I won't even be paying rent.

I'm going to be in an area where a car is pretty necessary. My mom is looking at a new car, so it may just work out that I get to use her old SUV for the few months I'm here.

Is insurance necessary? I remember when visiting for a few weeks in the past, I could take relative's vehicles out and it was *supposedly* all OK. At least, that's what I was told. I also got pulled over once and the police were OK with it. Does this extend to 4 months? I'm a very defensive driver and I'll be driving a really inexpensive, unassuming vehicle.

I may be looking to take a road trip or 2 during this time, mostly depending on COVID. Would this affect the decision? If so, how?

I've heard even as a 24 year old and with ACA, the absolute basic, highest deductible insurance can be around $300/month. That's more than half my total CoL currently.

144ki22,Areyourearsbroke,"Questions about a old 401k early withdrawal

Hi guys, I just have a real quick question about this and was wondering if anyone could shed some light. My details:

38, married with 1 kid and live in Ohio
Our home is paid off, our vehicles are paid off,
I make 41k a year(new job, just accepted), my wife makes 15k a year part time,
We had a nice nest egg of 10k, some imperative home repairs ate that up and we had to use some of our credit roughly 2k on cards. No other debt

I worked a decent paying job for 16 years, being the primary bread winner I decided to focus my income on paying off our home and vehicles wich I did. The contract on that job ran out and I ended up in a job that pays significantly less, and just recently accepted a government position at the stated income above.  The job I had was one of those rare high paying jobs that doesn't come around very often, and with my current technical degree and skill set, any other job that I qualify for pays less. I'm fine with this. I'm at a point now where I'm ok with less stress and responsibility. 

The position i just accepted details are
Salary 40,750 per year
It's a state job, great benefits + retirement
I pay the majority of the bills, added up I'm at 1600 per month. 

So the original question, would it be worth doing an early withdrawal of say 3k from my old 401k, paying off this newly accrued credit card debt so I can start with a clean slate as to start building my emergency fund back up?

The 401k has 55k in currently. I plan to roll this into the government pension plan I just became a member of. At the same time, I would like to start this job in a complete saving situation and would not like to have to worry about chipping away at credit card debt.  I understand there are penalties involved, I just wanted to get some feedback on whether or this group thought it would be a reasonable option?

Bad news is I had to bust into most of my emergency fund and take a loan out on my 401k to take care of a major foundation repair to my home. It pretty much wiped out my emergency fund.

Anyways, the good news is that I got a $5000 dollar per year raise at work. I decided to take the addition money each paycheck and have it deposited into my savings account each pay to build my emergency fund back up. It increased my current liquid savings contribution from $200 a month to $500 a month. I also have a joint savings with my wife that i contribute an additional $200 a month. Its for our kid though. My question is, after I have my emergency fund back in shape, roughly around September, should I lower what I put into my savings and increase my 401k contribution? I like the idea of having I bigger liquid savings account but I understand the importance of having propper retirement savings. I'm already behind on my retirement savings. I have 2 years left on my vehicle (400 a month) and was planning on trying to get as close to max on my 401k contribution as possible once it is paid for.

Hey guys, my step son has come into some inheritance the last few weeks and I have some questions I was wondering if anyone on this sub would be able to answer. 

- My stepsons paternal grandparents passed away within 3 weeks of each other last month. Due to being estranged from his father, they left every thing to him. 

- They left him everything as far as I can tell. They both had individual wills that declared everything be left to him in the event that they passed. He has seen a lawyer about it and this has been verified. He has another meeting with the lawyer next week.

- We did some digging and found that they have roughly 60k in savings, but also found that they pulled a equity line of credit for roughly 100k out on thier house. The current value on the house is roughly 300k. The house was/is paid off aside from the equity line.

- They had a few credit cards that have all been forgiven already

- He has transfered all the utilities into his name. The lawyer said to keep paying them but not to pay on any lines of credit 

- His grandfather passed first of heart failure, then his grandmother passed of the same thing in the samespot in the house believe it or not, exactly 3 weeks later. So we don't have all the info yet on any kind of retirement or brokerage accounts they may have had, or life insurance. 

- My wife and I paid the cremation cost of both grandparents, it cost us roughly 1800 dollars, yeah his dad is a real piece of work. He's going to pay us back though. 


1. Will he be responsible for the home equity line of credit?

2. How do we go about finding any kind of retirement savings they may have had? Life insurance? He can't seem to find any documentation on it.

If average Joe is saving $500 a month X 12, he is saving $6000 a year. Which means 30 year old Joe will have saved $6000X(67-30)= **$220,000 when he is 67 years old as suggested** .

I am very new to investing and just from what I am reading the numbers seem to be too good to true. Seems like with SP500 on average you can expect a return of 8-9%. This means if I moved my father's 5 mm in company stock to SP500 I would expect close to a 450-500K return annually on ""UP"" years?

Its easy to look back at the past 40 years and see that this strategy would not have as high of a yield as remaining invested in equities.

This was mostly caused by the monetization of the U.S. Economy that started in the 70s with going off the gold standard. (Printing of Money) and interest rates that have been on a steady decline until now.

As you can see what happened in the market last year for example. I think there is a paradigm shift in play right now where I think equities in particular will not do as well as they have the past 4 decades.

1st If you go further back there where times where high inflation occurred most people today hold no gold. High inflation leads to decreased profits for various reasons. Companies can not just run deficits and be financed with cheap money. I think this is going to force the economy back into a real economy. You physically will have to produce something to prosper. In this type of economy Commodities and gold should do well. (Commodity futures/Gold ETF in this case...)

2nd there will be times of deflation in these cases Bonds/cash will do well which is covered in the commodities DBC ticker as well since most is held in cash and bonds with 25% in commodities or you can choose to hold additional bonds.

3rd There will be volatility, You will see as more people continue to move to passive investments you will get huge swings from day to day. a Volatility component will profit from this unpredictability. 5 out of 10 of the largest swings going back to the 1890s have occurred in the last 4 years.... This is my attempt to hedge and survive any market condition I might face. Will it yield the most? Only time will tell....

I will rebalance annually and might tweak a position here or there or add bonds if necessary at some point. But there is no where for bonds to go but down at this point in my estimation....

Please let me know your honest thoughts. I know this goes against what most have been doing the past 12 years where we have seen an awesome equites bull run that has mostly since 2008 been financed by printing money and keeping interest rates low.

17tp579,Avionics_Engineer06,"Should I sell or keep my vehicle?

I purchased a 2023 Pacifica Hybrid earlier this year for approx. $52K. I traded in and put money down suffice it to say my current balance is $25,800.

When I purchased the car we needed two vehicles due to my work situation etc. Since then I was hired at a new job (Long term Government Contract) in which I am 100% remote.

We have 4 children so we do need a third row when we go out as a complete family. Vans seem to fit that niche well.

My wife's vehicle is a 2013 Dodge Grand Caravan with \~165000K no spring chicken for sure.

Here is my current situation. I make $236K per year. My debts are as follows:

1. 25.8K @ 5.48% The remainder of the loan on the Pacifica
2. 43K @ 8.49% Basement renovation (Added two conforming bedrooms to the basement)/New HVAC and generator.
3. Mortgage 300K @ 2.35% 

No other debts....

I know with my income I could knock out the car loan in a few months and be done with it, but would still have the full 43K to go on the other. (I would most likely have already been done with the car loan if it wasn't for me bankrolling a lot of the home improvements with cash.) We put about 70K into the house this past summer.

 It's the psychological aspect that is keeping me up and night. I despise debt but here I am found myself back into it this year.

Am I overthinking this should I just hunker down and get it paid off ASAP?

Carvana has offered me 47K to buy it from me that could take care of this loan and half the other loan but then I still have an old van but I might have some time to save up a considerable amount of cash to buy one outright with cash next time

I also shopped around local dealers they were looking to pay in the 40K range and I wasn't looking to take that haircut...

I have a 6-month emergency fund that I would prefer not to touch at all if that makes sense.

What would you all do if you were in my shoes? Had this debate with my wife we both know we will be fine either way I am the more emotional person when it comes to finances....

Hell community!

I  somewhat follow Dave Ramsey's advice on investing and I want to see what the general consensus in the community is as far as allocation of my investments go or if you think there are better alternatives.

I am 33 years old and plan to retire at 65, I am married with 4 children, wife works as a mother in our home.

First I invest 15% of my gross 145K in retirement

8% goes into my Roth 401K to get a match from my company which is 9% (Pre-Tax)  of my base pay for a total of 17%

The fund choices are fairly limited in the 401K but this is what I have picked 25% allocation to each:

 [Balanced Index Fund](https://doc.morningstar.com/latestdoc.aspx?clientid=xerox&amp;key=712353eab3340838&amp;documenttype=52&amp;sourceid=213&amp;investmentid=SPUSA050BQ) 

[S&amp;P 500 Index Fund](https://doc.morningstar.com/latestdoc.aspx?clientid=xerox&amp;key=712353eab3340838&amp;documenttype=52&amp;sourceid=213&amp;investmentid=SPUSA050BR) 

[International Index Fund](https://doc.morningstar.com/latestdoc.aspx?clientid=xerox&amp;key=712353eab3340838&amp;documenttype=52&amp;sourceid=213&amp;investmentid=SPUSA050BV) 

[Russell 2000 Index Fund](https://doc.morningstar.com/latestdoc.aspx?clientid=xerox&amp;key=712353eab3340838&amp;documenttype=52&amp;sourceid=213&amp;investmentid=SPUSA050BX)  

The other 7% goes into a Vanguard Roth IRA where I am invested in the the following 4 founds 25% allocation each:

 [Vanguard 500 Index Fund Admiral SharesÂ ](https://personal.vanguard.com/us/XHTML/com/vanguard/retail/web/holdingdetail/view/HoldingDetail.xhtml?hldId=432906129123637&amp;Ticker=VFIAX&amp;AcctId=767819114124923) 

 [Vanguard Mid-Cap Index Fund Admiral SharesÂ ](https://personal.vanguard.com/us/XHTML/com/vanguard/retail/web/holdingdetail/view/HoldingDetail.xhtml?hldId=725745129123637&amp;Ticker=VIMAX&amp;AcctId=767819114124923) 

 [Vanguard Small-Cap Index Fund Admiral SharesÂ ](https://personal.vanguard.com/us/XHTML/com/vanguard/retail/web/holdingdetail/view/HoldingDetail.xhtml?hldId=638838129123637&amp;Ticker=VSMAX&amp;AcctId=767819114124923) 

 [Vanguard Total International Stock Index Fund Admiral SharesÂ ](https://personal.vanguard.com/us/XHTML/com/vanguard/retail/web/holdingdetail/view/HoldingDetail.xhtml?hldId=893984129123637&amp;Ticker=VTIAX&amp;AcctId=767819114124923) 

I have about 120K in total retirement funds, since I just started at this new company that 401k is just starting the rest has been rolled over from my previous company to Vanguard Roth/Traditional IRA accounts.

I also found that my new company has many restrictions on rolling the 401K over to IRAs such as withholding company matches for a period of time so I will not be touching that money.

I also have a standard after tax vanguard brokerage account with the same funds as above, where I put anything extra I have a month in after paying my bills and and funding my retirement. This is on top of my 6 month emergency fund.

Do you feel that my allocation is correct for my age and to maximize my returns to be able to retire at a reasonable age? Is 120K at my age enough to meet my goals?  I have always contributed to my 401K since my late teens but I am really starting to be serious about investing. Also bear in mind I was not making this salary before, I only made about 60K 5 years ago, I ended at 84K then jumped to this new company where I am now making 145K. I am wondering what your thoughts and assessments are of my plan and allocations and fund choices.

Any thoughts or suggestions would be much appreciated!",Yes,Yes,No,Yes,No
