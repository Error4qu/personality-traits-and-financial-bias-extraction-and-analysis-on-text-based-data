Just opened a Roth IRA. Iâ€™m looking to purchase 60% VTI and 40% VXUS. Iâ€™ve had other reddits users tell me to just use VT at a higher expense rate and that it rebalances for me.

10a10um,WorldCupCup,"How does maxing out Roth IRA for 2022 work?

Hi everyone, I just opened an IRA last week and was hoping to max out my contribution for 2023. Iâ€™ve learned that I am still able to max out my 2022 contribution until I file my taxes. Iâ€™ve never put money into an IRA before so I was wondering how this works. Is there an option to differentiate which year my deposit counts towards? Or is it automatically going to go towards 2022 until I file my taxes and then it starts going towards 2023? Iâ€™m hoping to dump $6k for 2022 and then make biweekly payments of $250 to max out for 2023, I wish I could dump another 6.5k at once for 2023 but I unfortunately canâ€™t.",Yes,Yes,Yes,No,No
10eozyb,WorldCupCup,"How does allocation within an ETF work?

I have a target date fund for my 401k and recently bought into VT for my Roth IRA. I went with VT because I know it will automatically readjust the US/World stock ratio. From what I recall, when I first bought in last week the composition was about 60% Domestic to 40% foreign which makes sense with 0% bond and 0% short term. Now when I check the composition it shows 29% Domestic to 20% foreign with 50% short term. If anyone can please answer the following questions Iâ€™d really appreciate it!

I just opened a Roth IRA and put 6k in for 2022 and will max out for 2023 eventually. I was initially going to buy VTI for all domestic stock but decided to go with VT to diversify further after hearing other redditors suggestions on this subreddit. Because I will only put in about 1/4 of the amount I will put into my 401k I wanted to allocate that 12% in bonds to stock as well which is why I didnâ€™t go for a target date fund for my IRA. My questions are: 

Is it a bad idea to not have all your accounts (401k/IRA) in the same stock/ETF?

Has anyone done the actual math on returns if one sticks with 100% stock or 88% stock/12%bonds? Iâ€™ve been told many times that 12% wonâ€™t have a significant difference but it would be great to know how much of a difference it would generate with actual numbers.",Yes,Yes,No,Yes,No
zi61y5,WorldCupCup,"Does Roth 401k earn compounding interest?

Iâ€™ve seen online that 401kâ€™s are a smart choice as it earns compounding interest either monthly, quarterly, semi-annually, or annually.

Iâ€™m looking to increase my contribution per barge from 6% to 10% and also open a Roth IRA where I contribute monthly.

ky1mhd,WuMedic,"Changing Filing Taxes from Accrual Method to Cash Method

So in July of 2019, I started a consulting company, single member LLC.  Most of my contracts are paid on a 1099 for my time.  Knowing that I was going to have a large contract coming in January 2020, with a large bonus that was all but guaranteed due to how well things were going, I decided to file using accrual method for 2019 to minimize the amount of taxes I would pay in 2020 since often times I get paid 1-2 months after I bill out for services.

Fast forward to 2020.  I not only had the large bonus, but several other contracts that came to fruition, but between filing taxes for 2019 and now working on this year's taxes, I'm thinking I made a mistake.  I should have filed using cash method since right now, the 1099's never match up with my annual income and there is no way to ""check my math"" so to speak.

At this point, would it be worth changing from accrual method to cash method?  If so, how complex is the process.  I have not hired a CPA just yet as I've been wanting to learn the business end of things on my own (my parents are both accountants though they have both been out of the game for years after retiring but can answer some simple questions for me) and feel I get a better idea of what is going on with my money flow when I do it myself and how to optimize taxes, etc so I was hoping to not have to hire a CPA for a few more years still...  Can I make this change myself?  Would it be easier to do with an effective date of 1/1/2021 to make it so I don't have a year partially in accrual method and cash method?

ljdjhv,WuMedic,"What Tax Forms to Expect from Brokerage and other Equities Holdings? (x-post r/tax)

Tl;DR:  I was an idiot and invested in things I didn't fully understand.  Made a  lot of decent money, but don't understand any of the tax implications of it, or even when I will get my tax forms.

So I graduated from residency in 2019 and in 2020 I started managing my own brokerage accounts as I became self employed (in 2019).  Previously I had a 403(b) through the hospital and no extra disposable income to invest.

Now I have a SEP-IRA and  couple of brokerage accounts.  In 2020, I had no idea what I was doing  and made some really poor choices.  I ended up getting really lucky and  making a decent amount of money (in my dad's words, it was sheer beginners luck that I decided to start investing when I did -- I was getting ready to file taxes and therefore made my 2019 IRA contribution as well as opened up my taxable brokerage accounts literally at the dip of the spring stock market crash).

I'm more on the right path now, and have most of my holdings in boring index funds, but I understand that each stock I bought and sold will be taxed at my ordinary income rate of 35%.  I also bought some investments  I didn't really understand (REITs, LPs, Futures, etc) that I now understand won't just show up on a 1099 brokerage tax statement.  I am still holding onto some of these.

Schwab tells me that my 1099-b will be ready on Feb 19th, but my dad says that  I will have a lot of other forms that may come directly from the stocks/funds/commodities/etc I invest/invested in (he mentioned a K-1)  and they often come very late in the tax season.  Is there any way to know what forms to expect and when I'm ""done"" receiving forms and can file my taxes?

lu2vt4,WuMedic,"Does Making an Auto Insurance Claim Cause Your Rates to Go Up Regardless of Fault?

I was reading the thread that was pretty popular yesterday or the day before about someone getting dropped from homeowners insurance for making multiple claims and I was wondering if that was the case with auto insurance as well?

I drive many miles to get to and from work (100-150 miles round trip) so it's unsurprising that over the years I've gotten into a few accidents.  (I'm also a member of a volunteer fire department, so we take a driving class every year, but even watching out for other people's mistakes, there's only so much you can do to avoid an accident sometimes!)  I had one at fault accident 14+ years ago, but never had another at fault accident since then.  I have had a few non-at fault incidents though (parked car backed into by someone I knew who let me know, parked car involved in a hit and run caught on camera-owner found with police help, car side swiped by a semi on a highway, car pulled out against a red light in front of me, rear-ended by a car on a freeway as I slowed down to avoid debris, side swiped by a pickup who failed to check his blind spot changing lanes).

However, when I do get into an accident, I've never contacted my own insurance company, and just work with the other person's insurance company directly so my insurance company won't find out about it.  The other day, a friend of mine got me thinking as he rode in my car for the first time and saw my dashcam setup.  I had mentioned that it makes claims when someone else is at fault really easy--I told him I send the other guy's insurance company the video footage and the discussion quickly goes from ""are you sure he's at fault, let's wait for all of the police paperwork"" to ""OK, how much is the damage and where do you want the check sent?""

His response was: ""Why are you working with the other guy's insurance? Submit your claim to your own insurance and let them sort it out with the other guy's insurance!  That's what you're paying them for!""

So I guess my questions are these:

1. If I am not at fault, will submitting the claim through my own insurance cause my rates to go up?
2. If I submit the claim through my own insurance, will I have to pay my deductible and any not covered expenses (rental car, missed work) out of pocket?  Or do they go after the other party for the full amount?

m1yi29,WuMedic,"Aggregate Contribution Limits for 401(k), 403(b) and IRA

So I am having a bit of difficulty figuring out how much I can contribute to each.

In 2020, I had a 403(b) through a part time job, and a SEP-IRA through my consulting business.  I was under the impression that the contribution limits were separate.  I could have $57,000 towards my SEP and \~$19,000 for my 403 (b) (not sure what the hard max was for the 403(b) because my employer only matched up to 4% so that's what I elected.

in 2021, I will still have the SEP-IRA and 403(b), but I will pick up a second part time job that has a 401(k) option.  However, I was told during orientation to be careful about this as apparently most part time casual places do not offer 401(k)'s for their employees, but since this one does, they have run into issues with hitting aggregate limits for people with multiple jobs.  I am wondering what exactly these aggregate limits are.

m7ens1,WuMedic,"How to Find a Tax Advisor/CPA (x-post r/tax)

TL;DR - I have a plan outlined below for filing my very complicated taxes this year.  Is it a good one?  Also, how do I find a CPA/Tax person who can do what I need them to do/who I know I can trust?

So in 2019 I finished my medical residency program and now work a variety of jobs.  I have an LLC which all of my self-employment consulting income goes through, a couple of W-2 jobs (Direct patient care), and some investments.  My 2019 taxes were a bit complicated, but I was able to import most things through quickbooks.  I had a couple of W-2's to input but I did not have to input any 1099's due to me filing on accrual basis (more on this later).  I decided to learn everything on my own for my own knowledge, plus it helped me identify how I might be able to change how I do some things in order to try and save on taxes.

In 2020, I started some investment accounts and this is where things get wonky.  This year, I have in addition to my W-2 and 1099's/business income, a ""combined"" statement from Schwab with my 1099-B, 1099-INT, and 1099-DIV.  I also have at least 2 K-1's one of which has something about contracts and straddles, and another one which seems to have 3 nested K-1's ""Supplemental K-1 Information statement for tax year 2020""  While last year was quite a bit for me to learn about taxes, this year, it seems like an insurmountable obstacle and I have spent way more time than I should have working on my taxes.  I did it myself last year to try and learn things own my own, but I'm not sure any of the knowledge I would gain from figuring this out own my own is worth the extra time I'm sinking into this.

&amp;#x200B;

To recap, I have:

\- 3 W-2's- Business income, single member LLC from Quickbooks import (4 1099-NEC's but I don't use them since I file under accrual basis)- A handful of 1099-INTs from savings accounts- A combined 1099-B/DIV/INT from my brokerage account- A 1099-G for unemployment income (3 weeks worth when a bunch of us were furloughed at the beginning of the pandemic)- A K-1 that's relatively straightforward- A K-1 that's not straightforward and has a ""Supplemental K-1 Information statement"" that appears to have 3 nested K-1's- Maybe other K-1's that I'm not even aware of yet

My plan is to:

\- File an extension myself to give myself until October 15th to figure all of this out- On April 15th, pay the amount that Turbo Tax says I owe, knowing this is likely an estimate because the likelihood of me inputting everything correctly, especially the investment stuff is pretty close to 0.- Hire a CPA/Tax Preparer to review my tax filings (or if it's easier just start from scratch) sometime after April 15th (I don't want them to feel rushed since I now have less than a month to file, plus I want to take my time in finding someone)- Ask that same person to file the paperwork to change my filing basis from accrual to cash.  This way, my 1099's line up with my business income.  (I had initially filed accrual basis as the first year I started halfway through the year and I wanted to get December's income onto a year with a lower tax bracket.)- Discuss with that same person strategies to decrease tax liability going forward

My questions for Reddit:

1. How do I find someone to do all of this for me?  Is it like finding a lawyer or insurance agent where I just ask around/google around and then interview a few people until I find someone I feel comfortable with?  I'm guessing this has passed the point of walk down to wal-mart or a H&amp;R Block storefront and hand over my forms... I thought about doing this turbotax live thing to upgrade from my current Turbotax version, but I'm not even sure that would be sufficient...
2. Is my plan a good one where I pay my estimated taxes owed for 2020 on April 15th and then give myself 6 months to figure everything else out?
3. How much would you expect these services to cost me?

Thanks for any advice guys!",Yes,Yes,No,Yes,Yes
mfwt92,WuMedic,"How to Manage Funding of a 401(k) and a 403(b)

So my main job is largely self employed, and I contribute the max to a SEP-IRA (something like $56k per year).

I have a casual position (W-2 employee) with a non-profit that has a 403(b) plan.  They match 50% up to 4% (or something like that) so I put 4% in each paycheck and the get the 2% match with immediate vesting.  Since I can go for months without working for them (their busy season is usually October through March), I just put in the minimum 4% to get the match, and the amount fluctuates throughout the year.

I am now starting another casual employed position (also W-2) with a corporation that has no match for casual employees, but we can still contribute to a 401(k) with pretax deferral elections.

I am not sure how to proceed here.  I have enough income that I won't miss 19.5k from my income and I think it makes sense at my tax bracket to take advantage of the tax advantages with the 401(k) deferral (upper end of 35% marginal tax rate), but I don't wanna max out my 401(k) since it limits the amount I can contribute to my 403(b) which has a match.  For example, if I have already put $1,500 into the 403(b) in the beginning of the year, and I put $1k in per week for 18 weeks over the summer, when I'm back in the fall to my non-profit job, I will now have 2 problems--over-contribution, and I won't be able to get my 50% match.

What's the best way to go about managing this?  Any suggestions are welcome!",Yes,Yes,No,Yes,No

Obviously there are risks as with every investment and it seems that about 10-20% either don't make significant gains on the first day or actually lose value.  However, my research does not show at what point do things ""peak"" during all of this volatility.

oy0sau,WuMedic,"How to Separate From ""Financial Advisor"" without losing insurance?

TL;DR - I have a disability insurance policy with a ""financial advisor"" who I no longer enjoy working with and who seems better suited for selling used cars.  Can I leave him to find someone else without losing my policy?  Also, why does my policy list someone else's name under ""your financial representative""?

So prior to leaving medical school and again prior to leaving residency, we had exit counseling sessions about financial planning and life planning in general.  Half of it was basics that you get from a high school personal finance class, but the other half was more advanced stuff related to student loans, investments, and contingency planning.  (Retirement accounts, brokerage accounts, malpractice insurance, life insurance, disability insurance, living wills, powers of attorney, etc.)  We were all encouraged to get disability insurance (and life insurance for those of us with dependents) at a minimum and there were a list of brokers our attendings use and like as well as a list of people recently graduated residents used and liked.

Fortunately, the sessions were pretty comprehensive so it meant that when I went shopping for DI and LI, it was pretty easy to comparison shop.  There are also only 5 companies that have DI for physicians with own-occupation, same-specialty protection so it was easy to price shop.  I requested quotes from all 5 companies from a few different brokers people had good experience with in the past, and setup a meeting with the cheapest.  This is probably where I went wrong.  The cheapest only had one person who recommended him whereas the others had multiple others who had used him.

When I went to the meeting with him, he was very professional and pushed a 6th option I was as of then, unaware of.  Turns out, the company he is an affiliate of, Northwest Mutual, has it's own DI which he said was comparable to the other 5 I was looking at and would be cheaper for me.  He assured me that I could go with any of the other 5 and he would be happy to help if I didn't choose NWM's DI, but he had a lot of knowledge of this product since it was his company's own product.  I asked him to send me the plan documents to review and he had already had them prepared and handed me a packet.  After a thorough reading and some research online, it was own-occ, but not own specialty so not nearly as good as the other 5.  I declined and chose one of the other 5 companies. 

Fast forward a few months, and he was having a lot of trouble getting the policy written.  I had my health exams and such so I was just waiting on him to ""do some paperwork"" but it ended up taking a long time.  From time to time, he would offer to try to get me in with NWM's own DI policy.  I had suspected that he was just stringing me along, but someone stated they didn't think so--either way, he was going to make a commission, so why jeopardize it by trying to get me into a different product for just slightly more commission when I could just walk to a competitor.  He would also try to gauge my interest in some of the other products he wanted to set-up for me (I had also inquired about life insurance, malpractice services, retirement and brokerage accounts etc) but I was getting frustrated and I didn't want to proceed with anything else until we could get at least one thing done.

At this point, I branched out.  While it would have been nice to keep everything in one place, I was worried this guy was incompetent.  I comparison shopped for life insurance, brokerage accounts, retirement accounts, and a couple of other things.  I ended up going with one broker for LI, and went with Schwab for both retirement and brokerage accounts.  I went with yet another party for risk management/malpractice services.

At the 6 month mark, he finally had a policy for me to review.  Turns out, I had a medical condition I didn't know about which made my premiums higher than originally quoted.  I was told they would reconsider at the 2 year mark.  I don't think any of the quotes were bait-and-switch.  I have since looked at repricing the DI, and the quotes I'm getting are still similar across the board.  Other than that, it was pretty straightforward, sign on the dotted line, and off I went.  He wanted to chat more about the other products we had originally discussed, but I was tired of dealing with him so I asked him not to follow-up until it was time for renewal.

Fast forward to the one year mark, and we sit down for another chat.  I renew my DI and he has prepared a whole powerpoint presentation for life insurance, retirement accounts, risk management, and a few things we hadn't even discussed.  Once again, very professionally done, but I informed him that I had already chosen other firms for pretty much everything we talked about the first meeting and I didn't see the need for some of the extra products he was selling me.  He seemed kind of irked and flustered and started going off script.  At one point he tries to tell me that while I currently have term life insurance, I really need whole life insurance too.  This was red flag number 1.  While I don't post here often, I do read this sub occasionally, and I knew I didn't need whole life.  He then went on about how I could setup a brokerage account with them with part of my assets for more aggressive growth and how their active management consistently beats the market--red flag number 2.  I know when I'm being taken for a ride and I asked to sign the DI policy and to leave.  I also asked if he was a fiduciary and he gave a cryptic answer--they have fiduciary services, and he can be a fiduciary, once my AUM hits a certain number (I think it was 500k?).  Red flag number 3.   He seemed to turn from a friendly guy into a high pressure used car salesman in the span of about 5 minutes, not wanting to let me ""walk off the lot without any add-ons"" so to speak.  I informed him that I didn't have many days when I wasn't seeing patients and I had other meetings to get to with my other vendors so he reluctantly let me sign the policy, and I cut him a check.

That was a year ago next month.  I am not looking forward to meeting with this guy again.  I have noticed that on my renewal paperwork that just came in the mail (and looking back, the initial policy issue and first renewal) that my financial advisor's name is nowhere on it.  Instead of the guy I work with ""John Smith"" (made up names) it instead says:

Your Financial representative: Mark Brown, CFP, CLU (followed by an address not even in the same city as me, but about 1.5 hours away).

Can I just go deal with Mark and not work with John anymore without having to get a new policy and go through the health check again?  Or maybe, since they said they would reconsider at the 2 year mark, it would make sense to go shopping again?

pflmhy,WuMedic,"How does 0% intro APR on a credit card work?

So this is probably an embarrassingly newbie question, but my parents and high school personal finance class always stressed not ever carrying a balance on a credit card unless it was as a last resort.  So I have no clue how financing on a credit card works.

Recently, I got a piece of mail from Capital One (whom I have a business credit card through, but not a personal one) regarding an offer.  Terms are (among other things I don't think are relevant):

* 0% intro APR on purchases and balance transfers for the first 15 months with a 15.49%-25.49% variable APR after that.  There is a 3% fee for amounts transferred for the first 15 months.
* a $200 one-time cash bonus when you spend $500 on purchases within 3 months of your account opening
* $0 annual fee
* Unlimited 1.5% cash back on every purchase, every day
* Cash Back that won't expire for the life of your account

I have to pay estimated taxes due to being self employed and they are on the order of the low 5 figure range each quarter.  I'm thinking of opening this credit card and requesting a credit limit of at least the amount due for September 15th estimated taxes.  I see these benefits:

* I get a $200 cash bonus which more than covers the fee for paying taxes with a credit card
* I get 1.5% of my taxes as cash back (so on low 5 figures, a few hundred dollars extra)
* Potentially not having to pay any interest for 15 months so until the end of 2022

I've read on PF though that I just need to make sure I pay off the whole amount before the 15 months is up or otherwise the interest accrues from day 1.  Also, it may hurt my credit utilization ratio a bit, but I currently have a mortgage with no plans on moving anytime soon and a paid off car so no plans to use credit any time soon.  My understanding is that even if my car dies tomorrow, I'm forced to move for some reason, or I need access to credit, credit utilization doesn't have a memory so I just pay off the card and my utilization ratio goes back down to zero. **Any other pitfalls I need to watch out for?**  

There's no such thing as a free lunch, so I'm just trying to see what I'm missing--why would capital one want to give me free money for 15 months?  The only thing I can think of is if they are monitoring my credit usage, they can see that with my business credit card through another bank, I routinely spend $10k-$20k per month and maybe they are trying to get a piece of that pie?

I'm currently in a really shitty situation with very little resources.

Dad is financially abusive, controls my mom's money and my brother's money. He wants me to move home and work for him. That's the only way he'll support me. I don't want to work for him because he's.... abusive.... I wouldn't be an employee, so he'd just pay me with room and food. That's it. If I live at home and work for him, I'd have to get a job that he wants me to have. I have no car, I drive his car. I'm not allowed to drive to my job that's 70 miles away. He wants me to get a local job, aka something maybe 4 or 5 miles away. We live in the country suburbs... so I could work at Bojangles or Food Lion or something of that nature. He expects me to pay back $1000's of dollars of money but won't tell me how much I owe him but withholds help unless I pay him whenever he asks me. I have a lot of medical expenses, like I just had a surgery last year and I also have a tumor in my head. 

Working from home is not reliable because my dad does not respect boundaries and believes that everything needs to be his way or he'll call the police. I've physically fought my dad... he's tried to push me down the stairs when I was still in high school. He will fight my mom and my brother, too.

My closest friends are either similarly abusive or they're not in the place to help anyone. 

I received a 10 day pay or quit notice from my apartment on 03/03/2022... I owe over $3000 in rent. I'm only making $23/hour. I have two bank accounts: one is an online banking account and the other is a credit union account that I share with my mom (who's under my dad's financial abuse) and I also owe the credit union $14k so they take any money that stays in my checking account for more than a day or two. 

I just started this job, and I don't get paid until Friday, but it's a physical check being mailed out to me. It's currently being sent to my apartment, but I might not have access to that apartment later this month. I'd get it sent to my house, but my dad takes my mail and hides it.

Here are my updates:

- Lost the $23/hour job. Didnâ€™t have enough gas to drive 80 miles to work, had a doctor appointment during work, and was running on 4 hours of sleep a night for 3 days. Called my boss to explain the situation. He told me to go to the doctors appointment and that he was going to pay for me a few gallons of gas to get to appointment. I took a nap in my car while I waited for the appointment. Went to the appointment, went to get gas, the staffing company called to say I was fired. 

- I got my paycheck of $327.21 the day after I was fired. Brought food, paid my past due water bill, brought gas for the car Iâ€™m borrowing, brought some stuff at Walmart and Ulta. $15 left from that paycheck. 

- Called my old 401k company. Had $2700 in there, requested a full withdraw from the 401k. Got a $1700 check. Paid for my past due storage unit and food. I have $1300 left. 

- Surrendered my two cats to the city APS

- Posted on social media that l needed somewhere to stay. 

- Applied for food stamps. 

So I still need to rent a uhaul to move my furniture out of my apartment and into my storage unit. 

I found two possible roommates that I know of. 

Option A: Wants to live in the more expensive cities that are not around my current job, but willing to equally split rent and utilities. Looking to rent a 2 bed.  

Option B: Willing to live wherever, but only wants to contribute an unknown partial amount of rent and utilities because heâ€™s not going to be home very often due to work. Looking to rent a 1 bed. 

Iâ€™m expecting to earn another $200 this month through work. 

I struggle to keep full time employment. 30 hours a week is pushing my limit. Working before 10 am pushes my limit as well as working consecutive days. 

Still looking for a job that can accommodate my needs. The flexible jobs near me start at $10/hr for part time work. 

The food stamps case worker requested my February pay stubs. My net pay was $186.26 for the month of February.

I told my boss that I could work tomorrow but now Iâ€™m feeling sick with a sore throat, stuffy and runny nose. My friend is supposed to help me move my things out tomorrow morning before work. Financially I need to go to work but Iâ€™m not feeling well.

* *Pay income earning expenses.* The $60 in gas includes getting me to and from work this month. 

* *Pay health insurance and health care expenses.* My health insurance premium is $8.44. My current group therapy isn't covered by insurance, so that's $300/month out of pocket until I find a dbt skills group that accepts my insurance.

hk1qj3,xyeLz,"401k vs. IRA vs. Intelligent Portfolio vs. Brokerage

Hi all,

I am *not* financially savvy nor do I pretend to be; however, a few years ago I installed Robinhood and began using it to select individual stock investments. I made some lucky decisions and get in early on a few stocks with a little bit of money. I haven't made a ton, but I'm happy with my returns so far.

That being said, I've been doing a lot of online research lately. It seems the general consensus that the Robinhood business model is a little ""shady"" (I didn't say this myself, but I trust the community) and that there are better investment platforms out there. I've had a Vanguard and Fidelity account for the longest time and still do for some minor investments; however, I have transferred all of my Robinhood funds and a lot of my other funds to Schwab. So far, I'm loving the experience. That being said, there's an overwhelming amount of information at Schwab that prompted me to do further research, which made me wonder whether I'm doing everything correctly.

Right now, I contribute a little bit to my 401k (about $300/mo). My employer doesn't match, but they dump in a percentage of our salary at the end of the year regardless of what I put in. I've continued to add a little every month just to supplement this. However, I'm several thousand dollars off the tax bracket and don't anticipate using my 401k to lower my tax bracket anytime soon. That being said, I see conflicting theories all the time as to whether I should max out my 401k *before* investing elsewhere, or not. At the moment, I've been picking and choosing individual stocks and have been doing quite well (crossing my fingers for the future). I also began investing IRAs (Roth vs. traditional). Recently, I signed my wife and myself up for an Intelligent Portfolio at Schwab with the intention that we will both contribute regularly to this in an effort to grow our ""future together fund"", something like $400-600 per month between the two of us. Since we've been married, she's never liked the fact that we don't have a joint account, so I thought this would be a great way to consolidate *some* of our funds while growing them simultaneously.

That being said, I'm still really torn where to go personally. Should I be contributing a lot more to my 401k? Should I open an IRA and contribute here instead? Why or why not? Or should I continue to invest in individual stocks within my brokerage? I recently sold most of my Vanguard ETFs because the returns on the stocks were just too appetizing (and continue to pay off, but this may come crashing down depending on what happens with COVID). I love the thought of investing heavily and taking a ton of risk for big gains. I actually did a lot of crypto investing during the boom a few years ago - this unfortunately did not end well for me, but that's how you learn.

hngkcl,xyeLz,"Question about IRAs and 401ks

Hi all,

I read the sidebar about how to allocate my investments and I've got a few questions surrounding IRAs:

1. If I want to sign up for a traditional IRA, do I need to make sure my company supports this? I'm not sure how the ""pre-tax"" money will get deposited.
2. Between a traditional IRA and a Roth IRA is the annual maximum for both *combined* 6k or is it 6k for each of them?
3. Likewise, my employer offers both a traditional and Roth 401k; is this 19.5k *combined* between the 2 of them or 19.5k for each?

I am thinking of switching out of my (no-match) Roth 401k and am trying to decide whether to open a traditional or Roth IRA.

I was leaning towards the Roth IRA simply because I like having my money taxed now (not a big fan of the unknown) but I am also trying to figure out what to do for my wife who is a teacher at a private school and doesn't make much. What would make the most sense in this case? Should I contribute fully to a Roth IRA or should I split it (such as 4k to the Roth and 2k to a traditional IRA)?

I am not sure how far that extends; for example, if an employee contributes 100% to their 401k, I am not sure if the employer continues to match 4% or not. My question, however, is whether contributing 5% to get the match is even worth it given the fees and inflexibility that exists with a 401k.

hz0na3,xyeLz,"Should I dispute this charge or am I being petty?

Hi all,

I purchased some sheets from a seemingly reputable company about 6 weeks ago. In my initial email explanation to them of what I was looking for, I have in writing that I explicitly asked for ""flat sheets that I could use as my fitted sheet"" and that ""the manufacturer explained this as ordering fitted sheets without the elastic"". When I spoke on the phone with the vendor, they informed me that they knew what I was talking about. We discussed some technical details, and I informed them that it was odd that they were asking for a ""depth"" since all I wanted was a flat sheet. Since this was on the phone, it is obviously not available, but it sounds like there was a misunderstanding. The entire order was almost $700.

I recently received my first delivery and the sheets were incorrect. They contained an elastic, so the company is allowing me to ship back the sheets (obviously) for a full refund.

However, when I received the second delivery, it wasn't what I had intended. I received the sheets but they are essentially a fitted sheet without an elastic. I realize that this is what pretty much the manufacturer provided me, which is what I had informed the vendor, but it is also *not* what I had asked for. I had explicitly asked for a *flat* sheet to act as a fitted sheet. This was my first time ordering sheets, and when I spoke with the vendor on the phone I thought this was relatively clear. I literally can't use the sheets since, because they're fitted, they're made specifically for a certain size bed (they have contours around the outside that are too large for my mattress). I'm telling you, any other vendor would have recognized this since I had gone back and forth several times with them changing the size. I really just think this salesperson didn't know what they were doing.

In any case, the vendor is refusing to refund the order because the manufacturer won't take it back. They are, however, offering to sell me a new set of sheets at wholesale price. I estimate wholesale price will probably be between $300 and $400. In my opinion, this is ridiculous. I wouldn't mind so much if I could actually use the sheets I have sitting on my shelf now, but I can't. What are my options here? Should I just order the sheets at wholesale price or should I dispute the charge? Am I being petty or do I actually have legitimate cause to dispute the charge and win? I realize it's nice of the vendor to offer the sheets at wholesale price, but I feel like if anything, half the blame is on them. I'd prefer them to comp me for half the price of these sheets and then offer me new sheets at wholesale price. Is that ridiculous for me to request?",Yes,Yes,No,Yes,Yes

I work in Information Security and make a decent salary (high enough to disqualify me for IRAs).

I contributed a small portion every pay period (twice a month) simply because I felt like it was the right thing to do. I recently changed employers and similarly, there's no match, but they will contribute about 15% of my salary to my 401(k). I was just wondering a few things:

1. Should I contribute to the traditional 401(k) at all since there's no match?
2. What should I do with the funds from my former 401(k)? Should I roll this over into my new employer-sponsored 401(k) or should I move this into an IRA? If going the IRA route, would I want to roll this into a traditional IRA or a backdoor Roth IRA? Why or why not?

rk4wzw,xyeLz,"Retirement Investment Selection Advice?

I'm in my mid-30s and changed jobs recently where I had an employer-sponsored 401(k) plan and made the decision to roll the balance over to my new employer-sponsored 401(k) plan with Empower.

I spoke with a couple people for investment advice. While I realize it's a personal decision, I was just hoping to poll the audience and get a more holistic consensus.

One of the pieces of advice I got was to split my investments up. We decided on 6 different funds including an index fund, blue chip growth fund, international fund, mid-cap, small-cap, and the traditional target retirement fund. The majority percentage (60%) would be allocated to the blue chip and index funds.

Another piece of advice I got was to split investments up evenly between four funds. This included the same blue chip, index, small cap, and target retirement fund, but left out the mid-cap and international fund.

Previously, all I was doing was dumping all contributions into the target retirement fund.

I'm young and don't mind risk, and I also don't mind (and somewhat enjoy) paying attention to my funds and rebalancing as necessary. Perhaps that's not the goal of a 401(k) and that it's designed to just set and leave alone? I'm not sure. Ideally, I would be able to confidently set my investments now and not have to touch it again for 10 years.

My wife and I are married but we file separately because she has several tens of thousands of dollars of college loans that she qualifies for an IDR repayment plan for with her income. If we filed jointly, she would not qualify and her loan payment would be in excess of $600/mo. She used to be a teacher at a private school for many years but due to COVID, has decided to teach reading online instead (self-employed). We estimate her income over the past year to be close to $10,000 (we still need to crunch some numbers around tax time). Since we're married filing separately, I believe there's a $10,000 income cap on contributions to a Roth IRA. I don't quite understand why these contributions would be different for filing single vs. married filing separately. Nonetheless, since my wife is self-employed and not making much money, I was hoping to set up some sort of retirement account for her. I was thinking a Roth IRA would make sense (if she qualifies) since her income is low and she would be in a lower tax bracket.

w1bs0z,xyeLz,"Considering rolling over 401k to IRA for one-time HSA transfer but don't want to jeopardize backdoor Roth IRA?

This is a pretty niche situation but I'm hoping someone here more savvy than me can help.

I have a 401k from a former employer that I rolled over to my current employer. According to my 401k servicer, I can only rollover the amount that was transferred, not anything that I've contributed since being at this employer. Both of these amounts are in the 5 figures.

The reason I would like to roll this over is so that I can perform a one-time transfer of some of these IRA funds into our HSA. My ultimate goal was to never touch the HSA and treat it like a retirement account, and then withdraw from it EITHER once I reached an appropriate age *or* if needed for medical expenses. We're also expecting our first child in September and our medical bills for this year have already met our deductible and then some, so at least having the option to use this for medical expenses in a crunch would be beneficial rather than having it sit in an IRA (or currently a 401k). IN BOTH CASES I would plan to withdraw the money tax free using receipts from medical bills saved over the years.

A few issues I have with this approach:

1. Right now, my employer contributes half of the max to my HSA (I contribute the remaining half) so if I decided to perform a one-time lifetime transfer, I would only want to contribute half of what the max is (otherwise the remaining half would be taxed), which seems like I could miss out on the possibility to contribute even more at some other point, for example if I changed employers and they didn't contribute to the HSA.
2. I would need to wait until the end of the year since I have been contributing the max YTD for the tax advantaged savings.
3. If I roll over my eligible 401k into an IRA, I will be rolling over more than the one-year maximum for the HSA. This means I will have money sitting in my IRA. I do currently have a Roth IRA and I have never attempted a backdoor Roth, but I liked having this as an option; however, I don't know what the complications might look like given the pro-rata rule if I proceed with this approach?",Yes,Yes,No,No,Yes

In 2019, I started maxing out my Roth IRA during my last year of college

In 2020, I maxed out my Roth IRA + HSA my first half year working full time.

In 2021, I will come close to maxing out my $19,500 of 401k contributions in addition to my Roth IRA and HSA.

And in 2022â€¦I am hesitant to keep putting away $500 into my Roth IRA at the start of each month because Iâ€™m not sure where my MAGI will end up next year. I do a decent amount of gig work and have bonuses at work as well.  I donâ€™t believe my 401k plan at work allows me to do backdooring over the $19,500 limit - this is something that Iâ€™d really like to do though.

(1) Should I wait to see how much I contribute to my Roth IRA until tax season of next year (start of 2023)? I am thinking of keeping funds in my high interest yielding stable coin account, paying ~8%, in the meantime.

(2) I am going to reach out to the 401k administrator to see if I can contribute more than the limit - but I work at a smaller firm and donâ€™t think it is allowed. Should I start an after tax brokerage account?

Dear TurboTax Customer, 
 
We are contacting you because you had unemployment income on your 2020 tax return when you filed earlier this year. 
 
Great news! The first $10,200 of your unemployment income may now be tax-free, if your household income is less than $150,000, based on the recently passed American Rescue Plan. 
 
Even better news: The IRS says you don't need to do anything right now to take advantage of this benefit. The IRS assures us there is no faster way to get any additional money you are owed! Amending your return could delay your payment.
 
The IRS has not provided specific timing and details yet. We will reach back out when they do. You can also check the blog post here, for the latest information.

Hey all,

This might be a silly (or legit) concern but I am unsure about making extra payments on my car loan despite having the extra income to do so. I bought the car brand new (don't throw stones at me) - it's a 2019 Toyota RAV4 - and I love it. My goal from the get-go was to pay it off and keep driving it for 15-20+ years. Total amount financed was $30k but I'm down to $23k now. I wanted to buy it used but I fell in love with the new body style and have never been a fan of the old body style. Also, RAV4's hold their resale value really well so I'm not sure if I'm buying a one year used model would have made a huge difference.

I have the ability to make extra payments to the car loan every week (side hustle) but I'm paranoid to do so because I will not have equity in the car for the first year. I'd prefer the GAP insurance to pay for the difference in case the car was to get totaled instead of me footing the bill in the forms of extra payments. Is this a silly or valid concern?
