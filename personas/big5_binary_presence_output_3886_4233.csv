I haven't had health insurance in over a decade, but I'm considering enrolling in a healthcare plan today. It's very expensive, but I need to have a surgical procedure. Are there any negative ramifications if I cancel my health insurance after the procedure (1-3 months later).

Will this have any effect if I try to enroll again the following year? Or any other future years? Will this affect my rates?

I'm self-employed, in my 30's, first time opening a retirement account and saving. I decided to go with a traditional IRA instead of a roth because I plan to do a little bit of swing trading inside that account and I do not want to pay capital taxes on those profits. Was I right to do this?

Is my understanding correct that I can treat this traditional IRA just like my regular brokerage account where I buy and sell stocks and do some swing trading (I plan on being more conservative with ETFs and blue-chip stocks)? The only difference is that cash can only go in but I can't cash out any money out of the account until I reach my retirement age, it can only be re-invested (unless I pay an early withdrawal penalty).

1. Why can't I only contribute a max of $6,000 per year? Considering I haven't contribured anything since I turned 18 (that's 17 years), why can't I contribute more if I have a good year?

2. I see that Vanguard and Fidelity are always recommended but I went with Schwab because Fidelity couldn't link up my credit union for funding.

106tgjz,MonsieurVox,"It's good practice to keep a freeze on your credit report at all times unless actively applying for credit

While all 3 credit bureaus have decent fraud detection to help reduce the risk of identity theft, keeping a freeze on your credit reports prevents new credit from being opened altogether. You can set up freezes for free with all of the bureaus, and it only takes a few minutes. There is literally no downside to doing this, except for the small bit of friction that comes with having to unfreeze your credit when you want to get a new credit card, car loan, etc.

I found out about this a couple years ago when I noticed a fraudulent credit application on my Equifax report.

Thankfully they were not successful in their credit application.

Now, I keep a freeze on my reports at all times. When/if I apply for credit, I can go in and schedule a ""thaw"" for a period of time, which takes less than 5 minutes.

This can also be done for people who you know won't need to apply for credit at all or any time soon, such as children, elderly, or disabled people.

10fbmqw,MonsieurVox,"Comparing job offers with drastically different compensation/benefit packages

I'm currently interviewing at a company and am likely to get an offer. I'm a (relatively) high income earner for my area and expect this new company to have a lower cash compensation than my current employer. What this new company lacks in cash compensation, they make up for in benefits and work/life balance. I'm just having a hard time figuring out how to compare the two packages. Here are some details:

Current employer:

* Total cash compensation: $215,000 (including base pay and stock, no bonuses)
* Mid-level position
* Full medical/dental/vision
* 401k match: 2%
* PTO: 3 weeks per year (plus 1 week of personal/sick time, so 4 weeks total) plus major holidays
* No parental leave (not relevant now, but may be in 2-3 years)

Potential new employer:

* Total cash compensation: \~$185,000 (estimated from [levels.fyi](https://levels.fyi) and includes base pay and annual bonuses)
* Higher level position
* Full medical/dental/vision
* 8% 401k match (drastic difference when compounded over years)
* PTO: 5 weeks per year plus major holidays
* Pension
* 3 months parental leave

Basically, when comparing the two, my current employer strikes me as very cash-heavy, while the second employer has a much more well-rounded comp/benefits package. My expenses are low enough that the pay hit wouldn't impact me negatively much if at all, but a \~15% pay cut for a higher level position seems hard to justify even for more benefits.

11cp78n,MonsieurVox,"Struggling to quantitatively compare HSA vs PPO options

Quick background: I'm starting a new job soon and have the option to choose between a plan with an HSA and a PPO. I'm well aware of the tax benefits of an HSA and have been using one for about a year or so, but I have some fairly expensive medications that are making me second guess myself.

As with most (all?) HSA plans, the cost of prescriptions is 100% until the deductible is met, then 10% copay thereafter until the OOP max is met.

With the PPO/PCA plan, approved medications are 10% copay from the beginning. The company also gives you $750 on a debit card for medical expenses (I think this is called an FSA?)

I don't recall what the OOP max is for them, but I remember them being pretty close.

Here's what I'm looking at for each plan:

||PPO Plan|HSA Plan|
|:-|:-|:-|
|Annual Premium|$1,950|$825|
|Annual Payroll Contribution|$0|$3,850|
|Annual Employer Contribution|$(750)|$0|
|Deductible|$1,500|$1,500|
|Tax Savings (24% bracket)|$(468)|$(1,122)|
|Annual medication cost (est.)|$192|$1,638|
|Total out of pocket (premium + meds)|$2,142|$2,463|
|Total savings (tax savings + employer contribution)|$(1,218)|$(1,122)|
|Net cost|$924|$1,341|

Ostensibly, the net cost for the HSA is about $400 more annually, but it doesn't feel like a fair comparison because that doesn't account for the money I'm stashing away into the HSA that I get to keep and invest. Even if it costs me $400 more per year out of pocket, my thinking is that the remaining invest-able cash that goes into my HSA should more than make up for that over time. 

I'm also not sure how to factor in doctor's appointments or things like x-rays that occur as needed, so I excluded them from my calculations altogether.

My general takeaway is that the PPO plan would be a lot easier and more convenient in the short term, but the HSA has a long-term payoff if I stick with it.

Am I missing or overlooking something?",Yes,Yes,No,Yes,No
129r0f6,MonsieurVox,"How do people generally save for large investments like a rental property?

**TL;DR up front: How does one save for a large investment like a rental property? Despite having a good income and net worth, stockpiling the cash required to make this purchase seems daunting without making impactful changes like changing my 401k/IRA contributions, selling investments, etc.**

For those who read all of this, thank you very much and apologies for the brain dump!

For those who have invested in real estate (or other capital intensive investment), what specifically did you do to pile up the cash? 

* How much did you save?
* How long did it take you to save that much?
* Did you keep the money in a HYSA or invest it?
* Did you stop or slow down retirement account contributions to have more cash to save?
* Did you take out a loan for the down payment? Was it a business loan, personal loan, 401k loan, something else?
* What other ""levers"" are there to pull?

For some additional context, I'm 30 years old and a pretty high income earner in my area (roughly $210,000 gross after bonuses in a decently low cost of living area). I can generally max out my tax-advantaged retirement accounts, but I want to make an eventual move out of the 9-5 lifestyle and into something like real estate. My parents own rental properties so I'm well aware of the work that goes into them and am under no delusion that real estate is ""passive income.""

Financially, I have roughly $240,000 in investments:

* $190,000 401k
* $30,000 Roth IRA
* $9,000 taxable brokerage (this is earmarked specifically for this investment)
* $10,000 crypto 

I also have:

* $18,000 in my emergency fund
* $10,000 in an I bond
* \~$120,000 in home equity in my primary residence

The absolute *cheapest* property in my area that is livable and/or wouldn't require an immense amount of rehab is around \~$200,000, so at *minimum* I'd need $40,000 to even have a shot. I'd likely need much more when factoring in the expenses that come with purchasing a piece of real estate.

Despite having a good income, I'm finding it difficult to save enough cash to be able to put down the requisite 20% for something like a multi-family home. 

I wouldn't want to take out my Roth IRA contributions, I wouldn't want to take a 401k loan, my emergency fund is right at 6 months and gives me peace of mind, and the I bond is only \~5 months old. So despite having a net worth of \~$400,000+, very little of it is actually usable without taking a hit in taxes, selling my 2.875% mortgage house, etc.

If I wanted to buy in the next year, the most logical thing that I see would be to sell the crypto, liquidate the brokerage account, sell the I bond, and set aside that \~$30k in a HYSA and continually add to it over the coming months. Unfortunately I'd be taking a loss on all of those, but that's what I get for taking a short-sighted approach.

Past that, what other things might I be overlooking? Would it be foolish to slow down 401k/IRA contributions? A HELOC seems risky, but is that a common option for folks getting into real estate?

13rnc43,MonsieurVox,"Vanguard vs. Fidelity

As a bit of background, I have my company 401k, HSA, and a Cash Management account through Fidelity. I'm generally pleased with their customer service and prefer their interface more than Vanguard. I opened my Roth IRA (and subsequent Traditional IRA for backdoor Roth purposes) with Vanguard a few years ago and have my funds invested entirely in their S&P 500 and Growth index funds (I realize there's an overlap between the two, so I'm debating putting it all in the S&P or total market, but that's a topic for another thread).

I'm considering moving my Roth IRA over to Fidelity but want to make sure I'm not overlooking anything. 

1. How much more risk would I be exposed to by having nearly all of my funds with one institution?
2. Is there a reason to convert my VFAIX --> FXAIX? As in, is it cheaper to hold Fidelity funds within a Fidelity account or does that not make a difference?

143hk4e,MonsieurVox,"Does it make sense to convert my Vanguard funds to Fidelity funds?

To be brief, I moved my Roth IRA from Vanguard to Fidelity.

I'm about 50/50 in VIGAX and VFAIX, with both having about $17,000 invested in them ($34,000 total account balance). I bought these funds while my IRA was with Vanguard so of course didn't pay any fees at that time. 

I was considering consolidating both funds into FXAIX since there's already a big overlap between the Vanguard funds and the expense ratio is lower for the Fidelity version of the S&P 500 fund.

I want to a) double check my math and b) see if I'm overlooking anything.

* On the convert funds page, it looks like there would be a $75 fee to do this for each fund. 
* VIGAX has a 0.05% expense ratio.
* VFAIX has a 0.04% expense ratio.
* FXAIX has a 0.015% expense ratio.

Annualized, this would be:

* ($17,000 x .005) + ($17,000 x .004) = $153 in fees at Vanguard
* (34,000 x 0.0015) = $51 in fees at Fidelity if I exchanged
* $102 in fee savings at Fidelity annually (everything else equal), so roughly a 1.5 year break-even period to sell the Vanguard funds (2 \* $75 = $150)

Does that look right?

Just at a fee level, it seems like a no brainer since it's a short break-even period and it would save me thousands over the course of my retirement journey. 

There's a huge overlap in holdings between VIGAX and VFAIX, so I think it makes sense to collapse those down into one fund, and then of course VFAIX and FXAIX should be identical with the exception of interest rate.

It's obviously not a make or break decision, more of an optimization.

Am I overlooking anything?",Yes,Yes,No,No,No
14c3kv9,MonsieurVox,"What does an FDIC insurance claim really look like?

166n4ig,MonsieurVox,"Does it makes sense to put in a homeowner's insurance claim for this?

A few weeks ago I was carrying a fold-able/collapsible crate down my stairs that had two buckets of paint in it from a recent bathroom remodel. As I got to the top of the stairs, the crate collapsed (go figure), and two buckets of paint tumbled down the stairs, exploding, leaving paint all over the stairs, floors, front door, and walls. After spending an entire afternoon and into the evening trying to clean up what I could, I ultimately had to make the decision to entirely replace the floors and have the walls repainted. 

I didn't even think to contact my insurance about this at the time and paid for it out of pocket using my emergency fund and some cash flow. All in, the project cost me about $10,500 (materials and labor) and my front door still has paint on it. From the date of the incident to the job being done was less than a week.

I got some pictures during the attempted cleanup, but was so busy panicking immediately after it happened that I didn't get pics immediately after it happened at its worst.

Since this was sudden and accidental damage, it *should* be covered by my insurance. I have a deductible of about $3,600, so I'd net about $6,900 if I put in a claim.

Here's why I'm not sure if I should put in a claim:

* I had literally *just* switched my insurance a week or so before the accident. Would this set off fraud alerts or anything from my insurance company? Everything is above-board, but I'd worry it'd result in an immediate non-renewal or something.
* I worry about my rates increasing significantly and having a claim on my history. I have never put in a claim on my auto/home policy, and because of that, have some decent discounts. 
* I'm not sure if this is significant enough of an incident to warrant a homeowner's claim. I'm in a fortunate enough financial position that I was able to pay for this out of pocket and it not financially ruin me.

I know that this is what insurance is for, but I always thought of homeowner's insurance as something that you only use in the case of true catastrophes (house burns down, hail storm destroys roof, etc.).

18k21mf,MonsieurVox,"With the 4% (or 5%) safe withdrawal rule, is there really a need to move to more conservative investments as you get older?

Basically the title. Assuming someone has more than enough saved for retirement â€” enough that they can withstand market downturns and not be devastated â€” does it always make sense to move those investments to things like value stocks, bonds, and treasuries as you get older?

I understand the idea in principle: Allocate a percentage of your portfolio to ""safer"" investments when you get older when you are less focused on growth and more focused on preservation. But it seems like, over time, you are leaving a lot of growth on the table that could be passed down to your children or donated to a cause near to your heart when you pass.

For context, I'm in my early 30s and am currently 100% invested in S&P 500 index funds in my retirement accounts. Have roughly $300k invested at this point. I have a long runway before retirement, so I'm not particularly concerned about bear markets or stock market downturns because I could essentially start over from $0 at this point and still be okay. Obviously we don't know what the future holds, but for the top 500 companies (or the total stock market) to collapse would effectively mean utter financial devastation for the US, would it not?

uz4nmd,MonsieurVox,"Contributing to a taxable brokerage instead of a mega backdoor Roth - am I making a big mistake?

Hey good folks, got a question that I haven't been able to find a clear answer for. I'll first give some background, which should help clarify why I'm asking my question.


**Background**: I recently started a new job with a gross pay of around $220k. This is more than I've ever made before, and along with it came some decisions that I had to make and topics I had to research. I'm also single with no kids, I own a house, and have a paid off car. I have no other debt other than my house.

I'm maxing out my Traditional 401k (for the tax deduction) and Roth IRA. My company also allows after-tax contributions and an in-plan conversion (aka mega backdoor Roth) on those contributions. 

Since I am aiming to invest about 25% of my gross income, maxing out my Traditional 401k ($20,500) and backdoor Roth ($6,000) is gets me to ~11% of my gross income, which leaves about $28,500 on the table to invest. I also dabble in crypto but that's purely speculative and I'm not including that in my retirement percentage.

I will be 30 years old at the end of this year, and currently have about $200,000 in retirement savings; this mostly consists of a previous employer's 401k and my Roth IRA. 

Because I already have a nice chunk in retirement and am mostly taking advantage of all of the tax benefits of the 401k and Roth IRA accounts, for the last few months I have been contributing to my taxable brokerage account *instead* of doing the mega backdoor Roth for the flexibility it provides. To be specific:

1. Those funds can be withdrawn without penalty and could be used for a bridge account for early retirement 
2. I could use those funds to eventually purchase a cash flowing asset, a down payment for a rental property/AirBnB, or some other cash-flowing asset (which is a longer term goal of mine)

**This background leads me to my questions:**

* I feel like I understand the opportunity cost of not doing the backdoor Roth, but am I overlooking something? 
* Is this a terrible idea? 
* Would it be better to compromise and contribute a bit into the mega backdoor portion and reduce my taxable brokerage contributions?

I've only been doing this for a few months, so it should be easy to course-correct if this was a bad idea. Appreciate the outside set of eyes. :)",Yes,Yes,No,Yes,No
vv55tc,MonsieurVox,"Mutual fund vs. ETF in terms of ""buying at a discount""

Hey all, got a pretty basic question that I'm hoping someone can clarify for me. Hopefully I can word this in a way that makes sense.

When choosing between two equivalent investments in the form of mutual funds and ETFs (let's say VFIAX and VOO, respectively), holding everything else equal (fees, etc.), does it matter which type someone purchases? 

Here's what I mean. As the market goes down, the price of a single ""unit"" or share of VOO becomes cheaper. As the market goes up, so does the price of that same share of VOO. So, when people talk about ""buying at a discount,"" the analogy makes perfect sense. (Recognizing that it's an imperfect analogy.)

When contributing to the mutual fund version of what is essentially the same investment, does that same principle hold true? 

My understanding is that a mutual fund is essentially a giant pool of money that gets allocated into a variety of investments based on the purpose of the fund. In this way, you aren't exactly ""buying shares"" so much as you are contributing to the overall pool of money.

I'm probably overthinking it, and I would assume that the same idea applies to both mutual funds and ETFs, but I'm hoping someone can explain it to me in a way that makes sense.",Yes,Yes,No,Yes,No
x01vo7,MonsieurVox,"Looking for an automatic/friction-less budget experience

Hey good folks! Feel free to skip the context if you're not interested and go straight to the question.

**Context**

I get paid monthly and typically setup an Excel spreadsheet at the end of one month/beginning of a new month to plan out my zero-based budget. This has worked for me pretty well so far as it gives me a birds-eye view of where my money is going and how much I can safely spend. What has also worked for me is to build in a spillover/miscellaneous category that's roughly 10% of my take-home pay so it's not the end of the world if I spend a little extra on groceries, if I need to buy some clothes for a special event on short notice, etc. because there's flexibility built in.

**Question**

What I haven't been able to figure out yet is a way to automatically get a monthly report (or something similar) that shows me how closely I adhered to my budget. I know that Mint has budget alerts, but the fact that most banks have implemented MFA for login has added a lot more friction into this process. I basically have to login to each of my financial institutions several times per week or month to keep them updated which is not only tedious, but kind of defeats the purpose of automated budget alerts.

Does anyone know of a setup that is actually automatic?

xn55u5,MonsieurVox,"Is there any real reason to do a backdoor Roth IRA when my company offers a mega backdoor Roth 401(k)?

For some quick context, starting this year I now make too much to directly contribute to a Roth IRA.

* Roughly $10,000/year going into after-tax 401k, which will be converted to Roth at year-end (mega backdoor Roth)

- **Question 1**: How am I doing overall?

I know people get annoyed with these, but I swear I've never done one! I'm 33 and have been following personal finance blogs (like MMM) and this sub since I graduated college. I think I'm a diligent saver who has found a balance between living and being frugal:

Salary - $120k

Checking account - $23k

I-bonds - $10.5k

Taxable investments - $8k

Crypto - $4k

401k - $145k

Roth IRA - $78k


Co-Op value (according to Zillow, grain of salt etc...) - $270k

Mortgage remaining - $172k

Monthly payment (with HOA) - $1800

- **Question 2**: Is this an ok allocation?

I also wanted to ask about my allocations. Are there better allocations I could use for my personality and age?

Roth IRA is with Vanguard. I have:

45% VFIAX

45% VTSAX

10% VBTLX

My 401k also offers Vanguard funds, and I am:

92% VSMPX

8% VBTIX

- **Question 3**: 

When I first graduated I hated working and gravitated to places like MMM because I wanted it to end as soon as possible. However, after job hopping, I got a job as an R&amp;D engineer in the national lab/university ecosystem. I love it, it gives me no existential dread, and this is the dream job I always imagined when I was taking high school physics. However, salary growth in this field is extremely limited from where I am. I only got to my current salary by getting competing job offers in industry and being a real hardass and showing willingness to leave.

The conventional wisdom on this sub (and /r/askengineers) is that you should hop jobs every 3-5 years, and if you didn't get a 9% raise this year you're a loser for staying at your job and you should have been interviewing 6 months ago. However, I remember what working in a corporation or small business is like and honestly it's soul-crushingly terrible compared to my current job.

However, I do want to have a house and kids and all that, and in my area, even with a nearly $100k down payment, that's a $4k a month bill, so that would be difficult for me and a spouse earning similarly to me. I don't know if I'd be able to give my kids the middle class childhood I had on my current salary and that also gives me existential dread.

Sometimes reading this sub and its tone makes me feel like a loser who isn't doing what a responsible adult does to maximize income. Sometimes I feel like throwing up my hands, building a Github on nights and weekends, and transferring to software development and hopping jobs and playing that game. Sometimes I feel like life is pretty good though because I currently enjoy my job and girlfriend and I think I have a decent savings rate.

From the discussion on /r/personalfinance, it looks like T-bills are preferred to CDs because you don't pay state income tax (I'm in NY). I was also told not to get the T-bills through Treasury Direct and instead get them on the secondary market. I use Vanguard for my Roth IRA, so I went there. This is the page for buying T-bills on Vanguard:

Do I only go by the maturity date? What if I get one that matures in August, thinking that it's a 26-week one, but it was a 52-week one from last August and I'm getting less interest?

Speaking of interest, what is the interest I will get? The Yield to worst bid? Yield to maturity bid? Is that the annual rate, and what I'll actually get that pro-rated from the moment I buy until the maturity?

How do I actually get the money? Will Vanguard be collecting the interest payments from the Treasury every month and then putting it in my account? And then at maturity, the T bill disappears and I just have the full $100 per bill?

And lastly, how do I buy? I've checked at various points during the day and the Buy and Sell buttons on the left are always grayed out. I can check the boxes of the bills on the right. But the only option that allows at the bottom is ""Build Ladder"". Is this what I want to do?

401ks: No tax in, no tax for growth, yes tax on the way out = Double tax benefits

Roth IRA: Yes tax in, no tax for growth, no tax on the way out = Double tax benefits

Does that make sense? If so, then why don't people call 401ks or Roth IRAs ""double tax savings"" like they call HSAs ""triple tax savings""? Or have I actually been paying ""growth"" taxes on my 401k and Roth IRA without ever realizing it?",Yes,Yes,No,Yes,No

I think I can reasonably expect it to hit that $500,000 limit by my 60s, even if I don't contribute anymore. I'm wondering if it makes sense to now start contributing to next year's Roth IRA with Fidelity, in the same equivalent S&amp;P500 fund. And once that hits $100k, or higher given the reduced time to retirement, start with another one. Now that most reputable brokerage providers have index fund fees that have basically settled at 0%, I could probably hop between a few my whole life in this way.

But my reading into the US's financial institutions have not inspired confidence. I am coming at this from a point of maximum cynicism. I simply have an irrational distrust of all financial companies (although I do trust that they will continue to move heaven and earth to continue to maximize profits, hence my throwing everything into the S&amp;P500).

12a9t9c,Mother_Welder_5272,"Discussion - Spending rules of thumb: In the US, has the fundamental proportion of the average salary going to housing vs. other goods changed?

I was talking to some people about traditional rules of thumb, like your mortgage/rent should be 1 weeks pay and so on. It's obviously nearly impossible to follow that rule if you're an average earner looking for average lodgings in 2023. But when talking to some older people, I got a new perspective.

While many of them were able to abide by that rule, the cost of other goods was just so much more. Cars were half a year's salary or more. TVs and entertainment were significant financial purchases. Random things like barbecues, playpens for your kids, matresses, everything seems like it cost a high percentage of your salary now.

I'm not an economist, but I did come across this chart, which seems to fit my hypothesis:

https://preview.redd.it/i8ymt1dgem961.jpg?width=824&auto=webp&s=fd72e1958f8dff0da0d8d40cf8c607e0aa5f9095

And I'd assume that the trends were even more striking if you went back 50 years. It made me think that maybe we're not in such a bad situation if we're ""breaking"" the 25% or 36% or whatever rule. I can literally get a mattress, TV, game console and 5 video games for less than the monthly cost of my 1 bedroom condo. It doesn't seem like that was the reality 20, 30, 40, years ago. 

In my life today, as a single man, housing and health insurance/health care are my biggest expenses by a long shot, they just dwarf all my other spending. It's easy for me to spend very little money and be fully entertained and fed *once my shelter costs are taken care of*. If I had the same lifestyle 40 years ago, I have this hypothesis that even if you normalize for my spending, the proportion going to those big categories and other miscellaneous expenses would be quite different.

It seems that rent/house prices are some of the most subjective when it comes to a free market. The prices will literally go as high as the market will bear, and the prices will always be an arbitrary gauge as to the available salary of the population. Unlike things like TVs, there's not really a competitive aspect that will force sellers to go down.

I wonder what the effects of that are on budgeting and such. What do you think? Will this trend continue?",No,No,No,No,No
12ejkke,Mother_Welder_5272,"Is it possible to thrive in this PF space if you are the type of person who has ties of some sort to path in life? And it's not so easy to change up your life to ""increase income""?

I've hung around the FI and /r/personalfinance space for over a decade. I believe I've mastered the art of how to make every penny coming in count. However, into my 30s, I'm still ""stuck"" at the $120k-ish salary range in a VHCOL. I would like to own a house with my SO, but there's no way I can afford a $4.5k mortgage for a 2 bedroom starter house as is the standard in my area. I have business ideas that would require me to quit my full time job and have no salary for over a year, which I can't pull off yet.

Whenever discussions like this come up in these subreddits, the conclusion is generally simply a cold ""increase your income"". However, that phrase is generally pretty loaded, and implies a much different life outlook. For me it's simple to read the fine print of a tax-advantaged account or sign up for Vanguard or Fidelity or an HSA or stop buying lattes in the morning or whatever.

But on the other hand, I'm a mechanical engineer, specifically working in R&D. I'm sentient and go to Reddit, so clearly I know that software engineers make so much more money and have control of the market. But being a mechanical engineer to me is something more special. It's the culmination of a childhood of Legos, Knex, Formula 1 racing, college projects, the pride of my output being a physical thing I'm happy with, rather than an abstract piece of code that converts different medical record types or makes a faceless corporation's logo fade in nicely on their website. It's the thing I've told people at barbecues that I do and I get oohs and aahs, and I feel good about myself at the end of the day. But obviously, my earning is limited. I have scoured LinkedIn, changed jobs, and gotten offers from companies in my state and all neighboring states, and usually they're not any more than I earn now. There's a fundamental part of me that feels like I'd kind of be a faceless schlub in the way I viewed myself if I just sighed, spent the few years changing fields, and went with the generic job that pays more in corporate law or business consulting or whatever.

I also know that the advice is often to move. Move to a lower cost of living area and save more. Move to a popping city where you can maximize your earnings early in life, etc... But I do have a very active social life in my current area, with a very big network of family and friends. I have constant invites to barbecues and board games, and impromptu nights that give me belly laughs so hard I can't breathe. It's a good life in that regard, and I feel privileged in that I can't relate at all to the news stories saying ""X% of Americans can't name a single friend, say they suffer from loneliness"". I think it really helps my mental health and it feels un-intuitive to leave that.

And I guess I've always just had a predilection for admiring people who have a life calling that extends beyond just making money in a faceless corporate job. For example, right now, there are startups trying to do wild work with neural implants. There's currently no active market for it, nobody is selling these to consumers. It's an industry that runs on VC money and government grants. But one day, in 2030 or 2040, when the first implant that can record your dreams to a video is commercially available for purchase, to me, the ""honor"" lies with those engineers and researchers who stuck it out for decades. Who could have ""maximized their income"" by working a generic job, and maybe even took paycuts when the VC money ran out, but they had something to get out of bed for, which resulted in something that genuinely changes the world. Thinking about being like one of those people just excites me in a way that ""Emotionlessly switch jobs every 2-3 years to maximize your income"" and ""choose a field that pays the most. The field is subject to change often, so don't get attached to any specific one"" does not. Yet it's hard to deny that being like me can limit your income, and in today's economy, maybe not even give me the standard of living with housing and leisure options that my parents and grandparents had. To me, this is a constant struggle that I'm beating myself up over. Do I ""sell out"" or do I stay the course? Are there better ways I can look at and contextualize my life? 

Are there any financial subreddits that talk about this human/mental side of saving, rather than just the dollars and cents and investment portfolios and strategies? I've gone to the therapy, but I haven't found a therapist who really satisfies what I want out of these discussions. I understand that my reasoning is seen by some people as me being a small town loser who can't realize I'm making excuses for not fully hustling and taking life by the horns or whatever. And some people think it's really nice that I have something driving me besides just money and the dream of a generic vacation at a beach resort. But I'm generally very conflicted.",No,No,No,No,No

I feel like I'm hyper aware of every dollar I spend at the moment I spend it, even with a credit card, and putting it in a monthly statement or spreadsheet form does nothing for my understanding of how frugal I'm being.

For example (I'll use round numbers that demonstrate my situation), I bought a condo in late 2019 for $200k. Right now, it's worth $250k. I refinanced in late 2020 and it's a ~3% loan and I have $175k left on it. Let's say I want to move up to a $500k house within a year or so. Now, mortgage rates are higher, and I'd assume it would be 6% by the time I buy. From the order of operations here:

https://www.zillow.com/sellers-guide/what-happens-when-you-sell-a-house-with-a-mortgage/

It looks like I would sell my condo at $250k, pay off the $175k, and after fees, have something like $50k to apply as an extra downpayment or just hold as an emergency fund. However, that means I'm taking a **~$400k mortgage at 6% for the new house (assuming I also apply $50k I'd been saving for the new downpayment)**.

Wouldn't it be better to not apply any of the sale funds to the mortgage? After fees, let's say I net $225k in cash after the sale. And then just dump that all into a downpayment on the house?

From my estimates this would give me a lower monthly payment, and have me pay less interest over the life of both loans.

As a long time lurker of this sub, I'm well aware that 99% of comments are ""My time frame is retirement, decades away! I'm not thinking short term at all!"" I agree with the sentiment, and it's what I'm doing for my own finances. 

However, I'm also the ""finance guy"" for my parents. My dad retired last year at 65, his 401k is 60% stocks, 40% bonds. He's lucky in that his pension and Social Security cover my parent's living expenses, they haven't had to touch the 401k yet (which is up in the 6 figures). But he's thinking about getting a boat, and other potential purchases down the line and was asking me what to do.

This doesn't really come up on this sub a lot. I was thinking every year we could transfer a few percent more of the allocation from stocks into bonds. But of course when you're in retirement, you don't have that long window time frame to count on. Is it better to cut the losses from this recent drop/pending recession and maybe shift like 20% of more into the bonds?",Yes,Yes,No,Yes,No

I recently went on a foreign trip. To get local cash, I withdrew from an ATM using my Charles Schwab card. No ATM fees and I'm feeling thrifty.

I took my cash back to my local Chase branch in the good old USA and asked the teller to exchange it for USD. I got that blank stare, they went to the back to ask their boss and came out saying they can't do that there. I went to another Chase branch and it was the same thing.

I spent some time researching and then realized that for the amount I was saving on airport fees, I was working for $5 an hour. Next time I went to the airport I just converted it back.

wj808y,Mother_Welder_5272,"Is it ok to take money out from a Roth IRA for a house down payment if I've been ""oversaving"" for a long time? (33 years old)

I graduated college in 2011 (33 years old) and have gone from a $50k job out of college, back to school for a Master's, to a $120k job now. I've always been a heavy saver. Outside of saving up for a 20% down payment for my $215k 1 bedroom condo a few years ago, I throw everything into tax advantaged accounts, maxing out my 401k and Roth IRA as often as I can. I've usually run pretty lean with the emergency funds, just because no one depends on me and I live pretty cheap. I was single and lived a bachelor life for most of my 20s. My only other factor was $10k put into a side business that doesn't look like it's going to go anywhere in the end.

My status:

Salary - $120k

Roth IRA (with previous 401ks rolled in) - $80k

401k (been at my current job for 5 years) - $140k

I-bonds - $10k

Crypto/Brokerage Stocks - $15k

Condo Mortgage - $173k left

Condo value - probably $230-250k now

Bank checkings/savings - $15k

No other student loan, credit card, or auto debt.

I've read enough of this subreddit to know that I'm probably ""oversaving"". I only have $15k of liquid money, and maybe double that if I liquidate all my non-retirement funds (although there would be taxes for sure). The thing is, I feel like I've now been growing up a bit. I've had some serious relationships recently and could now see myself settling down in a single family house. Not now, not with anyone in particular, but maybe in the next 3-5 years. Even if not that, I was curious about keeping an eye on the real estate market and looking for a good deal on a rental property, again in the time span of a few years.

With the way houses are costing now ($500-700k+ in my area), I'm thinking that if I pulled the trigger on any of these, I'd have to have a solid $100k in down payment. Of course if I did it with a spouse, they'd probably contribute. And in that case, ideally I'd like to keep my condo and rent it out. But I feel a little behind when I see that I only have a tiny fraction of that ready.

I know that I can take contributions and rollovers out of the Roth IRA penalty free. And probably $40k of the IRA is available to take out penalty free right now. I know that all financial advice frequently tells you never to raid your retirement accounts. And that if buying a house is in your goals, you should save for the down payment before contributing past the employer match (The Prime Directive, etc...). But when I look at my net worth history chart, I feel like it kind of worked out for me. By shoveling money into the S&amp;P 500 since 2011, I've been able to make good gains on these vehicles of Roth IRAs and 401ks that can be taken out/borrowed from with no tax penalty.

If I had followed the prime directive perfectly, I may have had $100k in liquid savings, but maybe like $50k in retirement savings and have missed out on a lot of compound growth. Rather than having &gt;$200k in retirement savings and only $15k in liquid savings.

I guess my problem is more conceptual. I feel instinctively that pulling out from the retirement accounts for a down payment is ""bad"". But since I had a time scale of a decade or more before needing that big down payment, I feel like oversaving in retirements accounts, letting it grow a little, and then pulling it out, was probably the best move.

So is pulling money out of a Roth IRA or taking a 401k loan for a down payment a bad idea? Should I just revert to not contributing to the Roth IRA anymore and no 401k past match, and take til I'm 40 to rebuild a liquid checking account of 100k (at which point houses will probably be even more expensive?)",Yes,Yes,No,Yes,Yes

https://www.irs.gov/retirement-plans/plan-participant-employee/retirement-savings-contributions-savers-credit

She hasn't spent that money and doesn't plan to, except for incidentals while at college (maybe $100 a month). I wonder if there's any reason why she shouldn't just open up a Roth IRA and put $2k into it and get the 50% saver's credit of $1k back when she does her taxes with me.

Even if she is being risk averse and is afraid of the market, can't she just put it in a money market or fixed income account, get the $1k, and then when she graduates next year, withdraw her Roth IRA contributions from the money market account penalty-free and it would be as if she left it in her checking's account?

1855gan,Mountebank,"How much of an income increase would I need for it to make sense to move across the country and go from owning to renting?

I currently live on the East Coast in a HCOL area making around 90k. I also own a 1 bed condo with 3.75% mortgage.

Lately, I've been thinking about moving to the West Coast (Bay Area) to increase my income and be closer to more opportunities, but I'm having a hard time pinning down the minimum salary increase I would need to make such a move worthwhile. Also, this is hand-on, laboratory based engineering work, so the places where I can live and find work in this field are limited with the Bay Area being a major hub.

With interest rates what they currently are and prices what they are in the Bay Area, there's no way I'd be able to buy a comparable condo, so I would have to go back to renting. I really don't know how to calculate this to convert into an equivalent salary increase to break even. It's not as simple as ""new rent - current mortgage + closing and selling fees"", right?

Another reason I'm considering this move is that I've discovered that I really don't like snow, so I will make this or a similar move eventually, but I don't think this is enough of a reason to rush. I can endure another winter or two waiting for the right opportunity, but knowing what that right opportunity is is the main crux of this question.

My current math is something like: (current salary * COLA difference + cost of housing difference) * minimum acceptable raise = minimum acceptable salary to make this move.

rkrgt2,Mountebank,"If youâ€™re covered by a 401k at work, what income range makes sense for a traditional IRA vs Roth?

I donâ€™t know why this doesnâ€™t get mentioned more when this discussion comes up, but the limit for being able to take deductions for Traditional IRA contributions is fairly low if youâ€™re also covered by a retirement plan at work. For a single filer, itâ€™s currently $66k. Between $66k-$76k youâ€™re only allowed a partial deduction. So if youâ€™re above $76k, thereâ€™s no benefit to a Traditional if Roth is still an option for you.  At the same time, if your income is low a Roth is recommended since the tax savings from a Traditional isnâ€™t all that valuable. 

So, that leaves a middle zone where a Traditional might be more advantageous. What exactly is this zone? My first guess is the range where your income tax is 22% while still below the deduction limit, so around $40.5k-$66k. Between $66k-$76k, youâ€™d do a mix between Traditional and Roth as your partial deduction limit allows. Below $40.5k and above $76k would be Roth until itâ€™s no longer an option.

Does this sound like a reasonable strategy? Am I missing anything?

PS: it was hard to find since a lot of websites donâ€™t mention it, but the partial deduction formula is fairly simple. For a single filer, itâ€™s 60% of how far away you are from $76k. So if your MAGI is $70k, then youâ€™re allowed to deduct 0.6 * $6k, or $3600. So youâ€™d contribute $3600 to a Traditional and $2400 to a Roth.",Yes,Yes,No,Yes,No

For 2022 I suspect that I'll end up somewhere in the partially deductible traditional IRA range, so I'm trying to figure out what the best and easiest way to handle that will be. It's possible that I'm way over-thinking this, but I wanted to double check beforehand. Some options:

1. Contribute 6k to traditional IRA throughout the year, then recharacterize some to Roth when tax filing time comes. My problem is that I have no idea how easy or hard this is. Is it a lot of paperwork?

2. Wait until tax filing time to contribute. This is probably the easiest, but I'd lose out on a year's worth of growth.

3. Forget the whole thing and just put everything into a Roth. With the tIRA, I'd ultimately would be saving a few hundreds in taxes right now in exchange for paying those taxes in the future, after all. Maybe it's not worth the hassle?

Another consideration is that I currently only have a Roth IRA and, hopefully, my income will grow in years to come which means that a Roth would be better once I can no longer deduct Traditional IRA contributions anyway, so the tIRA account will probably end up with only a few thousands of contributions in it. I don't think it'd be too much of a hassle to have a second IRA account just sitting there, but I don't know if that'll cause some issues in the future.

My company recently opened a new location and theyâ€™re looking to transfer people to it temporarily. Itâ€™s going to be for a year or more.

Theyâ€™re promising a promotion at the end of the year and some sort of housing support, but the numbers arenâ€™t available yet.

Iâ€™m tentatively agreeable to this transfer. The new place is in a lower cost of living area, and if thereâ€™s a housing stipend then I can save money on rent. The big issue for me is that Iâ€™m currently making around an extra $4/hr above my regular rate for working a non-standard shift, and Iâ€™m not sure if that will be taken into account if I take this transfer and work a regular shift there. If  hard numbers were available for the benefits then I could math it out, but theyâ€™re not. Then thereâ€™s the promotion to also take into account. That seems intangible to me since itâ€™s a startup and theyâ€™re making up the promotion ladder as they go so I have no idea what the rate increase for next rank would be.

Another issue is that even if I volunteer, I might not be selected if enough other people volunteer as well. I could give a tentative agreement, but what if that lowers my chances of being selected and the benefits end up being really good? Itâ€™s a startup so thereâ€™s no hard and fast rules for what these benefits could beâ€”theyâ€™re making them up as they go as well, but in the past they seem to be generous enough (hence my $4/hr for working a different shift).

I'm about to move out soon, and I'm not entirely sure what to do. Should I just pretend that I never had the pass in the first place?

wim4q9,Mountebank,"How to decide when to splurge more for name-brand or â€œqualityâ€ products?

I want to buy a recliner for my living room, but I canâ€™t decide how much to spend on it. I could get a relatively cheap Chinese knockoff one online for a few hundred dollars, or store-brand one from a brick-and-mortar furniture store for maybe 800-1000, or I could go for something moderately name brand for 1000-2000. The price of these things can keep going up, but I think $2000 is my hard cap.

Iâ€™ve got about $5000 saved up for disposable spending, so whatever I do buy wonâ€™t hurt me financially, but I keep getting this nagging or guilty feeling when I think about spending more than $400.

Hi all, I am simply curious as to whether or not I am being smart with my money and if there are any adjustments or advise you would give. Below is a breakdown of the finances. I am on my phone so please forgive any wonky formatting. 

**Income**
$60,000 annually

Gross Pay: $2316 bi weekly 
Taxes: $463.45 bi weekly
401k: $276.92 bi weekly (12% of income) 

**weekly take home pay** : $1,567.32
**monthly take home pay** : $3,134.64 

**Expenses**
Rent: $0 (live at home)
Phone: $90
Health: $0 (under parents until 26. Currently 26) 
Gas for car: ~$120/month 

**Savings/Banking**
Checking: $3,686.14
Savings: $5869 (1.3% interest down from 1.7%)
Loans: $5869 
401K :$714 (started 2 months ago) 

**Debt**
Federal loans: $15,326 (interest rate 0$ till 9.30.20) 
Private Loan 1: $6,971 (interest rate 6.24%)
Private Loan 2: $7831 (interest rate 5%)

Before Covid, I was taking $700 per paycheck ($1400/month) towards my federal loans. Now, I just put that $700/paycheck into my â€œloansâ€ bank account ($5869). I will continue doing that until Sept 30th and then do a lump sum payment before the interest goes back. Iâ€™m in my grace period now anyway but it gives me an extra month. My mom pays off my private loans around $400-$500 a month. Once I pay off my Fed loans I plan on helping with the remainder of the private to get them gone faster. 

I have a goal of having $10,000 in my savings before I move out anywhere. I live in a high COL area and want to have a 3-6 month backup BEFORE I go out on my own. I started my job back in January so Iâ€™m hoping I can just keep pushing money in the savings account until I hit 10K. Iâ€™m thinking about moving out in Sept to the city, depending on if my friend gets a job so we can be roommates, so I might be able to obtain this goal. If not, Iâ€™ll just continue living at home. If I move out I will probably drop my 401K contribution to a less aggressive number, probably around 10%.

So, I'm looking at renting an apartment with my friend which will save me some time on my commute. But, before we move forward in this, I want to make sure I am financially able to move out before I go and sign a lease. Below is a breakdown of my \*possible\* expenses and my income. 

Monthly income before taxes: Roughly $4,600 (\~60,000 annually) 

401K: $553.84 I pay 12% of my paycheck into my retirement. 

**Income after taxes and 401K: $3,134**

Below are my guestimates on what I think I would spend in a month on certain items. If anyone with real life experience with these prices wants to correct me, please do! I've never lived alone before. 

Rent: : $1200/month. This is after my roommate and I split rent. I live in an extremely HCL area ): 

Food: $300. I don't know how much a single person eats, I know I don't eat very much and I have a lot of experience food shopping. This is my contribution to the household food items. It would probably be less if we both contribute to groceries. 

Utilities: $150/month. For all utilities like gas/water/electric/etc. Again, my contribution. Would probably be less. 

Gas(car): $240/month 

Phone: $90 

\*Loans: $300 

Fun money: $300

Left over: $554/month 

\*Loans: I currently pay $1400 a month to really knock down my loans. When I started making payments 6 months ago, I had $20,000 in loans. I currently have $8,800 left. I will be making $1400 payment until I move out (probably August/September) and I will probably have about $5,300 in loans left. I feel comfortable lowering my payments to $300, which will still be above the minimum. Extra money at the end of the month can go to my loans/savings. 

Savings account: I currently have $6,794 in my savings account. My job expenses my mileage to/from work as well as any tolls. All this money I get expended back to me goes into my savings account. I currently drive 100 miles a day going to work and back and moving will bring it down to about 50. So, every month we can estimate anywhere from $400-$600 dollars going into my savings. I have a goal of 10k. I will probably be at around 8k, maybe more, by the time I move out. I also have about a thousand in cash. 

Am I missing anything? Are any of my estimates grossly over or under estimated? Am I being financially responsible? Can I afford to move out?

Hi all, 

I was wondering if anyone could offer any advice on how to save for a house. I am 24 years old and make $60k a year in a high CoL area. I currently live in an apartment with my roommate that I pay $1257 a month (an amazing price for where I live) which includes gas, water, heat, and garbage. I will probably live on my own for 3-4 years until I transfer to a different branch and will be closer to home and I will try to live at home for a year or two (2 min commute) until I can get a house but,I want a head start. My expenses are as follows:

I put 12% a paycheck a month towards my 401k. After taxes and 401k, I bring home $3000 a month. 

Rent:$1257
Internet: $13.5
Electricity: ~$40
Food: ~$250 
Netflix: $9
Gym(once it opens): ~$20
Phone (moms family plan): $90
Horseback riding: $200 
Vacation Fund: $120 

The rest I distribute to fun money, gas for car, shampoo/conditioner, etc. 

My mileage is expensed through my work. I usually get anywhere from $250-$600 a month in extra money that goes into an emergency fund. Right now, I currently have $7,600 in my savings account (1% interest, was 1.7%.. thanks covid). 
I have a goal of $10,000 in this account. By next pay check Iâ€™ll have about $8300 in there. 
Once this goal of 10k is reached, I would like to save up for a new car. I drive A LOT for my job, sometimes doing interstate travel (400+ miles away) and my car is old. A 2004 Camry with 175k on the engine. I had some engine problems recently, and although fine for driving around town,  I get nervous driving it long distance now and borrow my moms car. Iâ€™d like to get one, probably another Camry, that I can feel more comfortable in driving long distance for work. 

I feel like I have my finances under control atm. However, buying a house is a HUGE investment and I know nothing about it other than having 20% for down payment that Iâ€™ve just been able to start thinking about since my parents paid off the remaining of my loans, as a surprise, ($7800) after I already paid off $12,000.

He would get $1,632 now at 67, and $2,030 if he waited until 70.     
So keeping the variables fixed, heâ€™d be giving up $58,752 from 67-70, to earn another $398 a month.

My SO bought a house a year and a half ago with cash. They received the money from their mom with a promissory note attached, basically a written note that said she pay her back in a year, when she had access to half her trust fund.   
So a year later, she had access to her trust fund, and withdrew 800K to pay her mom back.   
Now she's wondering how to go about reporting the 800K withdrawal and the payment to her mom for tax purposes. Does she even need to? In terms of the taxes on her trust fund, her mother is set to pay everything related to those accounts, she does so for all of her children.

Im a bit at a loss at what to do, my mother just approached me with some information yesterday. She has a life insurance plan that she pays monthly. The life insurance plan is the kind that, after a long period, the cash value ends up being higher than the total premiums paid.    
She started the plan in 2002, and has paid a $150 monthly premium since. The coverage is for $150K death benefit, and maturity date is 2060, so long after sheâ€™ll pass. My mom has a couple health issues, largest being diabetes, but I am hoping she will be around at least until my kids are adults, another twenty years or so, which I think is definitely possible.    
At this point, she still only has 2 years to go before breaking even, and after that, the cash value should start growing slightly faster than the premium payments. I believe something like 35k cash value at the moment.       
My parents do not make a lot of money, and no retirement accounts, they will be living off of Social Security once they retire in three years.   
They do luckily have their condo, which thanks to CA inflation, has turned into a $500K home, but they still have $100K mortgage.     
Which leads me to my questions. Should she cancel and take the cash value and invest the money?

Based on the flowchart it is recommended for me to put this in a Roth IRA which I do have and had originally planned on doing, but then I started thinking, what are the conservative returns on things like Bond Indexes, Gold, etc. (various conservative investments)?

The alternative is I put the extra money onto my mortgage (3.25%) which is not much better than a savings account but would diversify me more into Real Estate vs Cash.

I learned that Vanguard doesn't do Target Date Funds (at least not any that my 401k plan allows) but instead I could use their ""Growth"", ""Moderate Growth"", ""Conservative"", and  ""Income"" plans to basically mimic a target date fund, I would just need to reallocate between these plans over time, which is completely fine with me.

The question I have is starting now at 26 I would want to be 100% in the Growth fund which is VASGX. So would it make more sense to switch to that or just stick with my existing Target Date fund?

For a bit more detail, I am NOT considering this reallocation because of anything currently happening in the market, I know times are weird and I believe either option would work just fine for me.

My lease ends in September and due to a few different circumstances I need to move out and into a different complex. I have a dog and a while back she chewed some of the baseboards in my apartment (she was a puppy). I have done my best to repair the baseboards; wood filler, dremel and paint. Its quite good but I would understand if my apartment complex isn't satisfied.

I paid a $99 security deposit and a $300 ""Dog Fee"" at move-in.

There are 3 lines from my lease that apply here:

1. ""Resident Agrees to repair and pay for damages and costs associated with bringing the Premises back to the level of an animal free status upon move-out \[goes on to explain possibility of carpet replacement, etc. but no mention of baseboards specifically\]
2. ""To immediately pay for any injury, damage, loss or expense caused by the animal."" (Which I suppose I already screwed up since the damage was done over a year ago)
3. (Paraphrasing because this one is obvious) ""Resident will not receive the security deposit back if damage to property beyond normal wear and tear is evident""

I in no way expect to get my security deposit back (not because of significant damage, but just because I know apartment complexes can be a bit 'difficult' at move out). But if my $99 security deposit is not enough in their eyes do I wait until my landlord says I owe money to pay them the extra? Do I go ahead and report the damage now?

I'll keep this as short as I can, my Grad school will cost a total of $14,000 broken down as:

I make enough money that if I live at BARE minimum I can afford to pay for each semester in cash (starting with spending all of my $4,000 in cash to start with here in about a month). So I would essentially be spending down my entire checking account and replenishing it each semester.

So my question is this, do I continue with this plan or would you recommend I go get a student loan at \~6% and rapidly pay it off?

From quick math that I did (and correct me if this looks wrong) if I were to pay the loan off in 3 years (1 year after graduating) that loan would have cost me about $300-$400 in interest.

kptdwz,multicm,"Pay off Debt or Higher Down Payment?

I am lining myself up to buy a house in December 2021 (the end of my apartment lease). I am spending the next 11 months saving for the house (I already have some money set aside for this, I am just adding to it).

I have 2 existing debts: 

* Student Loans (4.9%) which will be $7,500 in December 2021 
* Ashley furniture Line (0%) which will be $3,000 in December 2021

My question is, when December comes around I will have roughly $24,000 saved up for a house (This is outside my emergency fund). The homes I am looking at are around $220,000. Should I pay off my debt, having a better debt-to-income ratio, and put less down on a house or maintain my debt to put more down on the house?",Yes,Yes,No,No,No
lo7azr,multicm,"How Much House to Buy?

I know these questions are asked on here hundreds of times a day and I apologize for adding to that list...

I and 24 and currently make $66,000 a year and I currently have $13,000 in house savings for a down payment. I live in a MCOL town with ""standard"" 3/2 homes around $260k. If I don't mind a 30-minute commute I could probably get that figure down to $230k. Honestly, I do not like any of these $220-240k homes I have seen, they all feel small and dated and the apartment I rent for $900/month (my portion of rent with a roommate) is much nicer, but I want to get into the market and stop paying rent, so I am prepared to buy whatever I can afford. Based on my budget I believe I can routinely afford $1,700/month in fixed housing costs (Mortgage, PMI, HOA, etc.). That would be 30% of my income. I just want to see if that is an acceptable amount.

Few things:

1. I have very minimal debt: $70/month to a 0% interest financing credit card. And I will have $7,000 in student loans when I graduate grad school in June 2022 (I'll come back to this at the end)
2. I am currently living under a budget where I am spending $900/month on rent and saving $1,200 a month for a house and an additional $300/month in E-Fund savings. And this budget doesn't feel tight; I can continue to live like this. So That would mean once I have a house my rent+house savings of $2,100 can now be reallocated as $1,700 to housing costs and an additional $400/month to E-Fund because I know homeownership can be expensive.
3. I am single but will have a roommate (not that his rent will be used in calculating what I can afford)

On the topic of my master's degree, it may be quick to assume I should just wait the 15 months and get a house when I graduate, but there is one thing to note there. My employer has informed me they intend to give me a sizeable raise when I graduate. By the personelle policy, I will get 7% at a minimum. But they also told me when I graduate I will be promoted to ""Data Scientist"" and will be given a salary for this position as is standard in my area and industry. My research on Glassdoor has provided me with $90k as a starting data scientist salary. With my 4 years of work experience with this company, I believe I may be getting a bit more than that. But the reason I say all this is, I want a house before getting this promotion. I don't want to allow that lifestyle creep by looking at houses I will be able to afford when I am making $90k+. So I would rather get a house I can afford now and enjoy the extra income in a year. With that said, I am comfortable will going on the high range of ""affordable"" for my current budget for this exact reason.

Does $1,700 a month seem right, or is there something I am missing? And how much house can I expect to afford at $1,700 a month with a  30 year mortgage?",No,Yes,No,Yes,No
m7w1h7,multicm,"How to calculate debt to Income when buying a House as a Student

I have 2 debts, a furniture credit card which has 0% interest and I pay $70/month, and student loans with a current balance of $5,500. I make $67k a year. My issue is I am currently in graduate school and my student loans are for this degree so I am not paying anything on the loans until I graduate (especially since the interest is deferred for COVID). I graduate May 2022 and then I will start making payments. And to make matters worse the student loans will still increase for 2 more semesters (roughly $2,500 a semester).

I am looking to buy a place in the next 6-ish months, I have the necessary down payment and emergency savings. So when they are calculating my debt to income how will they handle my student loans? I don't know what my monthly payment is because I currently don't have one. And I know they say to not do ANYTHING debt related while closing on a house, but what happens if I am closing around august and now need to pay for another semester ($2,500), I could just pay that semester in cash, but no reason to do that if I don't have to since it is 0% interest through at least October.

I posted here a couple days ago that I am closing on a house June 1st and I am crunching some numbers and they are not quite making sense to me. I have no debt, and do not ""expect"" any debt going forward (new car already paid off, no children, and already graduated). After running the numbers, when I buy this house I will have 35% DTI, which is good in the eyes of the Wiki. But the hiccup is the house I am looking at is 4.6x my income which is a big no-no in the Wiki which suggests 3-4x income (I am in a low property tax state). Now I do have some other stuff to pad this, like I will have a roommate (But that income is not factored into that 4.6x figure, with this additional income I am looking at 4x).

After making a budget with this new housing costs (I already got the breakdown from my lender, so I included PMI, Home Insurance, HOA, mortgage, etc.) I am left with $650 a month which I can save and that is on top of my retirement and not including any income from a roommate. I believe being able to save $650 a month is well within the realm of ""affordable"".

nfbcb0,multicm,"Understanding the balance between better life for kids and better retirement

I am not having any children anytime soon, I don't even have a girlfriend, but I got into a discussion with some family this week and I wanted to get some input from this subreddit.

Growing up I was very fortunate to have the parents I did, they are great people, but more related to the question at hand, they spent lavishly on my brother and I when we were young, Disney vacations, cruises, etc. I traveled a lot when I was a kid and I never thought anything of it financially but I knew I was fortunate. Well fast forward 20 years and I have a better picture of what was going on, my dad is in good shape but could have been in much better shape. Basically he makes good money, has minimal debt, but his retirement is less than I would have expected him to have for the money he makes. And this is all due to the money he spent when my brother and I were young. Entire vacations were on credit cards. His philosophy was he would take care of finances once we moved out, which he did, but of course minimal retirement contributions when he was younger has had a lasting impact.

So my question for everyone who has/had children is, how do you determine this balance? I believe I was shaped, for the better, by the lavish trips we took when I was younger, I saw a lot of this country and I had a very happy childhood. I would love to give the same to my kids one day, but I don't think I want to be as risky as my parents were.

I have my mortgage with a credit union and when I go to make a payment it asks me if this is a regular payment or a principal-only payment. Obviously, they need to make their interest money so why is this even an option? If I owe accrued interest why would they allow me to pay principal only?

At first I thought I entered something wrong but that isn't the case so is TurboTax wrong or right?...

I bought my house June 1st and my friend starting renting from me (25% of the house) on the same day.

He has paid $800/mo so $5,600 total

After entering that information and telling turbo tax that I am renting out 25% of my house and then adding in all of the Propery Tax, Utilities, HOA, Mortgage Interest, and Mortgage Insurance (25% of all) Turbo Tax says I only owe something in double digits (like $25).

How can this be correct?

My question is, aren't all employer-matched plans already diversified? It is my understanding that all (or almost all) employer matches are pre-tax. So I just contribute 100% to Roth with the expectation that in retirement I will withdraw my employer contributions at the low bracket and mine will be tax-free. Instant diversification.

Our family will pay off our home loan this summer and the home is currently valued around 200k. We are going to enjoy no mortgage payment for a few years but may upgrade in a few years as our family grows and we have a clearer picture of our job situations. 

My question is: When we upgrade, shold we save/invest the extra equity received in the sale of the home and put down a standard 20%? If we reinvested the home equity, it would likely be more than that percentage. 

For example:

$ from sale of home: let's say $190k when all is said and done 

New home: $300k lower end, $400k higher

I initially held the stance that something like a 70/30 stock/bond mix made sense given that it is relatively aggressive but also diversifies with bonds and (in more ""normal"" circumstances not like last year) will counteract losses when the market is down. Reverse correlation. 

However, knowing that bond index funds are less tax efficient and, in the long run, will more often than not mean lower overall returns than 100% stock index, is it really worthwhile to include them?

I know that the conventional wisdom is to keep feeding the brokerage account regardless of what the market is doing.

vqqap8,NateCooper2,"Roth IRA recharacterization for 2021 questions

Hello! I'm still lost on what/where I report on form 8606 for 2021 taxes. Any help is much appreciated!

**About me:**

* I contributed $6,000 to my Roth IRA in 2021. However, I made above the Roth IRA income limits (whoops!). So I need to fix it. 

* I recharacterized the Roth contribution + earnings = $6,788 from the Roth IRA to a Traditional IRA in 2022 for 2021 taxes.   

* Then I converted the $6,788 from the Traditional IRA back to my Roth IRA in 2022. Ending Traditional IRA balance = $0.

* I got an extension for 2021 taxes


**Hereâ€™s my progress so far and questions:**

* 1) I need to report the Roth recharacterization on Form 8606 for 2021 taxes as if it were a regular non-deductible Traditional IRA contribution for 2021. I'm just not sure what lines I report the $6,000 on Form 8606. What else do I need to include on Form 8606? 

* 2) Do I need to report the Roth conversion (when I moved the $6,788 from the Traditional IRA and back to the Roth IRA) in 2021 taxes? If so, what lines do I report on Form 8606? 

* 3) Do I need to report the original $6,000 Roth IRA contribution that I made in 2021? If so, how/where?

* 4) After doing this, did I fix my mistake in the eyes of the IRA?

Thank you!",Yes,Yes,No,Yes,No
vrcjv8,NateCooper2,"Reporting Roth IRA recharacterization

Hello! Any help is much appreciated!

**About me:**

* I contributed $6,000 to my Roth IRA in 2021. But I earned over the Roth IRA MAGI limit. To fix this mistake, in 2022 I recharacterized $6,788 (original contribution plus earnings) to a traditional IRA for 2021 tax year. I then converted the full $6,788 back to the Roth IRA in 2022. Ending Traditional IRA balance = $0.

* I filled out $6,000 on lines 1, 3, and 14 on Form 8606 to report the recharacterization and included a statement.

**Questions:**

* 1) Do I need to report the $788 earnings somewhere for 2021 taxes? If so, what form and lines?

* 2) Am i missing anything else? Do I need to report anything on form 1099-R? (e.g. early distribution penalty?)

159xvei,Nateddog21,"Looking for the best way to pay off the rest of my car loan by next year if possible.

Monthly pay after tax: roughly $3200 or about $1650 semi monthly(I changed some things around but that's a pretty close pay)

Bills fluctuate due to the electricity bill especially during the summer so let's say: $1300. 
Other than bills I pay maybe $150 for food a month. 

$200 credit card limit right now I used $109.47. It doesn't get maxed out. 

My car Note is $378.90 @17.93% due end of the month. I owe 9543.04 on the car. 

All of bills except the car loan are due when I get my first check on the 15th so when I post those I'll have over $500 left. Then when I get my last check of the month I just pay the car loan which will leave me with over $1100. 

Personally I was thinking I could add an extra $500 to the principle when I pay the loan at the end of the month. 

Is that too much? How long would it take to pay off if I did that so you think? I'm terrible at math.",Yes,Yes,No,Yes,No

I had to roll over some debt from my last vehicle into the current one and Iâ€™m paying 675 a month. I was getting reimbursed 425 by my previous employer but Iâ€™m not any more. 

I just spoke with my leasing company and they gave me a few options ranging from 36-75 months on a finance contract and the interest rate is identical for all of them at 5.49% oddly.  

Total amount financed for each would be around 32,000 given these calculations. I could always put  money down too. For 60 months the payment was just shy of my current one at 617; total interest paid was around 4700. For 72 the payment is 529 and total interest paid is right around 5720.

lzhhxi,Nblearchangel,"What is your personal strategy for saving for ""want"" expenses.

I for the first time successfully planned out and executed a savings strategy. I was just getting out of a LTR a year ago and needed a laptop suddenly.  I was unemployed at the time and couldn't afford anything decent and so I bought the cheapest thing I possibly could.  I was able to stay at home with my mom for a while to save money and I planned on saving for a real computer in the future.  And so I did.  I used my debit card and it's built in savings feature where it moves 1$ every time I make a transaction to my savings.  I have a lot of credit card debt and it gave me an incentive to never use the cards.  I felt like I was being productive in a lot of ways.  Now I have a great job and used all that saved cash (plus a little of my tax refund) to fund a new computer now that I've moved into my own place.  This is a big win for me.

Last night I also decided to hit the casino for the first time in several years.  I'm really good at poker and I felt like, because I've been exceptionally diligent at making my own meals and only eating out 1x a week (whether that's with friends or coworkers or because I forgot lunch) I deserved to treat myself.  I've had an exceptionally good run at work (several large commission checks in a row) and I told myself that I would put every dollar I won towards my Amex.  Well, it didn't work out as planned and I was up until I wasn't.  Happens.  But now I want to replicate my savings goals from the computer into new goals.

But I was also hoping to hear from you about how you structure your savings plans. How do you plan for your leisure expenses?  Do you have several savings accounts you contribute to every paycheck? Do you simply budget a set amount every month?  Do you contribute 5-10$ every time you forgo a typical expense like a coffee or a planned lunch?  Do you contribute to your account when you buy the less expensive version of something you really wanted?

Let me know.  I'd love to hear from you.",Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes,No

p8ehzu,Nblearchangel,"Interviewing at multiple firms and I need to set priorities

Currently, my existing employer is talking about promoting me but I put in some apps several weeks ago. Iâ€™m 35 and unsatisfied with career prospects where I am now because management just doesnâ€™t know how to develop people. Itâ€™s a young firm. 

The promotion theyâ€™re proposing would be from an entry level role to a management role. A big jump for sure, however, Iâ€™m extremely uncertain how much theyâ€™ll be willing to pay me. Based on expectations Iâ€™d be making less than I could make elsewhere but I definitely wonâ€™t be able to get manager on my resume anywhere else. 

Thing is, Iâ€™m finally hearing back from those apps I put in. Iâ€™ve heard back from two in particular both of which are massive companies, Salesforce and Deloitte, and I imagine Iâ€™d get proper career training/development at either. The only things I learn in my current role are things I seek out on my own, and even then the learning opportunities are sparse. Thereâ€™s just so few resources where I am. 

Iâ€™m jumping the gun a little and I havenâ€™t gotten an offer at either place but I want to leverage this opportunity. Do I wave an offer letter around to my boss demanding more than they planned on paying me?  In the event I get an offer I imagine it would be significantly higher than my new promotion would pay. And the thing is, once I get locked into my new management role there wonâ€™t be any pay growth for a very long time. They donâ€™t exactly do COLAâ€™s where I am. Lol

I know this is a bit broad but I was hoping to hear some perspective from people that have been in similar situations. The WLB where I am now is unparalleled but I have so much debt. Soooooo much debt and I need more income. I donâ€™t want to be a slave to this forever. So with that in mind, what are your thoughts?

Please hear me out before you scoff. Long story short, I auto-pay all my utilities. The cost compared to income at this point just doesn't matter..... **until it does**.

To skip my back story, last year I made life changing money for my family, and I have really started to resonate with Dave Ramsey (donâ€™t know the general consensus anymore for him, but whatever). He suggests, as you should, focus on paying down all debt to get a fresh start and to start what he calls the baby steps. Problem is, with our income last year, we jumped all the way to the end goal and now I have to figure out how to work backwards.   
  
To be brief, the only debt we have is our two vehicles (combined loan value of ~$69k, both brand new), a camper ($11k) and the house mortgage ($150k @ about 3.5%); outside of this, we are debt free (credit cards paid monthly, etc)   
  
As far as assets go, not including value in the house or cars we have:  
$120k 401k
$500k HYSA (money market)
$620k individual brokerage 
  
So at this point, do we just really drain the HYSA and start over 100% debt free? It seems like a unreal situation but my current job cannot support our current monthly expenses without dipping into savings at the current moment due to life creep (I ran a business last year that blew up and subsequently have stopped almost cold turkey from the shock for the last 6 months).

So I have some money that Iâ€™m planning on using early next year for a house down payment that Iâ€™m wanting to grow safely. 

It seems like Treasury Bills are a safe way to do this.

2.	Those auctions tend to be 4-5% on 4 week bills. 
3.	If I buy 4 week bills, I only lose access to the funds for 4 weeks at a time? 
4.	After the four weeks, if I donâ€™t reinvest the funds + profits are automatically re-deposited into my account ?

Hi all. Unsure how much house we should be looking for, so hereâ€™s a breakdown. 


Income: 

Before taxes and deductions, about 10k a month. With bonuses and her OT, we hit 130-140k a year pre tax. 

We have about 80k in the bank right now (just bought a car), so Iâ€™m not sure what kind of down payment we can afford while still maintaining an emergency fund. If we continue saving until summer (when Iâ€™m hoping to find a place), we should be able to save another 20k or so. 

Hard expenses: 

Cars : $900 (insurance and payments for two cars. Weâ€™re still young so insurance is expensive) 

Student Loans: $450 a month 

Roth Contributions ($1000 a month) 


For things like food, clothes, and incidentals I donâ€™t really budget. We just try to spend as little as possible and go without to save money. Weâ€™ve been saving like 5-6k a month as this point since we have no housing expenses and very limited other expenses.

Hi all.

I work 100% remote and can live anywhere. My fiancÃ©e is an RN and can pretty much find a job anywhere. 

We are a little conflicted on where to buy a house and are not sure how to approach this. We met in college (Chicago) and then moved back to my hometown (Cleveland) to try and save up for a house / pay off some student loans. By the time weâ€™re ready to buy, Iâ€™m aiming to have 80k saved up and ready to go for a down payment. 

It seems like in this area (Cleveland), you can get something decent for 300-350k whereas in the Chicagoland suburbs youâ€™re going to be more like 350-400k. Iâ€™m happy where we are at, but we miss our friends from school. Most of the people we know here have moved away. My worry is that Iâ€™m not sure if a 350-400k house is too much for us to take on right now.

Background:  I'm an early 50s divorced male with two kids that will both be off to university late this summer.  There are no savings specifically earmarked for our kids' education and all of our assets were divided equally in our divorce a few years ago.  Here's my current financial scenario:

*I own a home worth $2 million with about $285k left on my 3.125% 30-year mortgage.  My monthly mortage payments are about $1,300/month.

*I have about $180k in my Schwab retirement account allocated mostly to target date 2035 index funds (SWYFX).

*I own my car and have no other debt other than normal monthly expenses.

*After paying taxes last month I have about $20k remaining in cash in a bank money market account that is there to cover monthly expenses and serve as an emergency fund.

*I started my own LLC a year ago and make around $100k per year.  My first client is having significant supply issues so my contract with them is extremely unstable right now.  I updated my resume today and am going to begin looking for new client(s) immediately.

*I realize that I am not well-positioned for a normal retirement horizon right now and that I'll likely have to sell my home at some point to be able to do that.  I live in a metro area where real estate is absolutely insane, so I view my home equity as my eventual retirement, not the modest about I have in my IRAs.  I live well within my means, haven't been on a real vacation in many years, drive a 2011 Chevy with low miles, shop frugally, dine out rarely, etc.  I am very happy with what I currently have and my home is my happy place.

My ex and I have met with the financial teams at each of the universities that our boys will be attending.  Both will be taking the maximum federal student loan amounts of $5,500 and we have enough GET units to mostly cover each of their first semesters.  My parents are going to be kicking in $2k each which I will deposit into bank accounts that I will establish for each boy and will use this money for payments to the schools.  Beyond that it looks like there is a gap of approximately $5,000/month over the college months total between the two, so we're going to have to come up with a game plan to close this gap.

Assuming a 50/50 split of this burden between my ex and me, and also assuming that I accept this burden, that's $2,500/month that I will be on the hook for, and I don't have that kind of pad in my earnings.  The Parent Plus loan is one option, and I've also begun brainstorming others such as a private loan, line of credit, or HELOC.  Given the interest rate on my mortgage compared to current market I'm guessing that a cash-out re-fi isn't going to be an attractive option for me.  Though we likely won't be having to make any significant payments until the first of next year (as a result of our GET units), I'm motivated to begin making decisions on this now as a result of my LLC client being very unstable.  If a worst-case scenario happens and my client doesn't renew my contract with me and I have difficulty finding a new client I don't want any lending institution refusing my loan request as a result.

So I'm trying to decide what to do here and am experiencing a lot of anxiety about this.  I knew college was going to be expensive but I didn't anticipate this much of gap between their federal student loans  and overall total cost.  I would be very appreciative of any advice given to me for the best game plan to move forward.

I will almost certainly have to sell and downsize my house some day to be able to retire, but for reasons too broad to list here that is not currently an option.  I make about $100k annually as sole owner of my service LLC.

Both of my boys will be maxing out their $5,500 annual federal student loan and will both be receiving financial aid and scholarships, but there is still a significant gap remaining that will need to be funded.  Their mom and I have agreed to fund this gap out of our deep love for them, and it looks like I'm going to be on the hook for approximately $80k total over the course of four years.

I'm trying to determine whether I use IRA funds in my Schwab account to pay for this, as I understand that there are no penalties if the IRA is used to pay for higher education, or if I should instead take a Parent Plus or personal loan (whether it be a line of credit or HELOC).  I'm wondering if it would make sense to speak with a CPA or financial advisor about this decision, but was hoping to receive some initial guidance here before proceeding.",Yes,Yes,No,Yes,No

p5nlca,No7onelikeyou,"New to investing! Roth IRA vs Taxable account question

Hello! I donâ€™t know everything, not even close, so please excuse me if this is an â€œeasyâ€ question to answer. 

When it comes to investing long term, most think maxing out a Roth IRA is fantastic, due to the tax benefits, especially when someone is a little older and can take it out completely tax free (59 and a half years old). 

Due to the annual contribution limit, is it designed to be that way? As far as the big compound interest not really taking effect until years and years. Why is there a limit anyway? They donâ€™t want someone having too much? I mean isnâ€™t a $6k limit per year small? Once someone is 50 then it goes to $7k, but I mean thatâ€™s at 50 years old.

Anyway, I was then looking up info on a taxable brokerage account, from my understanding, there is NO contribution limit. Talk about a night and day difference! Despite the taxes. 

Since time is HUGE when it comes to investing, isnâ€™t it best to put in as much as possible, with as much time left as possible? 

For these two examples, $180,000 is the total. I used a compound interest calculator at investor.org. 

$0 initially. $500/monthly for 30 years at 8%. Just over $679,000 is the total after all that time. Thatâ€™s for $6,000/year

Compared to $180,000 at once. As well as $0/month, for 30 years at 8% as well, the total comes out to be over a million dollars more lol 
. A little bit over $1,811,000. 

So despite the taxes, would it be best to put in as much as possible into a taxable account due to the compound interest and time? Where as even with taxes, the amount â€œtake homeâ€ would still be higher? 

If someone can invest $15,000/year...instead of $6,000/year in to the Roth and $9,000 into a taxable, wouldnâ€™t they be better off putting in all $15,000 in to the taxable? Not as beneficial tax wise, but how do you factor in the amount being much higher since so much is being put in, with the compound interest going crazy even early on, especially then with so much time left? 

A Roth IRA sounds great, but is someone better off putting in more elsewhere, thanks to it being a higher total amount compared to dividing up among accounts? 

Thanks for any info!",Yes,Yes,No,Yes,No

Earned income is needed for a Roth IRA, compared to not being needed for a brokerage account. I just donâ€™t really understand how it works since the $ for a Roth IRA doesnâ€™t always come from someoneâ€™s job? 

As in, Roth IRA deductions arenâ€™t deducted from anyones paycheck/not work related at all, other than the $ needing to be earned 

If someone goes paycheck to paycheck, but for some reason has $18,000 sitting at home for their Roth IRA contributions... Then they could use that for 2021,2022, and 2023 contributions, as long as they earned $6,000 or more, despite the $ having nothing to do with work.

104z5zo,NoGimmicks,"I was hired as a salaried employee but my paystub is treating me as an hourly employee and adding OT hours I never worked to make my amount paid accurate.

I am a salaried employee in New York State with an annual salary of $80k. I worked three full days in my first pay period. 8 hours - 1hr lunch break = 7 hours paid per day. 

My paystub should say I worked 21 hours @43.956/hr =$923.07


Instead it says:

Regular: 24hrs @ 21.98
Overtime: 12hrs @32.97

Total: $923.07

While the total amount is correct Iâ€™m concerned about why they processed my pay in this way. There is also ambiguous language in the employee handbook that makes me think I will only accrue
hours during my â€œregularâ€ hours worked and not OT. That would still be fine if it wasnâ€™t for the fact that the payroll person told me whenever she puts in a day for PTO the system takes out 12 hours of accrued PTO. 

That only makes sense if both my regular and OT hours accrue at the same rate. 

The payroll person called it the 80/40 rule. She mentioned thereâ€™s a handful of us salaried workers who are treated this way and that it was explained to her at some point but she still doesnâ€™t get it. The Administrator called it the 8/2 or 8/4 rule so it sounds like heâ€™s not fully sure either how it works. 

I donâ€™t get what the point of this system is. How does it help the company? And if it helps the company is it at the expense of my PTO?

The administrator called the corporate payroll person and left a message. Heâ€™s supposed to call us in when they call back for a meeting. 

What questions or concerns should I bring up? 

Im wondering if they are changing my clock in and clock out times to jive with the amount of hours my paystub is claiming I worked. Or am I getting ripped off on pto? We ran into another employee who is treated as 80/40 and she is confused herself. She also seems to believe that when you file taxes you get more taken out from overtime pay.

Hi all, Iâ€™m looking for advice on what percentage of my income should be going towards retirement and saving up for a down payment. 

Iâ€™m starting a new job at $75k per year. I have $5k in savings right now. My first goal is to hit $10k for a small nest egg. My parents are my landlords so I can get away with a smaller nest egg than most if I fall on hard times.

I have $19k in federal student debts, otherwise no debts. Car paid off in December. 

I can cut back on spending if needed, my main question is what % of my paycheck should I contribute to my 401k to allow me to save for retirement, but also let me purchase a house by the age of 40. If not sooner. We would probably be looking at a home around $900k.",No,Yes,No,Yes,No

o6opip,NoGimmicks,"How to factor rental income in determining how much house one can afford?

My partner and I current pay $7200 a year in rent and are aiming to save $40k a year specifically for a down payment. This equates to us ""spending"" ~$4500 a month in housing. Theoretically we could afford a $4500 a month mortgage, but we want to minimize risk in case of job loss or expensive emergencies. We plan on putting 20% down on a 30-year mortgage, but try our best to pay off early.

&amp;nbsp;

There are a few scenarios that we are considering and could use input on:

&amp;nbsp;

(A) 800k singe family = ~$3900 monthly mortgage payment. We would save $600 a month ($7,200 a year) from our current housing rate for emergencies/paying off early. 

&amp;nbsp;

(B) Single family home for $650-750k =mortgage of ~$3500 a month. We would save ~$1000  a month ($12,000 a year) from our current housing rate for emergencies/paying off early. 

&amp;nbsp;

(C) Two family home for $800k-900k. = ~$4300 monthly mortgage payment. 

&amp;nbsp;



The average rental price in my area for a 1BR is $2000. If we estimate charging $1800 a month for rent and occupancy 9 out of 12 months a year we would have $16,200 of rental income. 

We would also still be saving $200 a month ($2400 a year) from out current housing rate.

That equals $18,600 a year for emergencies/paying off early.

o9u5rn,NoGimmicks,"My parents have a severely underfunded retirement account but own and live in an income producing property. What's the best plan for retirement?

My parents have less than $20k in retirement accounts and ~$25k in savings. They took out a $30k loan from family to pay off the house a couple of months ago. Based on their previous mortgage payments, property/rental taxes, I calculate they will now be netting $20k a year from the rental income. 

My dad has always worked physical jobs and has recently been having knee and back issues. He is ready to retire yesterday, but his goal is to hang in there 2 more years. I am thinking he should use those two years of full-time work to open and max out Roth IRAs for himself and my mom. If all goes according to plan in two years the $30k loan will be paid off while maxing out the Roths. After that he can transition to a part-time job or a full-time job that is less demanding so he can continue to max out the Roth IRAs and the rental income will pay for regular bills.

Five years from now he will be 60 and my mom 63 and they will have a paid off house, $70k in their Roths (+ growth hopefully) and my two younger siblings that live with them now should be starting their own careers be able to survive on their own by then.

They can then sell the house which is currently valued at $1.28 million on zillow and the owner of the house next door offered $900k 3 years ago without even stepping inside. Barring a huge market crash in the next 5 years they may be able to sell for $1mill and buy a single family home in a lower cost of living area for under $300k. After closing costs, fees, taxes, etc I'm hoping they have at least $550k leftover. 

**What kind of tax implications are there if they took that $550k and stuck it in a taxable brokerage account all at once and began to withdraw from it annually for retirement ?**

If they have $600k at retirement (taxable account + roth + tiny 401k) and follow the 4% rule they will have $24k a year to live off of to start. I think they can manage with a paid off home and no other debt. There will also be some sort of social security coming in and with three children we can help fill in the gaps if we have to.

**TL;DR** at the bottom  

I currently owe $18,200 in student loans. No car payments, mortgage, or credit card debt. I have ~$4000 set aside for student loans and contribute $300 weekly to that account, so in one years time I should have $19,000+ and be able to pay off the loans in full.

The reason I'd rather pay it all off at the end of year rather than making large monthly payments throughout the year is that my emergency fund is very depleted and I would feel more secure having access to cash from the student loan account until I can rebuild my emergency fund.

I'm a person that spends less with credit cards than cash and once I call and downgrade my CSP card after the first year, none of my cards have annual fees. If the lookback period for ""recently opened cards"" is two years than this last card should fall off by January 2024. 

I am getting married in May 2022 so I took on a part-time job to cashflow wedding/honeymoon costs. I am unsure if I want to continue with the job after the wedding and I'm not sure if it may hurt my mortgage application. My part-time job was my full time job from August 2017-October 2020 (although my first year was at 1 location and then years 2-3 was at another location with separate payroll). I left in October in 2020 and returned in July 2021 as part-time.

**I've read that banks want to see 2 year of employment, if I took a break from the part-time job after the wedding would it hurt me if I haven't reached two consecutive years of employment by the time my wife and I are applying for a home loan in 2024? Does the fact that its my part-time job and not full-time make this question moot?**

I started my full-time job in March 2021 after being unemployed from October 2020-February 2021 and anticipate remaining with my current employer until mortgage time.

Regarding my DTI, its currently at 9% when only factoring in my full-time salary and no student loan payments. When payments restart it'll be ~13%. With the part-time job factored in then my DTI improves.

Once I'm married and the student loan is paid off our combined DTI would be ~8% or better depending on if I'm working part-time or either of us gets raises.

BTW I hope I'm calculating DTI correctly. As I understood it the only debt I have is rent + student loans. Don't have any car or personal loans and all credit cards are current.

enaaj3,NoHinAmherst,"Advice for my M-I-L: Rent or Buy

My mother in law is at a crossroads. She got out of a bad situation where her husband unexpectedly died without insurance, leaving her in a huge house with hundreds of thousands of dollars of debt, including $50k on credit cards, a new car loan, and liens on the home. Sheâ€™s 70 and collecting social security, but also working, making ~$45,000 a year.

She got out of that mess, sold the house, used the equity to pay down debt, and eliminate the liens, paid off half of her car, and rented a home by paying for a year in advance. The year is almost up and she has to decide: rent or buy?

Her monthly from SS is $2,500. She has $10k remaining on the card, but is floating that to keep her liquid assets until she makes this decision. She has $80,000 in the bank. Her rent is too much ($2,000), but she wants to buy a home thatâ€™s $300,000 (I canâ€™t convince her to look at houses for less) and use $60k down to lower the payment and avoid PMI.

I like the idea of her buying simply because if she runs out of money she will have the equity rather than some landlord, but thereâ€™s something to be said about not eliminating that lump sum of liquidity. Renting for a number of years will probably never put her in the position to own again, but she will have emergency money. Sheâ€™s in fine health, but sheâ€™s 70.

Iâ€™m looking at interest rates, letters Iâ€™m getting with offers, and weighing my options.

And of course, the wife wants a new kitchen (quote: infinity...ignore this portion).

Iâ€™m looking for feedback about what things to look out for when asking around, what tricks I should avoid if I consider a refi or second mortgage or HELOC.

Some info: 
- My mortgage rate is currently 3.5%. I have 26 years remaining, though I had been paying it as a 15 year.
- We plan to live here forever, though thatâ€™s dependent upon work.
- My credit is 806-849 depending on the agency.
- My mortgage owed is about $300,000 on a $409,000 mortgage and the home value average estimate is around $460,000.
- No debt other than the mortgage and my car payment of $360 which ends in two weeks!
- Liquid capital: $70,000 (7 month safety net).

I could just as easily leave all of these repairs and improvements until the wheels fall off, Iâ€™m not itching. I just donâ€™t want to miss an opportunity to make these repairs when my credit is high and rates are low, when it could cost me a lot more at a later date.

Ideally, Iâ€™d like to get the magical scenario where my payment is the same or close to what it is now, due to a lower rate, but also put equity to use to fix and update the home.

Georgia, USA

I had a score of 849 for a while and used that to refinance my house in October/November. 

With that score the following was and remains true: credit cards paid off completely every month, no car loan, no debt, no student loans, always paid on time for 20+ years, oldest account is 15+ years, only two credit cards*, no dings of any sort.

The only thing I changed was I took advantage of a Delta skymiles card to get 75,000 miles in late December.

ok73h1,NoHinAmherst,"Looking for a solution to a stupid problem I created with the IRS

This tax year was different for my family, as it was for many others. I typically owe money at the end of the year, but due to a loss of income during the pandemic from my wife who is a real estate agent (1099-NEC) and suddenly had to spend much more time working out of the house with our two kids, we were owed a refund. My refund was something like $5,606 and, as it turns out, this matters.

I filed early, around Feb or March, and my return was accepted. I file with multiple states, so I always check my bank accounts to make sure that the refunds come in and just as importantly, the checks owed to another state were cashed by that state. Within two weeks, I saw a direct deposit of $5,606 and that my MA check was deposited. Great! But then a couple weeks later I noticed that the IRS deposited $3,727.94 a day or two after my refund AND another deposit of $1,873.06 around a week later.

What were these two amounts? My taxes were complete, and these random totals were confusing. Refunds should be rounded to a dollar amount anyway, so why the $0.06 or $0.94? Those add up to a dollar! Wait, those two checks add up to $5,600 when combined. Did the IRS just pay me twice? Am I about to get a third check for $6?

A Google search told me that sometimes the IRS might make a double payment by mistake, and if that's the case, you better not keep it. They may take a long time to notice, but when they do, you'll owe it WITH INTEREST AND FEES. No thanks; I did my taxes, I filed on time, and I'm not going to find out next year that I owe the IRS this money back, plus more, because of their mistake.

First, I called my bank and asked if the IRS could or would just pull the money back and was told that's impossible. Then I called the IRS (imagine the amount of time on hold) and spoke to someone in the refund department who could not confirm that I'd been paid twice. We also wondered about the missing $6. Why was the double payment in two checks? Why did those add up to $5,600? Why not $5,606? In the end, she suggested that I call my bank and have them reject those two checks, assuming another $6 check would arrive in the future -- at least it wouldn't cost me much of anything in interest when it arrived. So I did.

Is anyone reading this in a family of four, with two dependents, earning an AGI under the limit to qualify for the stimulus, yelling at me for what I did? That's right, I returned my $1,400 per person stimulus check, for joint filers with two children. I still have no idea why they broke it into two random-sized checks and don't know when or how or if the backlogged IRS will send the money back.

I'm so mad at myself for trying to do the ""right thing"" and misplacing $5,600 in the process. Any ideas on who to contact or what time frame for a resolution would be helpful and appreciated. Or just laugh at my stupid move.",Yes,Yes,No,No,Yes

Iâ€™ve driven an 06 impala for the last decade. It wasnâ€™t until this past year where the smaller maintenance items really started adding up.

The last few years Iâ€™ve been doing the mega backdoor Roth and moving the post-tax funds all together when I reach my employers post-tax limit of $10k. Usually this has happened after Iâ€™ve already maxed out my own pre-tax contributions  

I messed around with my bonus contributions and itâ€™s going to end up that Iâ€™ll have maxed my post-tax 401k contribution limit of $10k next month, and my pre-tax contributions will still take another few months to reach $20.5k limit. 

Iâ€™m pretty sure the answer is yes, but can I convert the mega backdoor funds before reaching my pre-tax limit?

1. Is this coverage typically per account or per user - so if I opened two accounts at fidelity would I still be capped at $500k, or would it be up to a million?
2. Is it common practice or recommended to open accounts elsewhere solely for this reason if account portfolios get too big?

Per fidelity: The Securities Investor Protection Corporation (SIPC) is a nonprofit organization that protects stocks, bonds, and other securities in case a brokerage firm goes bankrupt and assets are missing.

tz8tez,nolablue1024,"Moving to MCOL area - budgeted for a house, choosing to rent for now?

I'm moving for work from a LCOL area to a MCOL/HCOL area in a few months. I've got good income ($180k), decent amount of liquid cash for a downpayment ($85k) and additional stocks ($700K) and retirement funds ($400k). I have no debts at 31 and its just myself. 

I currently rent for $1350 a month in my current city, and was planning to buy a house in the new city. I looked at a few places, didn't love anything so never ended up making any offers, and figured I'd at least rent for a bit and get a feel for the new city a bit more. I was a bit bummed because with house prices going up everything in my price range was in the suburbs or a cookie cutter townhome. I considered upping my price range but something I'd like would be around $700K and I couldn't see myself justifying a place like that for just myself 

Looking at rentals in the new area I'm probably up to $2300 for somewhere I'd like to live. I don't love the fact my rent would be almost doubling by moving, but mentally just offset it by saying theres no state income tax where I'm moving so I'll have more take home (not a wash, just a make myself feel better). 

When I look at the rental costs it kind of makes me reconsider some of those non-ideal home options such as the townhomes. The mortgage would be a little bit more than rent but I can still afford it. I don't have a strong NEED to own a home or anything and have enjoyed renting relatively hassle free and being able to move around freely. I think I'm still set on planning to rent because my new role there's a decent chance I get moved in another year or two. (Note that this has been my justifcation for each of the last 6 years in my current city and I never ended up moving or buying anything). 

With housing prices going up would be interested to hear if there's any other considerations for the rent/buy option in my situation as a potential first time buyer. Obviously no one can predict what prices will do in the future, but curious what others may do in this situation and if renting still makes the most sense",,,,,

i2xslg,nukidhere,"Kill Student Loans or 20% Downpayment On A House?

**INCOME**

My income: 75k

Wife's income: 60k \*She is staying home this year to be with the kids, returning Fall 21. We consider her income as ""disposable (saving) income,"" and don't want to rely on it for housing payments/bills.

If we went for 20% on a house, we'd nail the student loan debt away as soon as she returned to work.

**STUDENT LOAN SITUATION**

30k federal student loans. Interest rates: 10k @ 6%, 6k @ 5%, 14k @ 3-3.5%.

**HOUSING IN NEW HAMPSHIRE**

Current ""month to month"" Rent: $1,300 (expected to rise - unsure by how much)

Payment with 20% on 300k (30yr): $1,500-$1,600 month depending on town's taxes

Payment with 10% on 300k (30 yr): $1,800-$1,900 month depending on town taxes and includes PMI

**HOUSING MARKET**

See year over year market data link:

Moved here in summer of 2017 thinking things were overpriced and we'd wait and try and buy in the 250k range. Boy were we wrong. COVID made everything worse and everyone is flocking to NH. Most ""starter"" homes are beyond 300k currently. For example our friends bought in 2015 @ 250k and their house is now worth 350k no improvements.

Offers are currently 30-50k over asking, and waived inspections. We've been outbid on waived inspections the past 3 years (3 bids total as we've been picky/patient).

\--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**FINAL THOUGHTS**

I personally lean towards doing 20% as the monthly payment on a house is less daunting. Either way, when my wife returns to work we'd nail away the debt or build back to 20% as fast as possible. I guess I just worry with the current housing market that unless we have 20% we just don't stand a chance.

For example, lets say I plan to retire in the year 2050 (I'll be 65 years old). However, I feel I want to either catch-up or generate more for my 401k or IRA via TDF because I don't like how their glide path is automated, but that's what TDF are for -- hands-off, set-it-and-forget-it process. So, I decide to change my TDF to TDF 2065 -- which I'll be 80 years old on paper. Is it possible to do that?

Hope that makes sense. Any opinions and thoughts are appreciated. Can elaborate more if needed. Thank you!",,,,,
17330gk,Ok_Assignment4100,"Target Date Funds (TDFs): Good for Inflation/Recession?

I was thinking about this because I know TDFs adjust from aggressive to conservative as you get closer to your retirement age. However, considering the economic climate the US is in right now (Recession or something near it), does it adjust to inflation? If not, is it still a good investment, long-term, into your 401k and even IRAs (Traditional & Roth)? I don't really care to really learn too much about the stock market and make a lot. Just enough that it'll last me quite some time in my retirement days to use as retirement income.

As we know, TDF's are automated and will adjust in accordance to how far along away you are from retirement. Seeing where the USA is with some minor turbulence in the economy, we're seeing that our wealth has been impacted. Which led me to think about my own retirement accounts like my 401k and IRAs. I currently have a TDF in 401k (IRAs remain parked with funding). How would I go about protecting myself from inflation/recession when the asset allocation is set automatically, not leaving me any attempt to adjust it?

Iâ€™m currently a 25 year old single guy. My total gross annual income is about $110-120k. I expect to get promotions every couple of years or so for the next decade or so so my compensation should grow about 5-10% a year on average until my mid thirties when promotions will become less frequent.

I currently have about $250k saved up. $150k of that is in a taxable brokerage account and the rest is in retirement accounts. I currently save about $50k/year including all employer matches and incentives.

I really enjoy where Iâ€™m renting now. I really donâ€™t have anything negative to say about my apartment and the community Iâ€™m renting in has a lot of great ammenities and neighbors.

This small regional bank has some nice things going for it. Theyâ€™ve consistantly grown their business over the years. Theyâ€™ve benefited in a positive way from the PPP business loans, most of which wonâ€™t be paid down early as companies seek flexibility. They have a ~3% dividend, and typical issue a 5% stock dividend each year. They have a price to earnings around 6 right now. Theyâ€™re around the same stock price they were 3 years ago when they were making half as much annually. Finally, my personal favorite, I contacted their investor relations and the CFO emails me back with answers within 24 hours. I love small businesses where people wear multiple hats, and this place must have hired at least *one* guy who likes to work.

Edit: 
1. Thank you for the guy researching the temperory impact of the PPP loan and placing it around 100 Mil in loan growth through the program, referencing that most growth has been non PPP in 2020. This makes sense as there were a lot of restrictions with the PPP (limit on company distributions for instance) making it a less desireable option for business owners if you could get something elsewhere. 

2. Someone brought up an acquisition potentially capping the value of the stock. Funny thing with that is that there are two â€œLandmarkâ€ banks, this one and one on the east coast.

poalt5,ORCoast19,"Thoughts on investing in energy &amp; inflation with OXY/WS?

Iâ€™ve been buying OXY/WS this month, kicking myself for not buying them a year ago when I first learned of them. OXY/WS is the cheapest way to invest in OXY if you believe the share price will go up significantly. They essentially give you the right to buy shares at $22 plus the current warrant price. You have up until Aug 3 2027 to exercise this right. These warrants were issued to OXY shareholders during hard times in 2020, to throw them a bone, but I imagine most bailed as the stock collapsed. 

Four reasons I like this play areâ€¦

1. Rising Free Cash Flow. Occidential petroleum has been benefiting from an increasing WTI crude oil price, hovering around $70/barrel as of today. Last quarter it averaged around $65/barrel, and they had cash flow in that quarter above 2 billion (market cap is currently ~24.4 billion for reference). Cash flow should continue to increase as crude price increases, and they work to pay down their crippling debt.

2. The Crippling Debt is Going Away. No one likes debt, right? Especially crippling debt that might bankrupt you in a sudden, extreme downturn? *cough* Covid 2020 *cough*. Apparently management got the message that their debt load could kill them, and have a plan to reduce debt by over 40%, planning to drop from 34 billion in debt at the end of 2020 to 20 billion in debt at the end of 2022. As debt gets paid down the current interest payments of 300+ million/quarter will reduce to under 200 million/quarter, adding over half a billion extra to their free cash flow!

3. Inflation Hedge. OXY has a lot of hard assets, and if US inflation takes off their stock should rise. An example of these hard assets can be found in their land holdings- they own over 1.35 million acres in the permian basin alone. If inflation is high over the next 6 years, I feel the time value of OXY/WS is being very underappreciated. As of today that time value is under $6 per warrant. 

4. Future Energy Needs. Going back to the permian basin, the land that oxy has might one day be reused for alternative energy. Believe it or not, massive solar projects can hit a wall due to environmental groups. Belowâ€™s a link of this issue recently cropping up in San Diego County. For some reason, I donâ€™t think Texas will give a damn about environmental issues, making that previously mentioned 1.35 million acres in the permian basin prime real estate for massive solar projects. In addition to solar potential, OXY has also been working on CO2 sequestering using their pre-existing oil drilling footprint.

Hey Everyone, 
I wanted to get folks opinions on NWN. NWN is a natural gas and water utility provider based primarily in OR and WA. P/E at todayâ€™s close is around 15, and revenue has been increasing low-single digits in recent years. 

Things I like about them include:

- I lived in OR for several years and was both a residential and business customer of theirs. I know their CS is top notch / mailed statements professional /emergency response *fast* (less than 30 mins on a Friday)
- They should be pretty COVID proof, and they have a regulated monopoly. Folks need heat and theyâ€™ve been supplying since the late 1800â€™s.
- They advertise in their annual reports that they have one of the best maintained systems in the country.

Things I donâ€™t like about them include:
- Being a mature utility, Iâ€™m told these trade like bonds at times, and a shift in interest rates can shift their price up (on interest decrease) or down (on interest increase). 
- The NW seems to be having more weather related issues than say the midwest or northeast. For instance, wildfires in OR have been bad in recent years. I actually evacuated my house in 2020 because of them. Thereâ€™s also been droughts making wildfires more likely. Buying into NWN exposes you somewhat to these regional issues, and if it gets bad enough people move thats less customers. 
- The stock likely will never be the next apple, and Iâ€™m young/looking to grow wealth quickly and safely.

rc2mhe,ORCoast19,"VCSA went public this week

Hey Everyone, 
Vacasa, a vacation rental property management company, went public this week. If anyone is interested in them I wanted to share some of my industry experience on them and VRs in general. I competed with them in OR for 6 years and have met dozens of their owners and employees. 

On valuation, after-hours they were trading at a 4.13 billion market cap for ~30,000 properties. This equates to $137,700 per managed unit. Competing with them and other companies in Oregon, most small companies would sell for between $10,000 and $15,000 per unit. The company I worked for was a bottom dweller, and got some units below $7,500 at times. Theyâ€™re expecting 1.25 billion in revenue for 2021 with part of the year having Turnkeyâ€™s acquisition baked in. This means revenue per house is somewhere north of around $41,666 per house before they split out their fees, which isnâ€™t that bad. 

As this type of business scales the margin gets better and better. Managing 200+ units I had net profit margins before taxes around 10% for every dollar of revenue taken in to be split between owner and PM. At vacasaâ€™s scale I could see them getting this north of 20%. If they were just milking the business for cash/avoiding huge IPO-related management bonuses this would put their net profit EBITA at around ~250 million with the 2021 revenue numbers. Doesnâ€™t sound that bad, right?

The downside is theyâ€™ve made a bad name for themselves, and I think organic growth will be hard to come by. Hearing from old employees, management was pretty oblivious to field conditions and field staff member complaints. In a business like this, field staff is ~80% of your employees so imagine ignoring 4/5 of your employees. I recruited HKâ€™s from them all the time due to payroll issues, overwork, and scheduling favoritism. On the owner front, a guy with a townhome in Newport, OR actually reported they left a leak unchecked that caved in his third floor ceiling. Iâ€™ve signed owners further up the coast that found meth and needles *after* their cleaning team had gone in and completed a post stay clean. Operational issues seem to continue to grow but they keep scaling. 

From a revenue perspective, much of their growth stemmed from underpricing the competition dramatically when they started up. This worked for ~5 years where they were able to produce better owner returns due to price undercutting, but competition responded. Now, most owners will produce the same or less compared to homes managed by local competitors. A homeowner I signed from them, one of the first 200, summed it up by saying thereâ€™s too many homes pulling from the same traffic. They havenâ€™t scaled customers as theyâ€™ve scaled, diluting homeowner results. 

In summary, I think the operational issues will limit organic growth, and their profit potential wonâ€™t be realized because management isnâ€™t hungry. Why would you be, being the biggest vacation rental pm in the US? 

Iâ€™ll be a buyer around $2/share, or higher if they step back from their growth plans and focus on their ground game.

Edit: Realized google was showing a bad valuation and edited for the higher. Each managed vacasa unit is essentially 137k+ to buy, crazy high.",,,,,

Each quarter they get 10â€™s of millions more profit for future quarters due to less debt repayment. They also have over 10 billion in FCF this year if oil stays at its current heights and lots of tangible assets if inflation gets out of control.

- Transitioning to EVs and realizing great synergies from a recent merger. 

Cons are:

Not only that but Clayton Homes, a subsidiary of berkshireâ€™s at the annual meeting, unveiled a net-zero energy home. I walked the net-zero home at the exhibit and it was pretty nice. They had a trash can outfront showing the minimal waste. But at ~242k+ including the solar panels the 3 bed, 2 bath was a big shift from the last home I saw showcased by the company. In 2017 they had one that was ~75k+, a 2 bedroom 2 bath. Its almost like the company believes energy is going to be expensive in the foreseeable future.

I have 2100 shares of OXY and 500 shares of SHEL feeling the same way. The space has chronic underinvestment, and large projects started now will take 5-10 years to get online. The russia-ukraine war just added fuel to the fire, and if the EU does an embargo on russia that can create some long-lasting damage to their oil productivity that may never fully recover. 

Then you have environmentalists calling for no new projects whatsoever, and disrupting the flow of supplies. Thats fine if thats what the general population wants to do but at the same time thereâ€™s scientists warning of potential catastrophic sea level rise within 10 years if major chunks of antartica go.

I felt pretty confident at that time because I have about a decade of industry experience, which included competing with them in three different markets (OR, NC and now AZ). 

$VCSA is a shitshow at times- Iâ€™ve personally sold PM services to owners whoâ€™ve reported meth being left from guests after cleaners have gone through and a whole 3rd floor collapsing due to an unaddressed leak to give a few stories. But hereâ€™s the thing, the vacation rental business is very complex. Even at small managers you have issues. We had a housekeeper go crazy in a 180-unit PM and put holes throughout drywall in a house sheâ€™d locked herself inside. The business will always have â€˜chaosâ€™ to some extent because guests are unpredictable, staff can be unpredictable, and shit happens. 

So that all being said, Iâ€™ve started buying $VCSA at these levels, knowing all the good and bad that comes with it. With its current market cap and units under management the price per contract is under $20,000 at this point which is cheap.

ek077s,OutdoorJimmyRustler,"Help Understanding Arbitrage Concept and Theoretical Scenario

I figured some of the bond traders on here might be able to gauge my rationale behind these assumptions.

Many cities across the United States are issuing Pension Obligation Bonds (""POB's"") to pay down pension debt.  In most cases, cities are members of a State-administered investment pool.  Cities are required to pay into the investment pool based on a formula that is multiplied by the quantity of employees that they have in the system.  The pension recipients have promised benefit amounts (defined benefit).  If the State-administered fund fails to make a return that is high enough to cover the increasing costs of benefits, the State basically charges cities to make up the delta.  This is becoming increasingly common.  Usually, cities do not have the money up front to pay this delta, so it sits on their books as an Unfunded Accrued Liability or ""UAL."" 

In California, the State-administered pension system charges municipalities that have a UAL *interest* on the UAL principal based on the State-administered pensions system's estimated investment return.  If the State thinks they can make a 7% market return, they charge municipalities a 7% interest penalty on their UAL principal.  The State does this because if the municipality had actually paid the UAL up front, the State would have taken that UAL principal and made an additional 7% on it.

In response, cities in California have been issuing POB's that have a fixed interest rate of 3-4%.  They pay the UAL principal down, avoid having a 7% interest rate (in place of the lower 3-4% interest rate), and save money in the long run.  

1. Is this what *arbitrage* is?  Taking out a loan for 3%, thus *""*making"" 4%?  

2. The 7% charge from the State pension system in California fluctuates.  There's talk of the State lowering that return projection, which could mitigate the savings made by cities that issue POB's at 3-4% interest.  As such, opponents of this strategy have attacked the rationale behind POB's.  In theory, the State pension system could make a negative return.  When that happens, cities get charged to make up the difference between the assets of the funds and the liability of payments owed to pensioners.  In theory, a city could take out a 3% POB, pay their UAL, and receive a negative return on a huge principal in the short run if the market crashes.    My response to this has been that since we have to pay the UAL anyways, it makes no difference if we pay it now or later.

&gt; SHANGHAI (Reuters) - As shops shut their doors across Europe and the United States, in China the sharp drop in new coronavirus cases has encouraged consumers to venture back into malls and restaurants - for the most part quite gingerly but occasionally in throngs.

&gt; Helping consumers return has been a loosening of quarantine and other restrictions on business and social activity. Restaurants that have satisfied authorities with plans for curbing the risk of infection are now allowed to serve groups of diners and most stores have reopened, though big brands like IKEA and Apple Inc (AAPL.O) have restrictions on crowds.

I've used the Plan It feature on Amex before.  They're still running the offer of $0 fees on their plans.  The problem that I ran into is that the debt from the product that I purchased from the Plan It plan was paid *first* before any of my other debt from other purchases.  For example, I purchased $400 worth of dumbbells and used Plan It.  I also made other random charges to the card for gas, groceries, etc.  When I would make payments to the card (i pay it in full every week), the payments were going to the Plan It balance first.  So, I ended up having to actually pay the whole Plan It amount before I could start chipping away at my other misc expenses.

Has anyone else ever had this problem?  Did I do something wrong?  I'd like to have a Plan It plan, but also be able to use the card for other purchases.  However, I'd like to pick where my payment money goes towards.

I live in Southern California, and a starter home (3br 2-2.5 ba) is going to be around $600,000-700,000.  I'd like to have a downpayment of 20% (or close to it) to avoid PMI.  SoCal has a high cost-of-living, so saving is hard, despite my fairly good income.  I'm at the point where I'm considering pulling back on my Roth IRA contribution for a year or two so I can save more.  I've bounced back and forth between public and private sectors, but now I am in the public sector for good, so I have a pension plan.  I have $85,793 in Roth and Rollover Roth IRA savings from previous private sector employers.  My current employer (public sector) does not participate in Social Security, but I have 15 years of participation with social security already, so I will still qualify for retirement benefits.

I'm trying to work through what I owe (if I do) in federal  taxes (and specifically long-term capital gains or ltcg) for '22 and trying to determine whether I owe estimated tax.  Background details:

1. Single Filer, in my 40s  and assume no previous liability from prior tax years
2. I had income from a part-time, temporary job for a portion of the year:  $7500
3. My W2 shows I paid $235 in federal taxes for aforementioned income (also paid approp state tax)
4. I took distributions from my IRA to assist with  my  Advanced Degree study (early contribution exempted from penalty bc its used for tuition): $21,094
5. From the IRA distributions above, I withheld $3000 for Federal Taxes; in addition I also withheld for state taxes at my state's local flat tax rate.  (Looks like I overpaid on Fed Tax)
6. I cashed out on long-term stock (&gt; 1yr)  I owned through a taxable investment account at various points throughout the year.  Total Gains from stock sales: $30,000. 
7. Assume no short-term gains (ie $0)

&amp;#x200B;

Here's my understanding of the total tax I owe on Ordinary Income (OI):

1. Combine W2 and IRA Contributions:  $37500
2. I'm taking the  standard deduction for this example which I believe is  $12,950 for '22.
3. Determine Taxable Income:  $37500 - $12,950 = $24,550
4. That would imply that my fed taxes due on OI would be: (10% \* $10,275) + (.12 \* $14,275)  = $2740.5

LTCG Taxes:

Based on  [this](https://www.fiphysician.com/capital-gains-stack-on-top-of-ordinary-income/) explanation, my understanding is I wouldn't owe taxes on my LTCG  because the total gains are less than $41,675   (the page is old and the tax rates are outdated but I'm trying to follow the formula).

Question:

So is it correct to say that the total federal tax obligation for '22  would  be the $2,740.5 based on the information provided above assuming all numbers are accurate and complete?  If this is correct, then would this imply I would have a refund and NO estimated taxes due? Thank you in advance!",,,,,

 A representative from the financial institution acting as custodian to my  IRA  informed me that I did not need to pay quarterly taxes on IRA distributions  and that that money could be paid during tax season (this was communicated without any deep conversation about what I've paid out this year).

Hoping for a sanity check...and I'm **NOT** arguing whether it's a good idea to cash out on investments in general....save that for another topic.

So, basically I can cash out on as much as $41675 (if I chose) tax-free before I even earn my first paycheck.

I was wondering about the following scenario ( I am not in this position but I've read how others are):

You have $200k  in crypto on a platform like Voyager.

You are receiving interest on the coins every month

Some portion of the portfolio is used to execute short-term trades based on crypto volatility.  In doing so, you accrue gains from buying/selling.

Voyager announces that they've suspended trading and have restricted your access to assets.  You are not able to do anything with crypto or money for the remainder of the taxable year as Voyager restructures.  They were (are) able to do this because their terms of service stipulate that you are pledging any assets you transfer to their platform.

Let's assume the investor's gains for that year (from trading + interest) are near 10k

For the remainder of the  year, the investor doesn't have access to either the principal or the gains.

g0owm3,PadThai42,"Bought ""free"" paintings from Painter Craft Club for $30 after discovering it is a fake e-commerce business to steal personal information

The worded text on their website is they are giving away **painting kits to consumers due to COVID-19.** After purchasing the paintings, I then found out there is no contact information on their Facebook page, website, no email, no phone number, and the address to their business leads to a company based out of the Philippines.  

After the charge was done, I called my bank to let them know that this is a fraudulent business and WF's response was ""there is nothing we can do."" A claim maybe opened, but since I basically gave away $30 for nothing, I don't know what I can do moving forward to get my money back.

10v7zqx,paulrudder,"Does anyone recommend reducing/pausing 401k contributions while getting out of consumer debt?

I'm paying off some consumer debt - car loan (almost there), credit cards (hopefully by end of year), student loans (this will take a while and is less of an immediate priority but still on my agenda).

My company offers a 6% 401k match that I take advantage of. I was previously contributing 3% to an employee stock discount program also, but just paused that. Painful to do with the current downtrend in the market as I feel like I'm getting a fire sale but every little bit helps. With taxes, medical, 401k and employee stock, almost 50% of my pay was being removed from every paycheck and that's a tough pill to swallow.

 Besides pausing the employee stock contribution for the time being, I was thinking of temporarily reducing or even altogether pausing the 401k match. This is what Dave Ramsey recommends but i just can't bring myself to do a full pause - feels like I'm throwing away ""free"" money for my future. That being said, if I did it for a few months it would help me more aggressively tackle the credit card and car loan.

11n2zr2,paulrudder,"Can someone help me with a tax question?

So I'm using TurboTax, and in 2022, I received $1 in a crypto token via Robinhood's ""Learn and Earn"" program.

When I imported my data directly from Robinhood into TurboTax, it auto-populated this $1 under the Wages and Income - Form 1099-MISC section.

However, when I get to the last step to review my return before filing, it keeps flagging this form and saying I have it reported as miscellaneous income but it isn't reflected elsewhere on my tax return (or something to that effect). i guess I am super confused why I would *need* to also claim it elsewhere on my tax return if it's already being accounted for under the 1099-MISC section.

Does anyone happen to know what it means / what it's looking for, or whether I need to claim this twice on my return for some reason?

There's a whole separate section in TurboTax to manually enter miscellaneous income, which I did for unreported crypto staking rewards i received from other crypto exchanges that didn't generate tax docs. Maybe it's flagging it because I don't have it reported in that section? But that doesn't make sense to me since it got auto imported via Robinhood.",,,,,
11ns6yl,paulrudder,"Tax question I can't seem to find the answer to: Can I delete $0 sales from my 1099-B?

I tried posting this on r/tax and didn't get any replies, so I thought maybe someone here might know.

I'm using TurboTax and imported all my crypto transactions from 2022 via CoinTracker, which auto generated a 1099-B listing every single transaction.

I guess because I earned weekly ""Staking"" rewards (similar to interest or dividends) through exchanges like Coinbase, I have small transactions for fractions of tokens being received for $0. Just as a hypothetical, let's say I bought 999.95 XLM tokens (a pretty cheap coin) and staked them... each week I might have received 0.005 XLM's as a ""reward,"" but each of those distributions have a $0 value because they're practically worthless.

When I sold/disposed of some of these holdings later on, CoinTracker automatically accounted for every single lot I ever received of each coin, even though many of these micro transactions of received interest/staking were virtually worthless.

So for example let's say I sold 1,000 XLM, and 999.95 of those were what i originally purchased, and the other .05 were the total of all my staking rewards for the year... It's showing on my 1099-B a ""sell"" transaction for *every single staking lot I received,* and every single one of them has a $0 value. 

Because CoinTracker is reporting and tracking every single one of these $0 staking rewards, they are showing up on my form 1099-B, so I have a bunch of $0 sales listed. TurboTax is flagging these as an error and asking me to adjust the cost basis, but I can't, because they are essentially worthless. I guess TurboTax is confused because normally if you're selling something it has a value, but in this case each lot is so small and miniscule that there's literally no dollar value attached.

All this being said, I'm assuming I should just go ahead and delete anything that is $0, correct? I don't need to document sales of small lots with a worth of $0? Even if all those lots combined added up to a few cents, it's not like I'm going to get in trouble for not claiming them, correct? I'm assuming as long as I have anything of actual dollar value accounted for then I should be fine?",,,,,
12jop68,paulrudder,"Removing PPI from my mortgage -- is it worth doing now, or should I just let it fall off automatically?

I purchased my home for $144k in 2019 and I've paid down the principal to $135k. A decent amount of my monthly mortgage payment goes towards PPI which I'd love to have removed. I'm in PA and my understanding is that it automatically falls off after you reach 20% equity in your home? Which in my case I think would mean paying it down by about $30k.

But the estimated value has risen exponentially over the past 4 years and it says it's worth at least $200k now and I know homes have sold for around $220k on my street.

So my questions are:

* if I just make additional payments on the principal will it automatically fall off once I pay it down by that \~20% number?
* is it worth paying for someone to come out and do an evaluation of the property, and if they estimate it's worth more and I already have 20% equity in the home, would I be able to send that info to my mortgage lender and they'd basically just remove the PMI?

I feel like I know the answer to this already but just need people to tell me â€œyes.â€

I made some stock investments in 2020-2021 when my income was a bit higher and my debt was lower. My credit cards have increased substantially the past year and although my income will be higher the remainder of this year, I just hate carrying the higher balance.

I could cash out some of my stocks right now for minor losses, and immediately pay off one of the card balances, but I keep thinking â€œwhat if the market rallies and the stock 5xâ€™s?â€ - which I know is not really the right mentality to have and feels more like gambling.

17my242,paulrudder,"Should I cash out stocks to pay down credit card debt?

It's embarrassing to admit but I have about $25k in credit card debt at the moment.  Fortunately half of that is on a 0%apr transfer card, and the rest is on a relatively low interest card (13.99%).

I was making more money in 2020-2022 and just got hit with a lot of setbacks this year, including medical expenses blah blah... end of the day it doesn't really matter, but I started relying on my card more thinking I'd be able to pay it down with each month's commission check, but then there was always something random and unexpected that would set me back further, like an $1800 vet bill. 

All that being said my income is decent at about $100k/yr... but after taxes, medical deductions, 401k, etc. I have only netted about $55k this year. So at first glance it sounds like I should be able to pay off this debt ASAP with my income level, but the reality is I'd have to pause my 401k contributions to really increase my take home pay and there's not much I can do about high taxes and medical insurance deductions.

I have about $5k in company stock and $1500 is currently eligible to cash out. I'd hate to do it with the market the way it is right now but I realize it could also downturn further next year if we do enter a proper recession. I guess I was looking for some advice on what I should do.

I would hate to pause my 401k but do you guys think in the short term it would make sense for a few months?

i really don't have that much in the way of frivolous expenses, but it's just me with a dog and a cat to care for, a mortgage to pay, a car loan (almost paid off) and now $350/mo in student loan payments starting back up so it starts to feel spread very thin. My biggest out of pocket expense each month is absolutely on groceries. I rarely eat out, never Doordash, etc. -- that's why it sucks to have so much credit card debt... I don't even feel as though I'm buying lavish things. I never go on vacation. I try to budget, but there's just always something that sets me back. I really don't know how people get by these days because I always thought if I was making six figures life would be easy, but I still feel very much paycheck to paycheck.",,,,,
17wpsg4,paulrudder,"Looking for financial advice on which of these medical plans I should choose for next year

Which of these medical plans would you guys pick in my shoes? Iâ€™m looking for objective advice from a financial perspective.

I have to choose between a Pay Later or Pay Now medical PPO plan for next year through my employer.

Pay Later is $49 biweekly and has an $800 deductible and $4000 out of pocket max in network, $7500 out of network max, and copays for doctor visits are $5 more.

Pay Now is $67 biweekly but features a $500 deductible, a $1500 out of pocket max in network, $4000 out of network max and doctor copays are $5 less.

Iâ€™m generally healthy in my 30s but had a scare with a cyst on my kidney last year. The first MRI results were reassuring but my urologist does want me to go back and get a second MRI in spring 2024â€¦ so Iâ€™m going into next year knowing Iâ€™ll have to pay for the MRI. I do not know whether that would be enough of an incentive to pay for the Pay Now plan so I have a lower deductible and out of pocket max depending on the MRI costs.

Besides that I donâ€™t really foresee too many medical expenses. I was thinking of trying to find a naturopathic doctor but they donâ€™t usually take insurance anyway. But maybe that would go to my out of pocket max? Not sure how that works.

esjyie,paulrudder,"Is my homeowners' insurance going to go up because of this?

I made another topic earlier in r/HomeImprovement and got some good feedback. TL;DR version -- someone threw a rock through my double pane window last night and it shattered the outer pane. Didn't notice until this morning, called the police and the guy who came out told me to check with my insurance company and see if there's a deductible for vandalism since I'm basically S.O.L. in terms of them catching whoever did it.

I didn't realize I have an insurance *agent* that I'm supposed to contact first (only been a homeowner for a year), so I called the insurance company directly and explained what happened to the rep. He told me he would have to pass it along to their claims department and have someone give me a call. I reiterated that I wasn't interested in filing a claim at this point but just wanted to know what my deductible would be... and he said he couldn't tell me until they looked it over. I feel like he pulled one over on me because I later found out that by passing it to their claims department it was processed as a claim.

Someone in the original topic about the window damage told me that this could go on my account history, and that I should have called my agent first for advice. So I found my agent's info and called them and they told me to call the insurance company back and cancel the claim. Called them back and it had already been assigned to some guy in the claims department. Got his voicemail. An hour later he emails me back and says he canceled the claim for me. I replied and asked to clarify whether this would go on my account history and he said he couldn't tell me that, and that for rate-related questions I needed to ask my agent.

Called my agent back, and she told me I'll probably be OK since it was canceled so quickly and that she wouldn't worry about it, but that she won't be able to tell for a few months and that the best time to check is when my policy is due for renewal and we can address it then.

SOOOO basically today has been a nightmare from beginning to end and now I'm worried that my premium is going to go up next year even though I very clearly stated from the onset that I didn't want to file a claim. I guess I should have known about how agents work, but quite honestly I've never had to go through anything like this before, not even with my vehicle (knock on wood). I was wondering if anyone here has an opinion on whether this could impact my score/premium and, if so, how much?

ew43er,paulrudder,"I get paid commission (sales) and had 30% taken out for taxes; is this standard?

Sorry if this is a stupid question. I will delete it if I'm an idiot for asking haha. But it's hard to use tax calculators I found online because they are usually based on salary or hourly, and my income is largely commission.

I was really stoked to get a big pay check tomorrow because I made the most commission of any month and achieved my annual budget, so also got an additional bonus on top of that. And because there were three pay checks this month all my medical was already taken out of the last one so I thought less would be withheld. Long story short my gross pay was $6800 and I just got my pay stub for tomorrow's direct deposit... And it's $4600. Still a lot and I'm grateful regardless but I just thought it was a bit less than I had expected. But I'm also fairly naive when it comes to how taxes work and that's why I thought I'd ask here.

When I look at my net vs gross pay for the year so far it says 31% has been withheld for taxes so maybe that is right in line with where it should be?

Thanks!",,,,,
ewqdao,paulrudder,"Is it possible to deduct the expense for LinkedIn Sales Navigator when I file taxes? (I work in sales.)

I work for a major telecom company, and my role is in outside sales. Despite trying numerous times to make a case for LinkedIn Sales Navigator (which is a prospecting tool that is *awesome* for finding leads and bypassing gatekeepers, but also happens to cost $60/mo annually and $80/mo without contract), my company won't allow me to expense the cost -- most likely because if they allowed me to, then every sales rep would want to across the nation. They also have licensing agreements with specific software/websites (like AdMall) so I would imagine it might be against some kind of pact they have with them, but that's just speculation.

Anyway, I really, really love the tool and actually made a sale with it in the past for $6k/year, so I know it works. But I hate the idea of paying that much money out of pocket each month. Yeah, it could very well offset its cost if I bring in even just a couple big purchasers -- but it's still a little tough to swallow a $720 price tag.

So my question is -- I know in the past when I use TurboTax it will ask if I have work expenses and receipts. I usually don't put anything in, since my company will reimburse me for small things (e.g. if I needed to buy a charger for my work phone, or something like that). But would I be able to itemize/deduct a substantial cost item like the membership to LinkedIn Sales Nav? 

I did Google the question but didn't really find very definitive answers. I asked LinkedIn directly and they directed me towards one of the somewhat vague articles about it. So... thought I'd ask here in the hopes of getting your input! Thanks in advance!",,,,,
f6erqf,paulrudder,"Having trouble figuring out W4 allowances - my employer doesn't have a worksheet for it.

I'm in debt, trying to pay it down as aggressively as possible. I listen to Dave Ramsey and he always tells callers not to have any extra tax withheld from their pay checks because it's basically giving the government a free loan all year.

I went into my employer's HR web portal and clicked on my tax withholding, and it just has a box to enter ""number of exemptions."" Initially I believe I had 0 exemptions for both state and federal. Right now I have 2 for federal (changed it in December based on the advice of a coworker) and 0 for my state (which is PA).  However I don't know if 2 is too many, too little, etc. -- I don't want to owe money but I also don't extra withheld. I was afraid to touch the state exemptions because I wasn't sure if it worked differently than federal.

I've Googled how many to claim, and the pages always say to fill out the employer's tax withholding worksheet. The problem is my employer doesn't have one. It's literally just a page that lets me change the numbers without any explanation of what they do or point of reference.

That being said, can you guys advise on what you would do in my shoes?  If it matters at all, I'm 31, single, no dependents. I am salaried at $45k but have a sales job, with an additional \~$25-$30k due in commission, which I believe is paid out as 'bonus' income (and based on what I've read on this forum before, bonus money is taxed at the full 30% regardless of how many exemptions one chooses?

First of all, let me say how great it is that this subreddit exists because I've had a couple tax related questions pop up recently and you guys have been able to point me in the right direction. I'm really grateful for that!

I work full time and received a form 1095-C last week. From my understanding it's proof that I had employee provided health care. Turbo tax has an input section for the form... But none of their input boxes match up with what's on my form. For example, it says line 1 should provide the employer's info, but on my actual form, line 1 is just *my* name and address. I'm also confused why the form shows about $95 in total coverage because my biweekly pay check takes out WAY more than $95.

Should I just keep this form with my 2019 tax files and not even bother filing it in TurboTax? From a cursory Google search that was advice one person had, but then I read elsewhere that it can apply towards deductions. So I'm not really sure what I should be doing.

f9yod1,paulrudder,"Turbo Tax won't let me submit my federal tax return because of a 1098 form -- and I'm at a loss as to what to do!

I closed on my first home purchase the last week of Dec, 2018 (I believe on the 28th). Sometime in early 2019, my original loan provider sold off the loan to a company called Freedom Mortgage, so since then I've been remitting my payments to them.

I received two 1098 (mortgage interest) forms for 2019: one from the original loan provider, and one from Freedom Mortgage.

I paid $599 in interest to the original loan provider, but the form they sent me has blank fields for everything else -- e.g. where it says ""outstanding mortgage principal,"" it is blank. Points paid is blank (even though, from looking at the copy of my closing disclosure from Dec 2018, it shows that I paid 77 points at closing, so I'm assuming I should list the 77 points since I never claimed them for my 2019 tax returns?).

The other form I received from Freedom Mortgage has full details for everything and all the boxes are filled in... but Turbo Tax will NOT let me submit my federal taxes until I fill in the ""outstanding mortgage principal"" for the original loan. It tells me to ""check my January 2019 mortgage statement"" if it's not included on the 1098 form -- but I do not have the mortgage statement from January, and since I no longer deal with the same mortgage company, I don't have online access to pull the statement, either.

fceo91,paulrudder,"Should I re-finance my mortgage for a lower interest rate?

I bought my first home in Jan 2019 and was locked in @ 5.125% with an FHA loan, 30 years fixed. The original loan amount was for $140,400 and my current balance is $138,189, so I've paid it down only a couple thousand dollars. My taxes and insurance are escrowed in.

I was contacted with an offer to refinance @ 3.625% FHA, same loan terms (30 years fixed)... but due to closing costs and all that fun stuff, it would actually raise my balance to $143,420.

Now, I do plan to stay in this house long-term so I know it probably makes sense to refinance... but it's hard for me to stomach seeing the mortgage balance increase to above where it was even initially, and quite honestly I'm not sure if the lower interest rate is appealing enough to make it worthwhile yet. It would lower my monthly mortgage payment by just over $100 which isn't too bad, but still... I hate seeing that principal balance increase by $5k.

fuscf9,paulrudder,"Trying to snowball my credit card debt - do you guys recommend any particular personal loan/consolidation services with low rates or should I stick to 0%APR cards?

For the past year I've been actively paying against my credit card debt. I'm embarrassed to say I had it up to $30k at one point (long story - combo of immaturity, lack of budgeting skills and quite honestly a depressive period where I felt defeated) but I've wisened up, learned a lot, and am on a written budget now. I've brought it down to $18.5k at this point with no frivolous spending, but it's been tough and I have had the Murphys Law setbacks, e.g. I switched to a cheaper car insurance policy but didn't realize it had to be paid in full for the entire year in cash, so suddenly my $80/mo insurance budget was an $850 bill. ðŸ˜‚ Then I had someone throw a rock through my living room window and had to shell out $350 for repairs... But that's life right? 

Anyway, the ""0% APR balance transfer"" cards I had transferred my two highest balances to will be ending in a few months. (they are typically 18 months.) once the promo ends the APR is ridiculously high, ranging from 24â€”30%.

I was considering opening more promotional zero APR balance transfer lines of credit, but I'm wondering if it makes more sense to consolidate the remaining balances onto a personal loan/debt consolidation service. I think mentally this might help me (having payments spread across multiple cards makes it *feel* like I'm making less of a dent each month than if I could just apply bulk sums to a single balance) but there are also fees involved with the initial transfers. 

My credit score is around 760 iirc (I just had it pulled while refinancing my home for a lower rate and I was surprised how much it had gone up) if that helps at all, I wasn't sure if a debt consolidation service would be ideal in this case or if I would qualify for a lower rate loan through something like a federal credit union? 

Thanks for any input you might have!",,,,,
ibo9ea,paulrudder,"Anyone have experience with Discover personal loans? (for debt consolidation)

I have been trying to snowball my debt and have whittled down my credit cards from $30k to $16k in about a year and a half (I know, it's embarrassing, but I was very dumb and naive and maybe a little self destructive after college and got in so deep I stopped caring for a while - it's been a humbling path to pay it all down, haha).

Anyway, my remaining balance is spread across three cards, one of which is a promotional zero balance APR but it's set to expire in November and my other two already expired. I believe the interest rates are 10.99 and 20.99.

I was going to open another zero balance card and transfer them but they typically hit you with fees for doing so. Instead, I was thinking of getting a personal loan to pay off the majority of the remaining balance.

Discover offered me a 60mos loan for $15k @ 10.99 apr and I was considering taking it. I know on paper it's moving one debt to another form of debt but I do think mentally it will help having everything consolidated. Right now I feel spread thin having to apply payments to so many different companies and having the credit card debt all under one umbrella might feel relieving, if nothing else.

That said I was wondering if anyone here has dealt with Discover and/or would recommend any other services. I've never missed a payment and my credit is fairly strong (almost 800 last I checked).

I make about $60k (give or take - I'm in sales and was going to make closer to 70 but covid messed that up!) and my other monthly payments are the normal stuff - mortgage ($900), car ($260) and utilities (varies).

nyku3s,paulrudder,"Are capital gains on stocks offset by losses?

Probably a dumb question.

I understand you have to pay roughly 30 percent tax on stocks sold under a certain time period (I think a year and a half?).

But would those taxes be negated by losses?

Example: on January 1st, I buy 500 worth of one stock and 500 of another. On Dec 31, one stock has doubled (500 dollars profit) and the other stock plummeted to the point that when I cashed out I actually lost $400.

So now I've got the $500 from the first stock on top of my initial $500 investment...but I only have a hundred dollars left from that second stock.

So, my actual profit is only $100.

qa0ayb,paulrudder,"Does anyone here have familiarity with cryptocurrency taxes? I have a question about trading one token for another

I might go to a tax accountant next year for peace of mind, but I'd also like to know now so that I can make sure I'm recording transactions properly. I also worry that accountants in my conservative town may not have a clue about this topic lol. 

It's my understanding that when you ""swap"" one token for another it's a taxable event since it's technically a sale of one asset for another.

My situation is this: I usually just buy and hold with Fiat dollars on Coinbase, but I decided to buy a promising up and coming token that is not yet available on Coinbase and cannot be purchased with US dollars. Basically the only way to buy is to ""swap"" bitcoin or USDT (a stable coin tied to the US dollar) for this new crypto coin. 

So, I withdrew about 60 XLM coins (roughly $23 usd) from my wallet and sent it to another app called Kucoin. I then sold the 60 XLM for ~$23 USDT (again, this being a stable coin but not actually USD) and *then* used that USDT balance to purchase this new coin. 

Now, I guess my question is this: when I sold my 60 XLM coins for USDT, there's probably a cost basis involved... But since this is taking place on a different app from Coinbase, how do I ""consolidate"" or calculate those numbers? In other words if I was buying XLM repeatedly over the past year and then I ""sell"" 60 of them (even though I'm technically just swapping them for another coin to turn around and buy another), how do I calculate my cost basis for tax purposes?

Let's say I bought some XLM at X value last year, some more at Y value this year, and now I just sold *some* of my total balance at Z value... Would x be my cost basis?

Now, I don't exactly make a lot of money but I seem to have pretty expensive hobbies. I'm on the fence of trading one hobby for another or just saving up over the course of a year or two to be able to fund my next.

I got into collecting records and I can roughly sell my collection for $10k-$15k which would be plenty to buy one expensive pinball machine or a couple cheaper ones.

I'm not into collecting or listening to records as much as I used to be so for now it seems like a nice decoration in the living room.",,,,,
vnazzr,PeeB4uGoToBed,"How do I tackle this loan in a faster and cheaper way?

A couple years ago I had to replace my furnace and AC and they financed it through ally lending. It was a $12,000 job with a finance charge of $5,436 APR of 7.99%.

I've been paying $200 a month instead of the minimum $145.53 because I'm not about to pay off this loan over 10 years lol. I'm not sure if the extra $54.47 is going to interest or the principal. 

Is there somewhere better for a personal loan with a smaller interest rate? I'm currently looking at 54 months left at my current $200 a month",,,,,

1052a8m,pigskins65,"How does Secure Act 2.0 affects ppl ages 50-59 re catch-up contributions?

I'm reading this:

&gt; Catch-Up Contributions Increased; Must be Made on a Post-Tax (""Roth"") Basis. In 2023, participants age 50 and older can contribute an extra $7,500 per year annually into their 401(k) account. This amount will increase to $10,000 per year (indexed for inflation) starting in 2025 for participants age 60 to 63. Also, after 2023, all catch-up contributions for participants earning over $145,000 annually must be made on a Roth (after-tax) basis.

Does it mean that starting in 2024 any/all catch-up contributions (for those earning more than $145k) must be made on a Roth basis even for people age 50-59?",,,,,
10h5pnb,pigskins65,"[USA] Where to park funds for a high-deductible health plan? I am almost certainly going to hit the max OOP.

The bad news -- right after open enrollment completed an issue was discovered that required me to have a very expensive procedure. I met my deductible and max OOP for 2022 and will more than likely meet them again this year. I was thinking I should/could take the max OOP amount ($6000) and park it somewhere. The good news is that I didn't need to touch HSA funds last year and am still able to sock away the max HSA contribution for 2023 and not have it impact our financial situation. Using those funds now would feel like a buy-high-sell-low situation.

I have access to a HYSA (dump it in with my EF?), T-Bills through TreasuryDirect, accounts with Fidelity. I know we're not talking a lot of money so maybe I am overthinking it. Any suggestions?",,,,,
1052k0l,PizzaThrives,"Stay the course in Trad or chase a lower-tax future with Roth in my 401k?

I've spent most of my life making Trad contributions to my 401k and getting employer contributions.  I feel like I messed up.

I feel like I should've done Roth contributions in the early days.

Now I'm in my early 40s with \~$143k gross annual salary (before bonuses or RSUs) and I think most would say that I missed the bus and that at this income level I should continue doing Trad contributions.  Agree or disagree?

Personally, I feel like I rather pay higher tax per paycheck now to reduce tax burdens in retirement and go full Roth contributions to my 401k from here on out.  We also don't know what tax laws will be like in the future.  What do you guys think?  Oh yeah, my plan also allows in-plan Roth conversions using after-tax dollars too, if it makes a difference. 

TLDR; should my contributions go to Trad or Roth in 401k?

107jwpl,PizzaThrives,"HYSA or SPAXX? Where do leave cash to sit.

Hi all, I currently have a HYSA with Discover and another one with Ally.  Both have the same yield of 3.3% at the moment and I use them for different reasons/purposes.

I also use Fidelity for my 401k, IRA, and taxable brokerage.

Recently I read that the SPAXX (Fidelity Government Money Market) offers higher yield than the HYSAs out there.  If this is true, why would anyone need a HYSA?  Should I move all my cash to the SPAXX?

I'm not finding enough SPAXX vs HYSA info out there.  If someone can explain it to me, that'd be very much appreciated.

Thank yous!",,,,,

In the PF graphical prime directive, it suggests to pay off any high interest debt, defined as anything with an interest rate above 10%.

This year the contribution limit went from $6k to $6.5k. 

I recently set up a recurring direct deposit to a separate savings account (Discover HYSA) so that on Jan 1, 2024 I can lump sum $6.5K in. 

But will it go up again? Maybe $7k?
