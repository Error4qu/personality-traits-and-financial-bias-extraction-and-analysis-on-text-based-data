vmn5jk,IPatEussy,"Can I afford to live alone?

Hey PF! Back again for more assistance. Hope all is well.

Iâ€™m wondering if I could â€œaffordâ€ to live alone. I know this post will seem like Iâ€™m trolling but Iâ€™m being 100% serious. Itâ€™s more or less to see if paying this much would stunt my financial growth overall. Currently live in FL.

26M, 140k base (tech, WFH), so I make $8,000/m take home after deductions and taxes. I have $60,000 in cash saved up w/ $13k in student loans coming due in August, or whenever forbearance is done. No car payments. No CC debt. Average spend of $3,500/m now w/ currently rent burden of $1,250.

I want to move to Miami but studio apartments after everything are ~$2,500, which is my absolute max. Ideally, Iâ€™d love for it to be $2,200. I am currently not open to having a roommate as Iâ€™m very picky w/ my living area and canâ€™t afford to trust a random. Plus, itâ€™d kinda be nice to not have a roommate anymore.

$2,500/$8,000 is nearly 32% of my take home going to rent. Am I wasting my money?

My logic for moving to Miami (Wynnwood/Downtown/Brickell) is itâ€™s walkable, diverse and Iâ€™ll be extremely close to the beaches. I hate driving (do own a car though). In addition, I think that living in a nice apartment complex around people my age would help me make friends as Iâ€™ll be moving there alone. Worse case scenario is I could pay the expensive rent for one year and then move further away after Iâ€™ve made friends.

Does it make sense to spend this much money on rent? If I canâ€™t be in a centralized area like one of the three I mentioned Iâ€™d rather not move. Let me know your thoughts.

Thanks!",Yes,Yes,Yes,No,No
vua86y,IPatEussy,"Traveling the U.S. for 4 months â€” am I missing anything in my budget?

Hey PF! Back again for more help and insight.

As the title says, Iâ€™ll be traveling the country next month. Iâ€™ll be covering 17 cities for 5-7 days each. I wonâ€™t have my apartment or a home to come back to so that way Iâ€™m not paying double rent. All my stuff will be stored at my friends house. I also wonâ€™t be driving/traveling w/ my car. I will be working remotely during the weekdays on a typical 9-5 schedule.

So far, Iâ€™ve accounted for:

- Food ($75/day)
- Accommodation ($200/day)
- Transportation (Ubers, flights, trains &amp; buses i.e. NYC to D.C.)
- Sporting events 
- Nights out ($200/location)

The idea is I stay in a less desirable location from Monday to Thursday and stay in a more centralized downtown area from Friday to Sunday to save money.

Am I missing anything? Costs seem to be about $8,000/m for 4 months. I just want to make sure Iâ€™m thinking of anything and everything before I go. Thanks!",Yes,Yes,Yes,No,No
x1iqgu,IPatEussy,"Is relocating to Manhattan lifestyle creep? + tax questions

Hi PF!

Hoping to make this short &amp; sweet.

26M tech worker. 140k base, 11k bonus. 3 years experience.

I have been WFH fully since COVID. 75k cash in savings, 43k student loan debt. Like 8k in my 401(k) but I donâ€™t even count that.  Considering relocating from FL to NYC in October/November.

Reasoning is I think FL is too slow/spread out for me (been here 4 years) and most of my friends/family are in CT/NJ/NY &amp; MA. NYCâ€™s public transport is unmatched so I wouldnâ€™t need a car and honestly hate driving anywhere over a half hour. In addition, for the prices in where Iâ€™d like to live (Tampa, Miami) I could afford to rent in NYC, even though Iâ€™ll get a 250 sqft apartment instead of a luxury apartment.

Anyways, my take home after taxes in NYC would be $7,350, right now my take home is $8,300 in FL. The job will give me a COLA to at *least* offset the taxes while relocating to NYC (this is guaranteed, theyâ€™re just waiting for me to submit the ticket to HR). So I would be making the same $8,300 at bare minimum.

My three questions are:

1. Is moving to NYC and paying ~$2,300 in rent â€œlifestyle creep?â€ Iâ€™m 26 now. Iâ€™ve lived with roommates before, I just donâ€™t want them. I wouldnâ€™t pay a brokerâ€™s fee so Iâ€™d live in just about anything. I also choose Manhattan over other boroughs because itâ€™s centralized and itâ€™s where my office is. Going rates on studios not in Harlem are about $1,900-$2,300 (StreetEasy). Also, the affordable areas of Brooklyn/Astoria arenâ€™t that much cheaper anymore to be living that far outside the city.

2. I got paid a ~$11,000 bonus earlier in June when I signed on my new company. This is when I was a Florida resident. I still am as of typing, but if I move to NYC, Iâ€™ll switch my license and domicile over. **Will this give NYC the right to tax that bonus even though I was a Florida resident at the time?**

3. Has anyone who lived in Manhattan ever ended up owning something in or around the city? Home ownership is very important to be (stability and wealth accumulation) and it just seems impossible to own anything in NY.

TL;DR â€” Is spending $2,300 on rent while making $8,300 lifestyle creep? In addition, if I got a bonus in a no-state tax state then moved to one with state taxes, would I get taxed on that?

Thanks so much everybody!",Yes,Yes,No,Yes,No
xr5mmy,IPatEussy,"IRA over 401(k) because taxes will go up?

Was speaking with my boss who I respect a lot. 

He stated â€œI donâ€™t max my 401(k) more than the match.â€

â€œWhy?â€

He goes: â€œWellâ€¦ however many years in the future, do you think taxes go up or stay the same?â€

And that got me thinking. If taxes do go up, which they have a history of doing so, isnâ€™t it better just to pay into an IRA now and avoid *maxing* a 401(k)?

Thanks!",Yes,Yes,No,No,No
10vbfcw,ir0nuckles,"Am I right to think the safest thing to do with RSUs is immediately sell them?

I got burned badly last year because I had a large RSU vesting cliff in March, and then company stock tanked 80% in a matter of weeks in May. Yet I still owe taxes for the original vested amount, which really hurts a lot. I am unable to sell RSUs except for the week after an earnings call, due to insider trading laws, so I can't set a limit order or something to protect myself from the stock crashing. I also don't especially *want* to gamble on the short or long term value of the company stock, since this doesn't align with my investing strategy.

So doesn't it make the most sense to immediately sell any RSUs or other company stock (like an employee stock purchase plan) as soon as possible to avoid incurring any losses? The company is paying me partially in stock, but unless I gamble on the value of that stock increasing I may have my income (which is taxed like regular income) disappear. Am I missing something here? Why do people wants RSUs or act like being paid in company equity is beneficial?",No,Yes,No,No,Yes
1195vic,ir0nuckles,"Take a smaller (sub-inflation) salary increase, or company stock?

I've been told I can choose between a salary increase or company stock. I can only get one. The salary increase is going to be less than inflation, I'm guessing around 3-5%. The stock would be more than this but vested over a 4 year period, but it is subject to the stock value fluctuating. The company stock dropped like a rock last year so I am a little nervous about accepting more stock, but it would be a risk with potential for more reward. I do get some stock today but I just sell it immediately after vest because I really don't want to get burned by the stock crashing again. The price goes up or down 10-25% seemingly at random, so this is a real risk.

At my current income and COL I am saving quite a bit, but I am worried about my COL increasing much faster than inflation and much faster than my income. My housing costs alone increased 50% over the last 2-3 years, and seems inevitably it will increase again along with other less substantial costs. I calculated that my average personal inflation rate was around 10% since 2020.

What is the best way to think about this choice? Is it better to 'play it safe' or accept more risk for more reward?",Yes,Yes,No,No,Yes
11b0t7c,ir0nuckles,"Am I doing the best I can to be able to have a better future?

I live in a HCOL city where rent has been sky-rocketing. The plus side is that I have a decent income, and I've always been frugal, so I'm able to save about 60% of my income, and have been doing that for over a decade. I am way ahead on retirement savings and other investments. I also have a good chunk saved in cash-like vehicles for a home purchase or other large expense in the future. I should have about $120k in this short-term fund in another few months, and will probably continue to add to the fund after that.

Despite this, I feel pretty hopeless and depressed. I can save money, but I don't know to what end. I hate living in a big city and would be much happier in a less hectic and expensive place.  I also don't relate to many of my coworkers and peers around me. I used to be more like them, happy to enjoy the big city while I was young, but as I am getting older I feel the desire to escape to a more pastoral setting where i can live more simply and avoid big city problems. 

That is why I started saving up money for a home purchase. I'm getting very sick of renting as my landlord has continuously been doing loud construction and invasively entering my space over and over again. Lots of damage has occurred in the building and it's been disruptive. This is making me more aware of the benefits of owning a home. I tried to buy a  house during the pandemic, but prices were crazy and required that buyers take on all kinds of risks, like waiving inspection and appraisal contingencies. I decided that I would not take that kind of risk, so I'm stuck renting indefinitely, unless I move to another area or I marry someone with double my income. I'm prety depressed about the prospects of this happening, and it seems like I am just doomed to rent a small apartment that is perpetually under construction. I'm being a bit dramatic here, I can move when my lease is up, but I have had many similar issues living in any apartment block style housing with loud neighbors, security issues, etc. and I would like to have my own property, but this is looking very unaffordable for me, despite having a good income.

Am I doing the best I can here to prepare for a better future? I don't need luxuries,  just a simple life. To that end I am saving my income into:

- Emergency fund, around $17k now, enough to cover a couple months in event of a layoff. Already funded.

- Short-term fund, for home purchase or maybe something else if home ownership is really just becoming a thing of the past. This is about 75% funded now. I plan to get it to $120k and add to it more slowly after that. The actual funds are split between I-series bonds, CDs, and a high yield savings account. Looking at treasury bills as a possible option  here as well. 

- Retirement accounts. Around $250k now which assuming i don't touch for 30 years should be enough to cover a basic retirement at 67. Split between various vanguard index funds.

- Non-retirement investment accounts, currently around $500k. Split between various vanguard index funds, with a little bit in company stock. I consider this part of retirement.

My hope is that I can move within another few years to a non-HCOL area. I am pretty paranoid about finances and the economy, so layoffs and the possibility of losing income is fresh in my mind. i am known to be a chronic over-preparer.  Am I doing this right or am I a fool for waiting to buy a home? I am just afraid of buying something without an inspection and taking on all of the risk that comes with that. I also don't like being in a major metro area, or at least not near the urban center.",Yes,Yes,No,Yes,Yes
11rbwwj,ir0nuckles,"Is it wise to invest in retirement accounts before you pay off all debt?

I've been giving a friend advice on getting their finances in shape. (They want help, it's not an imposition, and personal finance is one of my hobbies.)

They have a bit of debt, something on the order of $25-30k, between student and car loan. The car loan is from 2021 at a little higher rate with about $5-10k on the balance, but their student loans are lower and about $20k balance. My initial thought is to prioritize the highest rate loans first.

Their income is around $50k but varies depending on hours worked. Rent is around $1500. We live in a state with no state income tax. They are hoping to increase the income soon with a career change but are unsure how long that will take â€“ however, they have worryingly suggested they might take a lower paying job to work in their chosen field which would put them more around $40k. We live in a HCOL area so this is IMO not a great idea, unless there is some big benefit like loan reimbursement (there is not, to my knowledge) but this is what they went to school for. They are recent out of school and currently working a job they don't like but which does pay the bills.

The official /r/pf guide states to pay off all debt before putting any money in retirement beyond an employer match. However, this person doesn't have an employer match, and they are worried about not having enough saved for retirement. I suggested that they should strike a balance between both â€“ invest some for retirement now, as the additional years of compounding will pay off in a big way, but also pay off the debt at a more aggressive pace because eliminating the debt will save money from interest payments in the long run. They opened a Roth IRA and funded it and feel good about this move, however I'm now worried that I may have steered them wrong and they might be neglecting to pay off the debt. Then again I would not want them to skip investing entirely for the next 5-10 years just to pay off the debt, which is why I think a balance makes sense here.

What would you advise someone in their situation? Am i off base by suggesting a balance of early retirement investing AND aggressive debt repayment is important? 

As a side question, what do you think of their plan to take a lower paying job? It doesn't sound like the career path that move would open would increase their income above what they make now. As a financial decision I would say it's a bad one, but maybe they will enjoy the new field enough for it to be worth the loss of income.",Yes,Yes,No,Yes,Yes
11svej8,ir0nuckles,"Could we afford to rent a house while saving?

We live in a HCOL area where cost of housing is increasing and living in separate apartments is much more expensive than shared housing. I see houses or town houses for rent around $3000 or so per month. I am trying to get some second opinions on this plan. The house would be split between me and my partner. Partner is saving for retirement. I am saving for retirement and to eventually buy a home. I would like some advice on if I am saving for the house correctly or if there are any improvements to be made.

Me:

- $162,000 salary, net about $8800 / mo. 

- Current rent $2250 / mo

- Currently spend about $3900 / mo. sometimes more like $4500.  (this includes rent)

- Emergency fund $17k

- Anything I don't spend goes into house savings account(s) split between I-bonds ($20k), CDs ($30k), and high-yield savings ($50k). CDs are set to mature before 2025; I-bonds will be withdrawn on or after January 2025.

Partner:

- Around $50,000 / yr income, paid hourly

- $400 / mo student loans

- $300-$400 / mo car loan 

- Current rent $1350 / mo, unsure of total expenses but would guess around $3000

- Does have emergency fund but unsure of the balance

- With any extra income, contributes to Roth IRA (VTSAX)

I would pay a large portion of the rent so we could both reduce housing expenses. Does this plan make sense? What would be the minimal income you would recommend for this situation? Does it seem like we could deal with a job loss in this situation? Finally, is the house fund setup properly or is there anything better we can do?

1420fhb,ir0nuckles,"What is a realistic amount to budget for repairs for a house?

I'm trying to understand how owning a house (or condo, etc.) would affect my budget. As part of this I want to be realistic and include all costs including maintenance and repairs. I know that these can be significant for home owners, and the advice is always to have some savings to handle these costs. However, I've not seen much information to help me understanding how to estimate this. I know that it can vary and unexpected costs pop up all the time, but is there a recommended amount to budget for? For example, 3% of the total value of the property annually? Or another measure? This should include everything from yard care, cutting down a tree that breaks in a storm, replacing the roof, plumbing issues, etc.

14kg0qs,ir0nuckles,"In a very different place from partner

Please don't delete this because it's about a relationship. This is very much about finances and how to discuss them in the real world, with friends, family, etc.

I'm curious how others have dealt with having differences in financial situations in a relationship. I'm a bit older than my partner and have a large amount of savings and investments. I've been saving 50% or more every year for my working life. I started out with nothing, so it's all ""self made"" and I am proud of what I've achieved. 

My partner however is in a different place they are just starting to earn money and are now considering a career change that would bring student loan debt and they would make less money. It's possible this might translate into more money in the future, but not for a while. We haven't discussed if I would be expected to support them financially during this transition, it has been something they've been thinking about for years.

We don't really talk about money much. It gives me a huge amount of anxiety to think about me ending up paying for their student loans and associated debt like living costs when they take a lower-paying job. I think there is a serious risk I'll become very resentful if I feel i'm being asked to defer or cancel my own plans, to pay for their expenses.

My financial goals in the near future are to a) buy a home, and b) have more flexibility in my work. I don't care to have luxuries but security is important to me. I have been full-time employed in a stressful career field for my adult life and just now feel I am close to having enough savings that I could afford to take a pay cut in exchange for less stress while still having financial security. I can see my plans coming together soon but not if I get thrown a curve ball like an unexpected pile of debt because my partner took out student loans that they can never repay.

My question is how to approach this subject with my partner, or a family member, or anyone who might be financially connected to me in the future. Thank you.",Yes,Yes,No,No,Yes

I've heard on the grapevine that owning a home with a romantic partner and having them not be on the deed/mortgage is considered a liability and a bad idea. Why? Wouldn't the partner basically be a tenant for legal purposes? Why is this considered so risky?

Another related question, if you bought a home before being married, does the property automatically become property of your spouse when you sign the marriage contract? Or would you have to add them to the deed/mortgage? 

More generally I'm confused about how the law treats the assets of partners/spouses before and after marriage.

15rxp2s,ir0nuckles,"Help! How can I 'simulate' home ownership using auto transfers?

I am currenting renting and considering a home purchase. I'm nervous about the additional costs but I have an idea for feeling out what the financial impact will be for me if I own a home. I hope this idea is not too crazy. I'm trying to figure out some details of how to make it work. 

So I created a separate account at my bank that I am calling my ""escrow"" account. I want to auto-transfer the amount of the hypothetical mortgage payment to this account, then have my landlord deduct the amount for my rent from it for as long as I'm renting. Since the mortgage would be about $1500-$1600 higher than rent currently, I would then have some extra money each month which I want to auto-transfer to my house fund.

I know this may seem silly, and I know I could just do this with spreadsheets, but I want to really *feel* the impact while continuing to save for my home ownership goal. I am also really trying to *automate* this experiment as much as possible so I don't have to do manual adjustments every month. 

The theory is, if I can get used to having my $XXXX transfered to ""escrow"" every month then I can buy with confidence knowing what my finances will look like every month -- not just on a spreadsheet, but having experienced it for months. This would help me feel less anxious about taking on the extra costs.

I'm trying to get an assessment of whether I'm financially ready to buy a home in the next 6-12 months, and whether or not my plan makes any kind of sense. Looking for suggestions and things I am missing.

**Debts / Credit accounts**:

- No debts â€“ paid off car, no student loans

- Two credit cards, auto-pay full statement balance every month

- Last credit I applied for was about a year ago, adding a credit card. Will this hurt me?

**Credit score**:

- Last hard pull I did for a mortgage application > 1 year ago it was over 800. Credit Karma says 758 and 770, but I would expect this to be higher in a real pull

**Personal Info**:

- Age 38

- Unmarried, no kids

- Current rent is about $2500 (18% DTI)

- Rental lease expires in about a year, but I can pay a $5,000 fee to terminate it early with 30 days notice. Month to month is possible but very expensive, like 2x the rent. (I mention this to give some idea of how to strategize around the lease end date.)

**Assets**:

- $270k in retirement accounts (401k, IRAs)

- $515k in taxable investment account (mainly broad US index funds)

- $22k in cash between checking and emergency fund

- $114k cash in my house fund (split between savings bonds, CDs, and MM funds â€“ should be matured and liquid by the end of the year)

- $23k company stock, which I'm in the process of selling to add to the house fund â€“ I am considering this as part of the ""house fund""

**Income**:

- Base salary $162,500 with about $8400 net monthly

- Contribute 11-12% of base to retirement

- Stock paid out quarterly, usually around $9000-$10,000, or about $38,000-$40,000 annually. 

**Financial Plan**:

- Planning to sell company stock, putting the current ""house fund"" up to $137k today.

- I plan to have $150k or more in my house fund at the end of the year when CDs and I-bonds mature. I also have some additional stock grant and savings I can add to the fund between now and then. All of this I am planning to keep in a Vanguard federal money market fund (VMFXX) which is currently earning 5.2%.

- I'd really like to put at least $150k into the down payment, as this really lowers the monthly, but worried I wouldn't have enough cash for closing and repairs / appliances / etc.

- Considering selling $20k from the taxable investment account to add to house fund to cover closing costs â€“ do you think this will be necessary? Would take a tax hit here.

**Housing Plan**:

- Looking at a $500k ""starter home"" (sigh...) with > 20% down payment

- Note taxes here are very high, 2.5-3%. I am assuming 2.7% in my calculations.

- I want to keep my DTI under 30%, so will want to keep the housing payment under $4000 / month

- My math indicates that with $140k down, at 2.7% taxes, mortgage at 8% (30 year), insurance at $2500 / yr, I could just *barely* afford a $500k home while keeping my payment under $4000. Does this check out?",Yes,Yes,No,Yes,Yes

I'm planning to rent a house in a few months. The house will be around $3500 a month and I have about $160k income, so I think this should be fine financially. I want to also have my girlfriend move in with me a few months after I move in, so she would help with bills, but this wouldn't happen until her lease is up in a year. 

I also have enough savings to cover the difference in rent compared to my current place, plus quite a lot of buffer â€“ over a year of living expenses at the new hypothetical rental rate, lets say $100k in cash. I'm wondering if it will help me in my applications to reveal these savings to a potential landlord. Or is there a downside here? 

Finally, is there any reason a landlord would not allow my girlfriend to move in with me? She has less income but also brings two additional pets, a small dog and cat. I have one cat.

Reposting, as this was taken down by a bot. Trying to avoid the bot's triggers so I might be phrasing things oddly.

I have enough savings to cover 3-4 years at my current living cost. This amount is also taking into account ""fun"" spending which I would probably reduce substantially if I was out of work.

10pz3wk,Itsallkosher1,"House inheritance with siblings

EDIT: THANKS FOR THE ALL THE REPLIES. THINK WE HAVE A GOOD PLACE TO START NOW. 

Parents have a paid off for house. They have 4 children and plan to divvy up all assets evenly when they die to the kids. However, sibling 1 will take the house to life in with their family. All are in agreement. Whatâ€™s the best way to do this? Letâ€™s say house is worth $800k in a sale so every child would get $200k. Except sibling 1 will live in the house and isnâ€™t able to pay cash for the house and cash out other siblings. Sibling 1 just buying the house and getting a mortgage seems it would work fine and then all the kids getting and even slice of the $800k (including sibling buying the house). But that seems like probably not the best wayâ€”especially for the sibling buying the home since they obviously canâ€™t use any of their share on the down payment for their mortgage. This isnâ€™t super pressing, but itâ€™s nice to start thinking about it early.

Iâ€™m hoping someone can help answer this question who has already done their taxes for the year.

17v642y,Itsallkosher1,"Leasing vs. Buying a Car

I've always bought cars and never leased. My current car (paid off for about 4 years) is starting to have issues so I think it's time to move on. I'm looking at some lightly used EV cars that I can probably get in the $30k neighborhood. I have 3x that amount of cash in a high-interest savings account. No other car payment and mortgage is the only debt I have. I could take this cash and buy a car outright (and I'm getting 4.25% interest right now vs. what I imagine is 8% interest for a used car loan, so it seems that's my best bet?).   


But should I look into leasing instead? I don't like the IDEA of paying $400/month for a vehicle that I won't end up owning, but if I only have to pay down like $3k (no clue of the actual number...), that means I have $27k extra making some money in the bank. It would be over 6 years of leasing at that rate to spend the same as buying the car outright. And after 6 years of owning the car...how much would it actually be worth especially since I anticipate that EVs will become more ""outdated"" faster with batter technology improving (if in 6 years a standard EV can go 700 miles on a charge, my EV that can go 230 miles per charge wouldn't worth very much to most people).

This is all theoretical as Iâ€™m a very conservative investor (just long-term index funds).

For exampleâ€”Apple and Amazon are two companies that are guaranteed to be around for a long long time. Why not make a concrete â€œcash outâ€ deal with myself, say 10%, and when it hits that 10%, just cash out? Everything is low right now (and likely to continue lower), but if AMZ is at $80, nobody will argue that itâ€™s not going to hit $90 at some point. So itâ€™s a gutsy move in the amount (at least personally), but if that number happens in the next week, thatâ€™s an easy $6k profit (I guess thatâ€™s then taxed at capital gains like 30%?). 

Do people do this? Worst case scenario in a stock like Amazon is that I just end up waiting longer than expected to go up. Right?

vwryu2,jarrett312,"I want to get out of my car loan and reduce/eliminate debt

Currently have a $25,000 loan 474$ a month for 60 months at 1.9% on a 2021 Jetta r-line. My insurance is $128 Iâ€™m 20 years old still live at home in my second year of college I go online. My commute to work is 7.5 miles each way. Iâ€™d either like to find a &lt;15K car and finance it or pay outright for a moped. The offer I got from carvana would pay off the debt on my car. I have a 4 month emergency fund that Iâ€™m growing to 6 months plus money in Roth IRA HSA and ESPP and make 60k pretax a year. I live in the Midwest so the climate would be rough and unpredictable for a moped. Should I find a 15K car, trade mine in for it at a dealership (I think will save on IL state taxes) ask to match or exceed carvanaâ€™s offer or Sell it and buy moped or electric bike or suck it up and pay the payments. I know Iâ€™m probably not gonna find this interest rate again especially on a used car. I can handle the cold and wetness of weather but obviously icy roads &amp; low visibility would be larger risk on a bike than a car.",Yes,Yes,No,No,Yes

So a backstory I used to work here quit and came back I first started here two years ago but quit 6 months in. Now I returned and when I received my first check I got my rate of pay as if I never left at 1.5 years just looked at my paystub and have been maxed out at 2 year pay rate $4 more an hour than I should be at. I save a majority of income 80% itâ€™d suck to pay back but I could if I had to.

 Iâ€™m 20 year old I have a larger cavity in front tooth got a dental opinion a year ago was told I needed a crown and xrays showed cavities that could be fixed with fillings. All in all it would of cost $1400 I had surplus emergency funds and wish I wouldâ€™ve put it all behind me. Next week my emergency fund of 6 months ($6,000) will be finished and Iâ€™ll have excess income of $900 that I still need to save for college I currently have $1450 in my HSA $450 is invested I have to keep $1,000 in cash. Current strategy for HSA is keep it until 65 for an IRA. The dentist Iâ€™m considering offers financing interest free, should I get the work done make minimum payments continue to save for school (2 months) then direct that excess biweekly $900 to it? Or just pay the dental work in full? My smile doesnâ€™t cause insecurities nor do I experience pain but obviously shouldnâ€™t ignore the issues to progress into something worse.",No,Yes,No,No,No

Currently owe 24K on my 21 Jetta I have a 1.9% rate for 60 months payment is $474 a month. I make about $5250 a month take home. Carvana has offered me 25,500 I found a 2009 Honda Fit manual clean autocheck and carfaxs with 13,000 miles and is only $10K the general consensus is that they are very reliable. I have about 20K in savings and investments 7.5K savings 9.3K Roth IRA $2000 HSA(could reimburse medical cost Iâ€™ve had) and $1200 ESPP. Should I just try and pay cash I hate the idea of not having an emergency fund but if I did this plan a 6 month emergency fund would only be $3,000 instead of the $6,000 it needs to be now. Iâ€™ve just spent the last 4 months Building my emergency fund and hate the thought of it evaporating. I save $900 every check should I get a loan and instead of saving that $900 just put it towards the loan my FICO Score is 733 what rate do you think would be acceptable for 36 months?

x7ws3y,jarrett312,"What option should I choose to pursue a degree

* Full time job pays $22.15 an hour 50-60 hour weeks
* Part time job pays $13 an hour 16 hours currently 2 days a week potential for 32 hours 2 days a week
* Savings $7500, Roth IRA $8,858, HSA $2232
* No FASFA qualification 
* 20 Years old 
* Expenses $356 Medicine, $128 insurance, $474 car payment, $60 phone bill 
* AOTC forgot to figure in my calculations 
* pursuing accounting degree 

Current Situation I have 18K between savings roth and HSA, I am 24K in car debt for a 2021 Jetta R-line 54 of 60 months 1.9% $474 a month $128 insurance with an offer to sell for 24.5K. This car is preventing me from switching to one of my two jobs to focus completely on school. With my situation currently if unchanged and if I decide to do my one part time job id be riding a fine line of breaking even and negative with my income in terms of saving for school and paying expenses, if negative it would come from savings account which will have $7,500 in it when I leave my full time job and pay for school. The deficit I estimate would be small enough my savings could sustain for 6-7 years but with the time I have to focus on school I could complete my degree in 1.5-2 years as 1 year is already complete.  

Scenario 2 ensues selling my car and getting a cheaper one the best one I could find is 2014 corolla $16,620, my projected financing terms are gonna be 72 months @ 8% about 290 a month this would leave me positive $146 a month after paying for school. But with the amount I would pay in interest it would be absurd and I worry about being underwater in this loan and it potentially crapping out halfway through the loan. This car has passed inspections from mechanics I've taken it to and has a good autocheck score. 

Scenario 3 is getting the car but maintaining dual employment and paying it off like im gonna die if I don't, while still going to school, this would be very hard as I have to dedicate 50-60 hours to work that I can't focus on school,However at my other job 16 hours I could plus whatever I could manage on my days off I. After 6-7 checks of intensity at this loan I could work my one part time job. But since I could not take the extra hours at my second job the opportunity to would disappear as the hours need to be filled so id only be able to save $100 a month after expenses even after the car is paid off.  

Scenario 4 is selling my car and moving in with a supportive family member who is within walking or biking distance to the part time job I want to take, after expenses and saving for school I could save $550 a month which I would put only into savings to waitout the car market  

Scenario 5 is next year I project to make 70K with both jobs do nothing about the current car loan but make minimums Max out a 401K Roth IRA and HSA and contribute Excess to ESPP all of which could be accomplished with  my current expenses and do as many classes as I can bear to do with my working hours 

&amp;#x200B;

TLDR 

* Scenario 1 keep the car but have a small leak in savings until I complete my degree
* Scenario 2 Finace a cheaper car for 6years at 8% to be income positive 
* Scenario 3 finance a cheaper car but pay it off like crazy then go part time and lose the hours
* Scenario 4 sell my car adjust living situation to not need a car and buy when the market slows
* Scenario 5 Dont change my situation and max retirement accounts working strenuous hours while trying to go to school",No,Yes,No,No,Yes

Last year I joined a new company which gave me a 25k signing bonus that has a 12 month vesting period. It has been 6 months and I feel like leaving to a new role. The 25k signing bonus is accounted to my tax obligations for 2022 at which I had a 32% income tax bracket. This year I am expecting a 24% tax bracket on my income. If I have to pay back the 25k bonus then will I be returned my extra taxes I paid last year on the income? 

For example in 2022 I paid $8k in taxes on the 25k bonus at a 32% tax bracket.

In 2023 if I return the 25k and get it deducted from my income for this year then I will save 25k on my taxes at a 24% tax bracket which is a 6k deduction in my tax liability.

Doing the math, if I elect to put 5% down then for a 30 yr loan I am paying an effective 4.78% interest on my first 61.8k and 3.0% interest on the remaining 329.6k loan. For 84 months I will be paying PMI until I reach 20% equity in which I will get the PMI withdrawn.

For a 15 yr loan, I am paying an effective 3.34% interest on the first 61.8k then 2.25% interest on the remaining 329.6k loan. It will take me 32 months to hit 20% equity and remove my PMI.",No,Yes,No,No,No

r3w7qb,JayceThompson101,"Company is asking Wife to pay back entire yearly salary?

Hi everyone, my Wife used to work for a company that she recently resigned from. This company is known for being toxic and having a bad culture. This is a professional level job in IT Sales. She was working for 9 months then decided to quit to pursue a different position and the company she left Finance/Payroll department reached out and said she owes them 56k and to wire it to their company bank account. I checked the emails and the bank account is legit. I went to her payroll manager and added up all the gross pay from her 8 months of paychecks and that totals 56k gross pay. Is this even legal? What should we do here? We replied back and said that this request is a mistake. We have not agreed to any form of payment, so no slip ups there. Also they are asking us to send gross pay rather than net pay which is actually 45k, so this just doesnâ€™t make sense. Any help here is appreciated!

Edit: There is no repayment clause in the contract. No commission advancement. Just a clearly stated base pay with opportunity to earn on target earnings. Cookie cutter offer letter employment contract that you would see in any other fortune 500 firm. Read every word.",Yes,Yes,No,Yes,Yes
rflmf7,JayceThompson101,"Ordered TV 6 months ago, opened it today, big crack, what so I do?

I bought a samsung tv 6 months ago during a sale from their official website. I received the package and had not opened it until today. Well there is a huge crack the size of a dime on the TV screen. I have a 1 year manufacturer warranty but it does not cover physical damage after registering my device and putting in a service request. The TV cost me $1700 and I am getting a quote from a verified repair shop of $1400 to fix, with the screen costing $1250 as a replacement part. I am outside the return policy window as well since it has been 6 months. What do I do here? It feels terrible spending $1700 on a TV and $1400 on top just to fix it...",No,Yes,No,No,Yes

t1psoz,JayceThompson101,"What car can I afford with high income, but low net-worth? (Mid 20s)

Together we earn 310k gross and 190k post taxes and maxing investment accounts. Our spend rate at tops is 6k a month which includes our housing and total monthly costs (food/bills/gym/etc.). We currently save around 10k a month after all expenses. We currently have 60k cash saved up and are in our mid 20s. We both paid off a combined 100k in debt and bought a home last year hence the low cash amount. No debt at the moment besides 370k on mortgage at 3% rate.

Weâ€™ve always wanted a nice car and truthfully believe that sure it isnâ€™t the best investment, but because we are high earners and live below our means - it is okay to spend a little luxury money to achieve something weâ€™ve always wanted.

My question to the subreddit is what is the upper budget of a luxury car we can afford? I really want a Model S Plaid (lol). Thank you!",Yes,Yes,No,Yes,No

My wife and I are in our mid 20s and just started maxing our 401k. If we both max our 401ks for the next 35 years then we should theoretically have enough to retire, right? This way we donâ€™t have to save excessively unless we want to retire early. What are your thoughts?",No,Yes,No,No,No
