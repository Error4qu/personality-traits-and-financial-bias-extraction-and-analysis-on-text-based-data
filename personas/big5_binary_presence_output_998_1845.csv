fchtku,chargum,"In a Bear Market, it is much better to break your investments in separate total stock and total bond funds than use balanced mutual funds in retirement

I want to show you the math behind the advantages of having separate total stock and total bond funds vs using balanced mutual funds.

Jim retired on October 1st, 2007 and had 2 Million Dollars in his 401K retirement account and is using the 4% rule and is planning on withdrawing a starting figure of $6666 a month which will be adjusted for inflation. He has two accounts 60% of his money is in a total stock market fund and 40% in a total bond market fund. Just when he retires the stock market starts to crash so he pulls his $6666 a month withdrawal out of his bond fund so he does not sell his stocks when they are down. On March 1, 2009, just before the stock market hits bottom he has $955,736 in his total Bond Fund and $519,680 in his total stock market fund. ($1,475,416 combined) Starting in March 2009 he took his monthly withdrawals equally from both funds. On February 2020 he has $2,598,449 left.

Peter also retired on October 2007 and had $2 Million in retirement and put it all in a 60-40 Mutual Fund. On March 1st he had $1,164,377 in his Balanced 60-40 Mutual Fund (FBALX) He took an inflation-adjusted starting amount of $6666.00 a month out of that fund from October 2007 to February 2020. So, in the end, on February 2020 he had $2,489,195 left.

Why the difference? Because Peter used a balanced mutual fund that was selling stocks during the Great Recession (due to the investment having 60% in stocks). While Jim only withdrew from his bond funds during the 2007-2009 stock market crash.

Most of us old folks who are retired have 40-60% of our portfolio in Bond Mutual Funds and ETF's.  Typically much of their return is the monthly dividends.  With Treasury Bills near 1%, the dividend yields will eventually crash and hurt returns.  Right?

I belong to an investment club connected with a megachurch.  Most of the members are baby boomers. One of the main pieces of advice given to us by a wide variety of speakers is to not sell your stocks in a panic during a bear market or even in a huge market crash.  (Such as 2000-2002 or 2007-2009)  Instead, during a bear market, we should be buying stocks not selling them.

During the first 10 days of this crisis, we all were cocky and acted like this was not a big thing.  But as the stock market kept falling and it appeared our political and business leaders were failing us, more and more members of the club reported that they had sold most or all of their stock investments and went to bond funds.

Now the Bond Market has even turned against us.  During the last 5 days, I have seen drops in bond mutual funds that were more extreme than even the Great Recession.  Even ultra-short bond ETF's like GSY has dropped in value significantly.

So I am having some upcoming life changes, and was hoping I could get some advice on filling out the 2023 W4. My end goal would be to get as close to not owing, but also not having too much of a refund at the end of the years as possible. Although, it doesn't need to be perfect. I just do not want it weighed heavily one way or the other. 

I am currently married and file jointly. I am making \~130,000/year and my spouse makes \~75,000/year. We have 1 dependent. We have some changes coming up, and I plan to redo both of our W4s. 

Starting next week, my spouse will be starting a new job making \~230,000-250,000/year. My spouse is pregnant and will only be working at the new job for about 3-6 weeks before needed to take a 3 month leave. After 3 months, my spouse will return to work full time at the job with the above salary. Obviously this will also increase our dependents to ""2"" come 3-6 weeks from now. 

My question is, what would be the best way to fill out our W4s to get as close to my original goal as possible? I am pretty new to the new W4s and am a bit confused. I am also not sure how my spouse taking a 3 month leave should be taken into consideration when adjusting our W4s. Will this change the timing of when to submit new W4s, etc.? A lot of threads say to use the calculator, but it requires things like paystubs, but we won't have access to these as this will be a brand new job. However, my spouse will need to fill out a W4 prior to employment within the next week. 

Any advice would be much appreciated! The more detailed, the better as I will also use this as a learning situation to be able to better adjust these W4s going forward as well. Thanks!",Yes,Yes,No,Yes,No
14tp2yh,CHB12312,"Recommendations on personal finance podcasts/videos/books vs financial advisor

I was looking for some advise/recommendations regarding personal financing with some major changes that are happening in my life. I currently average 130k a year. I have two dependents (young children in daycare-AKA second mortgage) and my spouse is currently making \~70k a year but starting in a week will be making \~230-250k a year. We currently invest into our 401/403b and have a decent emergency fund on the side (as much as we can invest with currently having the costs of daycare/dependents). With my spouses income increasing significantly, we are obviously looking deeper into how to invest our money moving forward. It is important to note we also have \~350K in combined student debt for which we are about 5 years into PSLF payments (fingers crossed in 5 more years the remainder will actually be forgiven and we won't get screwed with an even higher balance after accrued interest)

I was considering a financial advisor, but I have heard a lot of mixed opinions on whether it is worth it and I don't want to lose out on a lot of money long term. I also considered maybe seeing if a financial advisor could help screen over our situation and start a portfolio and then we take it from there for a flat fee (if this is a thing?). 

However, I am also interested in learning more about personal financing myself. I feel like I have a decent understanding of the basics. I know to max out pre-tax accounts like 401k/403b first. Also maxing out the HSA (especially since I have dependents) which can also be used as a mini retirement account later in life. I have heard mixed things on backdoor roth (seems like some ppl say its worth the hassle, others think it is a minimal benefit for the work you put into it/risk of messing something up with taxes). So I keep going back and forth on whether to do this. However, when it comes to the more detailed stuff such as managing the stocks/bonds (what to put where) and then considering further investing of left over money in other index funds vs doing other things with the remaining money, this is where I feel less confident and don't want to make a detrimental mistake.

I guess my question is... is is worth working with a financial advisor with our current situation/incomes? Or should I be doing more research and trying to manage it myself? If the consensus is to manage it myself, does anyone have any advice on the better books/podcasts/videos that can get me started in starting to research this stuff?

I needed some recommendations on the best way to fill out our W4s. End goal is to get as close to breaking even as possible (not owe too much, but not get too big of refund). 

Current situation: I make \~130k/year and my spouse was making \~80k/year. I believe we filled out the W4 by checking the 2(c) option on both of our W4s. We have both worked full time this year up until now. 

Upcoming situation: I will continue to make \~130k/year. However, my spouse started new employment earlier this week and will now be making \~220-250k/year (170k base and the rest with call pay, productivity bonuses, etc.). The caveat is that my spouse will likely work 4-6 weeks and then be taking a 3 month leave for the birth of a child. After that, my spouse will return to work full time. 

I am trying to decide the best way to fill out our W4s with this new change. I know to list the dependents on my spouses W4 (higher income W4). I hear the online calculator is the most accurate, however, my spouse won't get a pay check for \~ 3 weeks and even then it may not be the most accurate as it will be smaller than some other paychecks that will have call pay. 

What would be the best way to go about filling out our W4s to achieve my original goal? Here are the options I was thinking:

1: Using option 2(B) the multiple jobs worksheet as that uses both of our projected incomes. If I go this route, I believe we only fill this out on my spouses (higher income) W4, correct? And leave it blank on mine? 

2: Using the 2C option. However, I have heard mixed opinions on this. Is our income difference too much for this option? If so, what would it result in? Withholding too much from our paychecks?

So my spouse just started a new job and the salary is going from 80k to ~230k. The yearly contribution to the 403b is currently around 7k from her previous job. Obviously we will have a pretty significant income jump. She will also have to take off 3 months. So she will essentially work a total of 3 months by the end of year. She is getting a pretty nice sign on bonus and I still work so money shouldnâ€™t be an issue.

Two questions..

1) Is there a max per paycheck that you are aloud to contribute to your 403b?

2) If the above answer is â€œnoâ€â€¦ then does it make sense to start off with a large contribution towards her 403b (like 40%) for those 3 months to try and max out the rest of her 403b limit before the end of the year to try and take advantage of the pre-tax dollars and then switch back to a normal contribution in 2024?

We bought our house a few years back in early 2019. It was around 325k at the time with 4.375%.

We wanted a bigger house (we were renting) because we were having a baby at the time. We were able to get this house using a â€œdoctors loanâ€ knowing when my wife became an attending, income would significant change.

Itâ€™s now 2023 and we still owe 295k. I was just reviewing our personal finances as she just became an attending physician and our financial situation has obviously changed. However I am shocked after almost 5 years of ~$2,200 payments that we still owe 295k. 

I was looking at a mortgage statement form last month and it shows $500 towards principal, $1000 interest, ~$800 escrow. Seems crazy (although I understand without a down payment it will be higher). It just feels kind of defeating. 

So I guess I have a few questions with with our upcoming lifestyle changes taking place. 

1) From my research on this thread, I hear that typically you shouldnâ€™t focus on paying down mortgage as itâ€™s considered a low interest investment and money would be better focused elsewhere (such as maxing out 401ks, HSA, back door roths, etc). 

But with us having never put down a down payment, should we save up and try and put down 15-20% to lower the total loan some so we are not paying so much in interest? Or just focus our extra money elsewhere?

2) is this normal for only 1/4 of your total mortgage payment to actually go towards the principal? If soâ€¦ thatâ€™s lame. If not, what could I be doing wrong?",No,Yes,No,No,Yes

This is my current plan, please let me know if there is any adjustments I could make/add to further optimize our portfolio. Obviously our long term goal is to set up a nice retirement, but I also don't want to invest so much that we have no disposable income to enjoy things given that we have worked so hard to get where we are financially. 

For the year of 2024, this is my plan....

Me: Max out my 401k, set up a ""backdoor roth"" and max this

Spouse: Max out her 403b. Also set up and max out a backdoor roth for her. Her company also offers an additional 457 plan. ***Should we max out both her 403b AND 457 plan???***

We also are going to be on a high deductible plan so we plan to Max out HSA contributions each year as well

1) Should I max out both my spouses 403b AND 457? Is this overkill?

2) Is there any changes you would make to this plan?

My job offers a 401k. My spouses job offers a 403b and also has the option for a 457 (due to my spouses higher income). We also have an HSA account. We are also considering back door Roth accounts for the both of us.

However, my concern is that so much of our income would be towards retirement, and we would have less disposable income. I also worry that if for some reason the PSLF didnâ€™t work out, that all of that interest would accrue and all of our money would be tied up in retirement accounts and I wouldnâ€™t have enough to flat out pay off the loans.

So my spouse and I were covered under her health insurance through her employer. She left her job 7/10/23 and I switched over to my employers health insurance plan. She elected to stay on her plan via Cobra for the month of July because she was pregnant and due to deliver in July. She stayed on Cobra because she was close to her out of pocket max and if she switched to my health insurance, it wouldnâ€™t have covered her delivering at the hospital she was planning to deliver. 

She ended up delivering at the end of July. From my understanding you can terminate Cobra coverage at any time (pay on a monthly basis). I had called my HR before any of this happened and explained our situation. I asked if she terminated her coverage starting August 1st, if that would be considered a â€œqualifying life eventâ€ to allow me to place her in my employers health insurance. They told me that yes it would be because she is losing health coverage. We sent an email last week asking to terminate her Cobra after July 31st. 

However, now I am doing further research, and many websites are saying that you can terminate cobra at any time, but this is NOT considered a â€œqualifying life eventâ€ and that you would not be able to be added to a spouses insurance plan unless it was during open enrollment or you had another qualifying event. This is NOT what my HR told me when I called. Is this true? If so, I have no idea what to do because we have now emailed Cobra asking to terminate and I am worried they are going to deny my attempt to get her on my health insurance and she is going to be left without health insurance until next open enrollment which would be terrible as she just had a baby and will likely need multiple follow ups. 

What do I do? Is it true that this will not qualify as a life event and that I am not going to be able to get her on my insurance? If so, what options do I have. Do we try and call Cobra back on Monday and ask them not to cancel the coverage and just get screwed with $600 monthly payments until my next enrollment period?

My question is, what should we focus on next. Here are my thoughts:

1)  My spouses employer offers a 457b NON-governmental plan. This could be an additional $22,500 pre-tax dollars. However, I am concerned about it being non-governmental as we are young and it would probably be close to 25-30 years before we retire. That is a long time to have money in an account that we could potentially lose if things went south with the company. Realistically, it would probably never happen as it is a well known hospital with a current bond rating of AA, but you never knowâ€¦ a lot can change in 25-30 years. 

2) choosing a taxable brokerage account and start contributing to this post tax. We lose out on the pre-tax deductions, but at least I know it is safe and not subject to the employer staying in business

Mortgage: originally 330k, owe about 290k, monthly mortgage payment around $2,300

We have two children. One in daycare which is about $1,400/month and our other child is about to start so we will probably pay around $2,800 a month for daycare at least for the next year until the older child goes to school (so much money :( )

Other monthly costs such as utilities, food, gas, etc.

We have paid almost nothing so far due to the COVID forbearance. Likely wonâ€™t have high payments for another year and half or two due to not needing to re certify income yet.

Going to start maxing out my 401k, her 403b, her 457b and plan to do a back door Roth for both of us. Also plan to max out HSA. This will hopefully reduce our taxable income by a lot, reduce our student loan payments, and start catching us up for saving for retirement.

With the remaining money I am considering placing into a HYSA until closer to the 5 year mark to make sure that PSLF actually works. That way if for sone reason it fell through, I could dump that money on it to help pay it off.

What do you guys think? Are we in a decent place financially? Do my future goals seem reasonable? Is there any changes I should make? Am I putting too much of our income towards retirement/investment accounts (I.e maybe hold off on the 457b for now or something?)

I appreciate any advice.",Yes,Yes,No,Yes,No

Here are the current numbers....

Married filing jointly with 2 children. We are in our mid 30s. Combined annual income of about 360-380k/year (recently increased to this amount, previously around 190k)

Auto loan \~$30,000 at 4%. Second car is paid off and worth about 16k 

Mortgage: 290k (original 325k) at 4%. House is now worth 500k in current market

Student Loans: I have about 120k and my spouse has about 225k. We are currently pursuing PSLF. Both 5 years into it. Currently low monthly payments (<$10) because still using pre-covid income. This will change obviously. Our plan is to make the minimum payment on SAVE plan for another 5 years and hopefully have this forgiven

401k- $95,000 and a 403b with $100,000

HYSA $15,000; checking $12,000

Sadly with 2 children have to pay around $3200/month in daycare costs (hoping when the one starts going to kindergarten that the before/after day care will be cheaper?

Leftover pay after all our expenses each month: About $5,000-$6,000/month

**Our current plan:** Max the 401k, 403b, max backdoor roth for both of us, max HSA. My spouse also qualifies for a 457b which we are considering maxing as well. The largest stressors for me is the student loans. Obviously if PSLF works out, this will make a huge impact on our financial situation. However, I am a pessimistic, so I would like to be prepared in case for some reason it doesn't work out in 5 years. So my thought was taking the extra 5-6k we make each month and just dumping it into a HYSA so that way if at 5 years the PSLF doesn't work, I can use that amount to pay off the majority of student loans. If PSLF does work out, great I will invest/use that money to pay off any other debts at that time

This above plan may change some once we have to recertify incomes in the next 1-2 years as we will then likely have a decent sized student loan monthly payment (not sure how much this will be with out debt to income ratio).

How does our path to FI look so far? I often stress with the large amount of student debt and can't help but feel like FI is far off for us. It feels even harder with the cost of everything going up with inflation and childcare costs being so expensive. We are in medicine, so we are getting a bit of a late start. Is there any other adjustments to our plan that you would recommend? I appreciate any advice/feedback.

I am trying to evaluate whether or not I'm ready to buy a new car. I know a car isn't a ""smart"" financial move; that's not what I'm trying to figure out here. More like do I need to have anything else in order before I make this purchase. 

My financial picture:

* 36 years old
* 6-month emergency fund
* $34k invested in 403b
* $20k saved for new car
* $10k in additional savings (outside of EF)
* Gross annual pay: $75,000
* Debt includes $82k mortgage balance and $129k in student loans (I know this number is astronomical. Mistakes were made in my early 20's. Interest has killed me because the original amount of these loans was only about half of this. Good news is I'm a teacher and this balance is about to be forgiven through PSLF. Just waiting on MOHELA to process my last form).
* No other debt
* I feel I'm a little behind in retirement savings, but I'm a single parent and for years I was trying to get on solid financial ground. It's just the last 2-3 years I've gotten on solid ground and been able to contribute a nice chunk to retirement. I'm also a teacher and in addition to the 403b, I will be eligible for a pretty good pension upon retirement.
* Take home pay after taxes, insurance, and 15% to 403b: $1900/paycheck
* I save an additional $400/paycheck to various sinking funds, so net after additional savings is $1,500/paycheck or $3,000/month
* Total monthly bills: $2,200. That's everything - mortgage, food, utilities, gas, car insurance, student loan payment, medication, subscriptions.

Car information:

* I want to buy a new SUV that costs $38k. I plan on doing a $20k down payment (I have been saving for about 5 years). I've been driving my current car for 10 years. It's not necessarily on its last leg, but repairs are starting to get more expensive (just dropped $1900 on it a few months ago).

I've been working on my 2022 tax return (largely to decide if I need to make a Q4 estimated tax payment or if I already paid enough in the first three quarters), and I discovered a funny bug in TurboTax.  I prepared my return in both FreeTaxUSA and TurboTax, and FreeTaxUSA showed a refund that was hundreds of dollars larger.  After going through the forms, I found the difference on line 8 of Form 8959 (Additional Medicare Tax, where household income over a certain threshold is taxed an extra 0.9%).  The value on Form 8959 line 8 comes from Schedule SE line 6, and FreeTaxUSA brought it over just fine, but TurboTax doubled it, resulting in hundreds of dollars more in tax.

As I messed around trying to fix the problem, I eventually figured out that TurboTax has two versions of Schedule SE, which show up as ""Sch SE-T"" and ""Sch SE-S.""  I also figured out that TurboTax uses Sch SE-T for self-employment income that's attributed to the first-named person on a joint return and Sch SE-S for self-employment income attributed to the second-named person (I suspect the ""T"" stands for ""taxpayer"" and the ""S"" stands for ""spouse"").  In any event, when I change my return so the person with the self-employment income is named first (and TurboTax uses Sch SE-T), the error on Form 8959 goes away.

Let me preface this by saying I assume I'm wrong / missing something, because everyone seems to know that bonds are an important part of one's portfolio (specifically, they help reduce volatility, and the closer you get to retirement, the more of your portfolio they should make up).  I keep wondering, though, don't bonds reduce volatility at the expense of returns?  Assuming that's right, what if you simply didn't care about volatility (you have nerves of steel or whatever) and had a flexible enough time-horizon that you could wait out any downturn or otherwise minimize sale of stocks that are down?  Bottom-line: Would an all-stock portfolio outperform a portfolio with bonds across the long term?

Even if we imagine a worst-case scenario in which a major downturn coincides with your retirement, wouldn't decades of maxed-out growth help your overall position (again, assuming that's what you'd get by being all in stocks)?  Sure, your portfolio would be down -- maybe way down -- but it'd be down from a higher high, right?  Also, it's not like you're going to liquidate your entire portfolio the day you retire -- you'd only sell enough for that week or month or whatever, so while it sucks to sell low, there'd be plenty other times when you'd get to sell at record highs (assuming a long enough retirement), and wouldn't continuing to max out growth be beneficial during retirement, as well?

I assume people have run simulations on this and concluded that we're better off with bonds (and an increasing amount of bonds as we approach retirement), but it's just never made sense to me.

When total income from multiple jobs exceeds the social security maximum and excess social security tax is withheld, an employee can get the excess refunded at tax time ([https://www.irs.gov/taxtopics/tc608](https://www.irs.gov/taxtopics/tc608)).  How does this work on the employer side, though?  Given a single job, when an employee reaches the social security maximum, both the employee AND the employer stop paying their respective 6.2%, right?  In the case of an employee with multiple jobs, though, do the employers just end up overpaying social security for the employee?  Or do they somehow get their excess payments refunded, too?  Are refunds to employers (if there are any) pro-rated based on how much the employee earned from each employer?

My reason for asking actually has to do with self-employment income in addition to W-2 income.  To make things simple, let's suppose someone earns exactly the social security maximum ($147k for 2022) in W-2 income and another $147k in self-employment/1099 income.  The employee only has to pay social security tax on $147k, but what about the employer side?  Can the entire employer responsibility be put on the W-2 employer and the self-employment/1099 income be taken free of social security tax (thus netting the self-employed individual an additional 6.2%)?

I'm paid semi-monthly, and as a result of a payroll error, basically my entire mid-August paycheck went into my 401k.  My company quickly issued a paper check for the correct amount and told me the 401k side would be corrected within a couple of weeks.  Now that my end-of-month paycheck has come through (with everything correct), I logged into my 401k account to see how they handled the correction.  What they did was liquidate and withdraw a dollar amount equal to the huge mid-August contribution minus the sum of the correct mid-August contribution and the correct end-of-August contribution.  That works in dollar terms, but in terms of shares, I'm short of where I should be by a decent amount due to market movements between the middle and end of August.

I really want this fixed this so I end up with the number of shares I would have had if this hadn't gotten messed up in the first place, but I thought I should ask on this sub first.  Is this normally how employer errors are corrected?  If not, how could they do better?  If they give me the missing shares in the form of an additional employee contribution, I'll still end up losing some tax-sheltered space (since I expect to hit the $20,500 limit).

y0jpbx,cloister-fuck,"Iâ€™ve done some tax loss harvesting. When using losses to offset gains/income, where do dividends fit in? What about interest?

As I understand it, realized investment losses can be used to offset an unlimited amount of realized investment gains.  If there are still losses beyond that, those losses can be used to offset ordinary income up to a maximum of $3,000.  And if there are still losses beyond that, they can be carried forward to the next tax year, at which point the process starts over with offsetting realized investment gains, etc.  (All of my realized losses are short term, so Iâ€™m glossing over short term vs. long term gains and losses.)

Anyway, assuming the above is correct, I just wanted to ask where dividends fit in.  Are they realized investment gains (subject to unlimited offset)?

I'm having a bit of a tough time picking what insurance we should get for next year. Some context: My wife will almost certainly max out any limit that she has.

There's some injections/back issues that are in play for next year too. The rest of the family (me and the kid) are generally very healthy, and don't really go to the doctor that much, mostly just generic preventative type stuff. Obv could change, but that's been the history.

My options are:  
Traditional: $441/month (fam), $1k deductible (personal), $3k deductible (fam), 20% co-insurance for most services, $4k max OOP (personal), $12k max OOP (fam), co-pays are flat fees depending on the service

HDP: $310/month (fam), $2k deductible (personal), $4k deductible (fam), 20% co-insurance for more services, $6k max OOP (personal), $9.1k max OOP (fam), co-pays are 20% for all services, company kicks in $1,200 as a side benefit to the HPHD

The way that I'm thinking about this:

The wife will max out the OOP most likely regardless of the limit. The fam will likely not, but could obv. If the wife maxes her OOP, on the trad we're paying \~9k (440\*12+4000) + whatever the rest of the fam needs. On the HDHP we're paying \~9.7k ($310\*12+6000), less the $1.2k that work kicks in. Also less the tax benefit of the HSA which will max out (or approx $7k \* 25%) so -1.7k in taxes.

Also, if it happens that worst case the whole get super sick, the Traditional plan has 8k in extra OOP that we'd have to cover over the wife's limit, where as with the HDP there's only a max of 3k in extra costs we'd have to cover.

How would I figure out how much tax I actually paid on my business income when it's rolled into the total family income on my 1040 tax return?

At the end of the year, we either get money back or owe them more money, some portion of that would apply to the business income/taxes part of the family.

But that 30% that I estimated would just be just that. An estimate. What is the real tax paid on my business income?

Assuming it's at the marginal tax rate on top of my pay seems bad because that's assuming that it's all 'after' other money we make. Which isn't really accurate.

Assuming that it's at the effective tax rate that we paid on total income seems plausible, but means that credits/deductions the family got for the year would affect the estimated tax rate. This does however seem like the better of the two methods.

jfhijs,code-baby,"How much should I have invested in my ESPP as a % of my total retirement savings?

Hello everyone,

I've been reading a number of the threads here, and some really good advice, so thanks in advance!

&amp;#x200B;

My wife and I are blessed that we have a (relatively) decent amount of income we are able to put towards retirement savings each month given recent life/job changes, but now we are stuck trying to figure out where to invest the money.

I have an ESPP plan that we (almost) max out each pay period for $450/month (max $600/month), and 401k contributions are \~$1,500 per month (well past the max for the company match point, which nets us another +$600/month).  Thus far we have not sold any of the stock as we feel that the company is on a solid upward trajectory, we were trying to avoid short term capital gains taxes, and because the raw amount was not enough to spend much time thinking about.

Right now, we have \~$5k in company stock (mix of long term and short term at this point), and \~$75k in 401 savings (mostly large cap targeted retirement date funds through Fidelity if it matters).  The primary question is, when does the stock % become too high that I'm too tied to strongly to my companies results?  And/or should I sell some of it an invest it in something else?

Side question that I have (after reading this article [ESPP Contributions)](https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/8oso8o/how_much_should_i_contribute_to_my_employee_stock/), is should I be selling the stock right way and trying to reinvest it in something else?  I understand the relative value of selling it immediately, as I can capture the return on investment and put it somewhere else.  But that feels like it only nets me value if I can invest it into something that would have a higher return than the expected return of the company stock, is that correct?  The $$ profit realized on the stock is something that I would realize in the generalize long term regardless of when sold, so I think it would just be a question of which investment generates the highest likely return (company stock vs other investment)?

Final question, should I be maxxing out the ESPP for the remainder of the $150 per month?  One of the reason that we haven't thus far is for diversifications reasons, but related to my main question, that might not be something that I need to worry about and it might just be a fancy buzz word that misapplying.  The choice to max it out would probably involve putting less towards the 401k contributions, or not making extra payments on the mortgage as right now we're not strongly considering other life style changes to reduce expenses and save more.  (But we might in the future.)

And after typing this and re-reading, I guess one other thought is that we should consider selling the long term options and using those proceeds to max out the new stock purchases and capture a second round of discount/return.  Is that the right way to think about it?

&amp;#x200B;

Edited since I didn't say it specifically before:  I get a 15% discount on the ESPP purchases, and it's discounted from the 'lower of the purchase date or start of period'.

Evening,

I see much advice about having an emergency fund, and it being 3m to 6m worth of expenses, which makes sense for a single person, but how should I adjust that for a 2 income family?

The lady and I operate on the idea that it's very unlikely that both of us will lose our job at the same time (very different industries) and so we are taking the lower of our incomes, assuming that's 'fixed' and then calculating how much we'd need to survive with just that income for 6 months.  Is that reasonable method?

Numbers based example: 1 person makes 70k/year, another makes something higher.  So monthly income if 1 person loses their job is at least 70k\*.70 (taxes) or \~4k/month.  Our semi-committed expenses are \~$5,500 per month.  So our emergency fund is \~$10k.

Also, from what I can tell, we can both contribute 6k/year to an IRA (combined between Traditional and Roth) so we can contribute 12k total, is that right?

We contribute 17% of my paycheck to my company's 401k (company kicks in another 6%) so that I max out the 19k yearly limit, plan to contribute 6k/year to each of our Roth IRAs in perpetuity, she is just now eligible for her company 401k, so we'll start contributing \~6% of her income to that (which maxes out the company match), and increase to the 20k limit over the next two or three years as incomes hopefully go up.

We also contribute \~5k total per year to HSAs at both of our companies.

The CC debt is gone (except revolving monthly spending for cash back rewards), the family debt is gone, student loans are down to 55k (and holding while interest is free) mortgage is down to 210k and we're paying it off on a 13 year timeline.

&amp;#x200B;

All of this 'feels' like I'm on the right track, but I find it really hard to get a sense of if we'll be ok in retirement at this rate or not.  Things that throw me for a loop:

* We're 'making' 200k right now, but in no way do we live like we do.
   * Given how much we put towards retirement (which we obviously wouldn't do in retirement)
   * We max out the DCFSA for our kid (thanks gubbament for the free money!) which we won't have in retirement
   * We're aggressively paying off the mortgage which we won't have in retirement
   * We have half baked plans to have another kid in another year or so, and then move into a new house \~2 years after that but rent our current house, and I've no idea how to think about how that will affect the long term plans

&amp;#x200B;

So it's really hard to know are we on track for a similar quality of life, something worse, something better?  If I just ignore the retirement savings, DCFSA, and mortgage, that's almost 50k a year in extra income that we don't 'need' to have the same quality of life.  So is it correct to assume that if we have retirement income of 150k, we'd be in \~the same boat?

Also I have no idea how to think about inflation.  A quick calculation on this site:

[https://smartasset.com/retirement/retirement-calculator](https://smartasset.com/retirement/retirement-calculator)

Suggests that 125k/year in income now may need to be \~225k/year to 'feel' the same.

pybkyx,code-baby,"Use HELOC to Pay for (part of) Student Loans

The wife and I are considering taking out a HELOC (in Jan) to pay down our student loans.

The loans are at a blended \~5.5%, while the HELOC would be \~3.25% with no fees to take out the loan.

We diligently pay our bills / mortgage / cc bills so that we have no revolving debt.  We've been abstaining from paying student loan bills for the last 1.5 years because no interest and instead shoving the money into our retirement accounts.  And we have no issues with the actual payments of the student loans, we're more just considering ways to reduce interest.

I'm aware of the concept of not trading unsecured debt for secure debt (no one wants to lose their house due to not paying their student loans), but the opportunity to reduce our interest rate is tempting.

We have also considered using a private company to refi the loans into something with a lower interest but most of what I can find is either 4.00%+ or includes fees to refi which feels like throwing away money.  If it matters at all, on our current time table, the student loans will be paid off in \~5.5 or 6 years.  Alternatively if my research just sucks, and there's somewhere I should look to refi them with better rates / lower fees, that would be great too!

As the title implies, I don't know what the best bet is from a long term standpoint.

My newer stock (in the last year or two) has an average appreciation of \~30%, and would be taxed as short term capital gains on the profits. But my net cash in hand would be higher since gains are notable less (higher basis) and thus less taxes.

The older stock (older than 2 years) has an average appreciation of \~200%, but would be taxed at more favorable rates.

So it mostly comes down to a question of should I recognize the gain now and pay the taxes now or wait till later? One factor that I'm considering is that in future years we will likely go over the Roth ITA contribution limit, so we might better off selling now and recognizing the income so that if we sell in future years we don't price our self out of that option.

One area that we think that we have a ton of opportunity is our 'grocery' spending. This generally includes anything that we'd buy at a grocery store including places like Wally World.

So from a practical standpoint, this would include actual groceries, beer, special foods (fancy cheeses, meats) health and beauty stuff (makeup, vitamins), baby stuff (food mostly) and household stuff (cleaners, bug spray, small kitchen stuff). Ideally we'd subdivide that into some other groups to have a better sense of where the money is going and where we have room to cut back.

Nationwide protests have cast a spotlight on racism and inequality in the United States. Now a major bank has put a price tag on how much the economy has lost as a result of discrimination against African Americans: $16 trillion.

Since 2000, U.S. gross domestic product lost that much as a result of discriminatory practices in a range of areas, including in education and access to business loans, according to [a new study](https://ir.citi.com/NvIUklHPilz14Hwd3oxqZBLMn1_XPqo5FrxsZD0x6hhil84ZxaxEuJUWmak51UHvYk75VKeHCMI%3D) by Citigroup. It's not an insignificant number: By comparison, [U.S. GDP](https://www.bea.gov/news/2020/gross-domestic-product-2nd-quarter-2020-second-estimate-corporate-profits-2nd-quarter) totaled $19.5 trillion last year.

And not acting to reverse discriminatory practices will continue to exact a cost. Citigroup estimates the economy would see a $5 trillion boost over the next five years if the U.S. were to tackle key areas of discrimination against African Americans.

""We believe we have a responsibility to address current events and to frame them with an economic lens in order to highlight the real costs of longstanding discrimination against minority groups, especially against Black people and particularly in the U.S.,"" wrote Raymond J. McGuire, a vice chairman at the bank and the chairman of its banking, capital markets and advisory team.

Wall Street itself has also faced accusations for years of discriminatory practices against African Americans, such as limiting approval for mortgages or not providing enough banking options in minority neighborhoods, which are among the damaging actions identified by Citigroup researchers.

Specifically, the study came up with $16 trillion in lost GDP by noting four key racial gaps between African Americans and whites:

* $13 trillion lost in potential business revenue because of discriminatory lending to African American entrepreneurs, with an estimated 6.1 million jobs not generated as a result
* $2.7 trillion in income lost because of disparities in wages suffered by African Americans
* $218 billion lost over the past two decades because of discrimination in providing housing credit
* And $90 billion to $113 billion in lifetime income lost from discrimination in accessing higher education

As a result, Citigroup urges a slew of actions to reverse discriminatory practices and boost GDP over the next five years, including addressing the wage gap suffered by African Americans and promoting diversity at the top within banks and companies.

I also max out my 403b (19.5k per year), max out my fsa ($2750) but even deducting those two things from my taxable income, I think I might still hit the limit. Wondering if I should start to cut back on the overtime towards the end of the year so I don't hit the limit so I don't have to deal with the headache or is that dumb?

p1lsn2,CoffeeQID,"(NY) Surprise medical bill question

Got a \~$30,000 surprise medical bill in the mail. Long story short, on Halloween last year of 2020 I fractured my nose surfing and had to get \~20 stitches in the ER. I actually work as an RN at the hospital I was treated and have their employee insurance so obviously I was covered and everything SHOULD have been in-network. The ER doc asked me if I wanted plastics to stitch up my nose. I'm 28 years old so of course I said yes as I didn't want horrible scarring. As soon as the plastic surgeon walked up to my stretcher, the first thing I said was ""are you in-network?"" ""I work here at the hospital and have the employee insurance"". He assured me he was and not to worry.

6 months later I get the $30,000 bill. Insurance cut me an out-of-network benefit check for \~$3,000 which I gave to the provider. Provider still wants the other \~$27,000. Someone showed me a link to this thing where you can sign and send copies to your insurance and provider and apparently, I guess it absolves you of responsibility? I already tried appealing insurance for more money, it was denied. The provider stated to me that they also appealed and I'm assuming it was also denied as they just sent me another bill in the mail. 

Here is the link: [https://www.dfs.ny.gov/system/files/documents/2020/07/oon\_aob\_form.pdf](https://www.dfs.ny.gov/system/files/documents/2020/07/oon_aob_form.pdf)

I work for a major hospital group in my state. I have a blue cross blue shield pos plan. I assumed this was health insurance.

Ended up getting a $30,000 bill in the mail 6 months later because he ended up being not covered. I filed a dispute with NY State because apparently there's some kind of law that makes it illegal to do this. I filed a dispute with DFS. The bill got knocked down to about $6,000 which is great but still way too much. NY state told me that: ""I have what is known as a self-funded health plan.Â  Under a self-funded plan an employer collects premiums, puts them in a fund, and then pays for the employees' health care costs out of that fund set aside for medical expenses.Â  This arrangement is not considered insurance.Â  You filed a patient dispute with DFS because you don't have insurance subject to NYS legislation that would hold you harmless.""

 ""Want to really make your paperwork complicated? Contribute to your IRA each month and convert it each month. Then you have 12 contributions and 12 conversions to keep track of each year.

Pretty much what the title says and I guess this is more philosophical than a financial question but when we do eventually retire and itch closer and closer to death (think being around 70-80 something), should we keep money in our investments and the bank still at that point? I mean we retire because working becomes more annoying than the money is worth, otherwise we'd keep working all our lives.

I know of course, this might sound dumb because you don't know when you'll actually die but assuming you keep easily enough to keep your housing, food, and medical bills in order for the rest of your life, then wouldn't throwing out the last remaining bits on people and experiences you enjoy make sense? I wouldn't necessarily spend it on materialistic items seeing as those will simply be gone when you die but the rest could leave a lasting impact or even help others. I just keep thinking about this because in Sweden, they do ""death cleaning"" when they're approaching their elderly age in which they throw away or give away materialistic items so their inheritors don't have to go through it all and determine what to do with it all.

I am looking to eventually transfer my shares from Robinhood to the other two as I donâ€™t completely like or trust Robinhood. Despite that, the majority of my investments are through them because I started young and just kept loyal in a way I guess until recently. So my question is simply put, how difficult is it to transfer my shares from my Robinhood account to say my vanguard account? I know thereâ€™s a fee involved and   Iâ€™m wondering if itâ€™s even worthwhile with that fee considering Iâ€™d only be transferring over around $2K worth of investments (less actually, since 10% or approximately $200 of my holdings with Robinhood are crypto but those are much easier to transfer to another crypto wallet than it is with stocks at least as far as I can tell). So is it worth paying the fee to transfer $1800 worth of investments? Adding onto that, would these fees be a flat transfer cost for all my holdings in one fell swoop or will I need to pay a fee for every share I transfer individually? Sorry if these are dumb questions but the answers I found online were kind of confusing.

Update: Questions were properly answered. Thank you guys.",No,Yes,No,No,No

I have it down to two plans, and I want peoples thoughts on what is the better option for me.

I'm only using my base pay for my budget since my bonuses are one time payments that I'll use to save for one time things like a house, grad school, wedding, honeymoon, etc. but that'll be roughly $57k pre tax

**Plan 1:**

Take home pay from work is $5000 but I contribute 10% to my 401K

10upbic,CoookieHo,"What should my net monthly savings be to feel comfortable?

I will be starting a new job, where I will be making considerably more than my new job but the take home will be less because I will investing my money a whole lot more and my COL is also going up.

Currently I make $60k from work and about $25K from my side hustle. I only invest 8% into my 401K and nothing else. I have no money invested into a Roth IRA or HSA or stocks. On a normal month, after monthly expenses including rent, my take home is roughly $3k.

With my new job, I will be making $92.7K base, $18K annual bonus, and $39K performance bonus. I also make about $22k from a side hustle. My work is also giving me $625 per month pre tax for a car allowance if I buy a car 5 years or newer so I'm going to take advantage of that plan. I'm only using my base pay for my budget since my bonuses are one time payments. 

After heavily studying the flowchart on this subreddit, here's the best monthly budget plan I came up with:

**Take home pay (including car allowance) after contributing 15% to my 401K: $5240**

**Total take home including side hustle is \~$7090**

Rent &amp; Utilities: $1650

Car payment, insurance, parking and gas: $975

Gym and medicine: $90

Fun money and subscriptions(only $50): $350

Roth IRA or stocks (I'm having trouble picking which one): $500

Sending Money to Parents: $200

**In all, my total monthly expenditure: \~$4360**

**Net savings: $2730**

I'll use my bonus money to max out my HSA at the end of every year, and I'll make around $40k post tax from all my bonuses.

Regardless, considering how much I'm making, I feel like I'm not putting enough into my savings every month to feel comfortable. I have $40k in my checking right now as my emergency fund, and to save for a house, wedding, etc.

I know the general rule of thumb is to invest 30-35% of your pre tax income, but taking into account only my W-2, I'm only investing 21%. I would not feel comfortable at all with my monthly net savings if I invested 30%.

I know that even though leasing a car won't give me equity in the car, it'll at least make my monthly payments around $250/month cheaper for the car I want over 48 months vs financing the car for the same duration if I were to put down the same amount.

Where the predicament starts is that I currently have a car that I need to sell or trade in. I think it can sell privately between $7.5k-10k.

When I was going to buy the car originally, I was going to put down $5k, as well as whatever I made from the car sale. Now that I'm strongly considering leasing, I'm not so sure it's such a good idea to put down more than the lease minimum since I'm not going to have any equity in the car.

Any idea, advice, suggestions on how to move forward and what would be a good amount to put down?

For reference, I was thinking of leasing a Rav4 Hybrid.",Yes,Yes,No,No,Yes
12esnot,CoookieHo,"Are there graduate student loans that don't charge interest until after graduation or for an extended duration?

I am starting a graduate program next spring which will around $55k. I will be doing it over 2.5 years. I was considering paying out of pocket for that time because I really didn't want to pay a high interest rate student loan. 

However, I was told by someone that there are some graduate student loans out there that don't charge interest for the first few years or until after you graduate. I've looked online but I haven't found any, but maybe I'm not looking in the right places.

My total credit limit is about $60k, and my credit score is around 750.

I am also planning on buying a new car this October

My fiance will be attending a 2 year graduate program in January 2024. She has roughly $25k in federal student loan debt with an avergae of 4% interest. Based on the income she made in the past year, she qualified for the SAVE plan where she'll only have to pay around $42/month up starting next month up until $18k and then the rest of the debt will be forgiven (based on her current income). 

That being said, I expect her income to jump significantly once she graduates and I don't know if she will qualify for the SAVE plan at that point.

Hi!

I (23) am a recent college graduate who wants to maximize my savings in long and short term, but am not very financially literate so I was hoping for some advice.

Background:

I recently started a job with a salary of 60K, and i am assuming that I will get raises and promotions in the future, along with a supplemental income. i put in 8% into my 401K and my company matches 3%. The max my company will match is 37.5% up to 8% of my compensation. How that works is if I were to contribute 8% of my compensation, my company will match 37.5% of that amount. Any additional contribution will not be matched. 37.5% of 8% is a 3% match. I know i should be putting in more than 8% but I am currently cash poor right now due to some personal emergencies. After taxes, 401K, health, etc. i bring home around $4500, including supplemental income. My expenses are roughly $1700/month. I will have a savings of about $14500 (after paying for all my emergencies) at the end of this month and have about $2000 in my 401k which I have not invested into anything (I would like to invest it but have no idea where to start). I have school debt of $21k of which i will start paying $200/month starting next month (unless you guys have a better suggestion. I am moving across the country in July and my moving expenses will be about $1500.

That being said, I'm super excited for the new job and all the new experiences it'll bring.

Update: Thank you all for your input! This blew up so much more than i thought it would. I haven't made a decision but I definitely have a lot more factors to keep in mind. One thing I forgot to mention is that this new job wouldn't start until Feb 2023 .

I (23 almost 24, one year out of college) work as a level 1 data engineer at a software company (1000+ employees) making $60k. I realized that I am underpaid for my position. Normally I'd leave immediately but I have a kickass manager who I would follow to the ends of the earth. I have also applied for other data engineering positions, but all interviewers said they were looking for experienced coders.

My boss has promised me that I will be promoted to level 2 in January, he was actually going to submit the paperwork this month but HR told him it was too late in the year to submit promotional paperwork...The issue is that he also doesn't know how much of a raise I will receive when I am promoted because HR is keeping finances hidden from him as well. Every attempt I have made to get HR to give me an inkling of financial expectations has lead nowhere. This frustration led me to apply for a Technical Sales Engineering job, which I surprisingly got. Money wise, I would be paid 2.5 times my current engineering salary (new salary would be 150k). The issue is that the job would take me out of the software game since it's an electronics company. I want to give my current company a fair shot solely because of my boss and I also want to stay in software, so any advice on how to get HR to tell me what my salary expectations will be?

My employer matches 25% of the first 6% and I make ~120k a year.

if2nw7,CuriousernCurioser,"How to choose a financial advisor/planner.

If you want to do it yourself thatâ€™s fine. If youâ€™d prefer to hire a professional these are the 3 questions to ask. 

1) Are you a CFP? 

CFPs are the cream of the crop in the industry. They go through more extensive education and training and have experience requirements that donâ€™t exist for your average advisor. 

2) Do you charge fees or commissions?

You want to eliminate the conflicts of interest between you and your planner as best as possible. Commissions for trades are the worst compensation structure because they are getting paid regardless of the advice they give. Flat monthly fees are best because the advisor is now being compensated for the advice they give and not just the investments. Fee based and and Fee for assets model are the most common and fine as long as the advisor is worth the advice they are giving. Many of the best planners charge a fee for assets under management because itâ€™s the most lucrative business model and they have no trouble keeping and acquiring happy clients. 

3) What if I wanted to buy a stock?

You donâ€™t want an old school stock picking broker who hasnâ€™t kept up with the times. The evidence is clear that index funds are better than most mutual funds and picking stocks. The advisor should reply with some form of, â€œyou can do whatever youâ€™d like with your money, but if we are going to work together I do whatâ€™s been proven to maximize your chances of success in the long term, and that means I donâ€™t pick stocks and I donâ€™t try and time the marketsâ€. This may seem harsh but if they are willing to let you do it then they have one foot in the old school and a good sign theyâ€™re not truly objective. 

* if you find yourself in some niche like government employee, doctor, dentist, retiree, employee stock options, and can find yourself a specialist who only works with these people and wonâ€™t take on others, this is ideal. Specialists are more valuable in finance for the same reason you want someone who does hips all day to replace yours as opposed to a general orthopedist.

I recently discovered the Treasury Direct Treasury Hunt.

I found that there are matured bonds in my name that I requested more info on about 3 months ago. I am told it takes 6 months for them to get back to you. These bonds are likely paper bonds from my grandma on my mom's side that we have no record of.

Anyway, I just found out my grandma on my dad's side's social security number who passed in 2013 and gave it a search to see if anything came up. It appears there are bond results for her.

If she is the sole person named on these (which is yet to be known) they would go to her heir which would be her only child, my dad.

He is in a Medicaid nursing home. Would the nursing home get the money automatically? Illinois does have a spousal rule where the spouse is allowed the house + 120k in assets. They (my mom) literally lives paycheck to paycheck.

Hey everyone, happy Friday. Iâ€™ve been thinking about this for a couple of weeks now and hoping to get a discussion going about this idea I have,  partially inspired by The Money Guy show. Iâ€™m not risk adverse, but more along the lines of covering my bases â€œjust in caseâ€. 

First tier is the emergency fund (9 months) which is strictly an â€œincome replacement fundâ€ if either my wife or I lost our jobs. 2 months is in a separate bank, the rest in a HYSA.

32, Third-year Teacher in CA. No health issues. I Will be married next year. Due to being in CA, I know I will get taxed by the state. I have several questions. Currently, have PPO through Anthem, and this year have gotten a cleaning at the dentist and an annual physical. Scheduled for wisdom teeth removal in late December, after the enrollment period ends.

Questions:

\-I have a Roth IRA through Fidelity, and they offer an HSA. Would I be able to open one through Fidelity even though my work offers one? If so, how would that work? Any tax implications for doing so?

\-If I can open an HSA through Fidelity, would I invest the money as I do with the Roth (i.e. Target Date Funds)?

\-Did having to pay state taxes for contributions and earnings (and potential capital gains) cause you to not choose an HSA if offered?

\-As far as the wisdom teeth removal surgery, I assume I would be responsible for paying the entire cost of that until the deductible is met; I can then reimburse myself at some point in the future for that surgery?

Question is, if I know I'll need a new car in the next couple of years (06 Corolla, 126K miles), do I plan for that in my savings account? Is it under EF, car repair, or a new fund? 

How do you all organize big future purchases (new car, home improvements, etc?) For example, I've read that since one should know that an HVAC unit will eventually be needed, does one save up for it separately, as part of your emergency fund, or as part of the yearly home maintenance account?

q24f5p,DarkTyphlosion1,"Unsure where to put money from my second job

I am a special education teacher in SoCal, and am starting a second job this weekend (reading tutor; pay for the first student is $35/hour, any others I will be paid will be $30/hour). Starting with 2 hours/week, with as many more students as I want, so monthly payments can vary. Question is, not sure where that second paycheck should go. Here are some financial details:

No debt

8 months EF (HYSA)

Maxing Roth IRA in Dec (w/o second job)

Wedding fund fully funded

Currently saving up for down payment+ closing costs (7.6K down payment, 700 closing costs). Projected to save over 60K in 2 years, with an additional 8K for closing costs. 

Unsure if I should add to the down payment, save up for next year's vacation, add to the EF, or open a brokerage and invest it. This can allow me to re-open my 403B and start contributing again.

q66cz2,DarkTyphlosion1,"Emergency vs Sinking Fund Clarification

As the title says, I want to get a little clarity about emergency vs sinking funds. I know the rule of thumb is to have 3-6 months of EF, which I have 8 months (15.5K currently, the goal is 20K). However, I have been reading more about sinking funds, and I'm a little confused by a couple of things. 

Firstly, I understand that sinking funds are for things like car repairs, annual car fees, Xmas gifts, etc. How many sinking funds should someone have? What are some of your sinking funds?  I think I get overwhelmed by seeing many different categories, and so I get anxious about funding them all. How long does it take you to get to your goal for each one?

For any homeowners, I also know you should have 1% of home value for repair or maintenance each year; if you know you will need a new roof for example, do you make that part of the yearly repair fund or a whole separate fund? How far in advance do you contribute to a sinking fund if you think you will need a new roof in a few years? I'm hoping to buy a home within 2 years and looking to be prepared for any surprises. 

Another question is if you have all of these sinking funds, at what point does an emergency fund actually get used for an emergency?

Expenses havenâ€™t really gone up, biggest monthly expenses are rent (1600) gas (200) and utilities (50). I also am saving 1800 for down payment and maxing out Roth IRA (500). FiancÃ© takes care of groceries, internet and cable. Will start looking for a home in late 2024/early 2025. 
 
With this large raise Iâ€™m getting Iâ€™d like to keep avoiding lifestyle creep. Thinking of putting the entire raise towards my 403B (currently contributing 100/month). 

Questions:

1) is this the best way to make use of the raise? If I save the entire raise, retirement savings would increase from 20% to 27-30%. We are trying to start our family at this time as well. Hence my question. Iâ€™d like to retire between 58-60.

I have a question regarding where to put money for my down payment. On my phone so I apologize for any formatting issues.

Background info: 
Saving up money for a down payment. Goal is 75K by August 2024. Currently have 24K in a home savings account with my credit union. Earning 1.25%, locked up until January 2024.

I also have a Marcus HYSA earning 2.15%, with $100 towards the down payment once the above account closes. 

Question:
Debating if I should divert money starting this month ($1,800/month) to the HYSA since thereâ€™s higher interest, or keep funding the credit union account. My gut says to start funding the HYSA even though I barely have any money in it. 

If I were to withdraw the 24K Iâ€™d pay a penalty.

So as the title says, it is Open Enrollment Season at my work. I currently have a PPO plan but am interested in switching over to an HSA as I have read of its many benefits. Employer will match $50/month. This is for an individual plan. Premiums for PPO: 40/month, HSA would be $0/month.

Anthem Blue Cross PPO: $250 deductible, $20 co-pays, OOP max is $2,500. Currently, only pay $40/month for it.

My wife and I have an unusual situation.  

Due to a combination of factors (inheritance and receiving a lawsuit settlement) we have about $400K in *taxable* VTSAX/VTIAX funds.

Meanwhile, we did a poor job in our younger years setting aside retirement funds.  Our combined Roth 401K and Roth IRA balances total about $115K.  

We're in our late 30's now.  My intention has been to save most of the taxable $400K for retirement purposes, but I hate that it's currently in taxable accounts.

Most of this money was invested between 2017 and 2021 so there's not a ton of capital gains over this period.

We have an appointment with an estate planning attorney tomorrow.  I'm curious what the rest of you think about this...

One of the questions for us is whether we want to stagger the distribution of assets to our children when they turn 25, 30, 35.  

I'm almost 40 years old with a 1-year old kid.  The successors we'd like to use at this point are all in my age bracket or much older.  If my wife and I dropped dead tomorrow, 2 of the 4 people on the list will, for sure, die from old age by the time our kid turns 35.  In other words, they won't be alive to carry out the distribution to our kid.  The younger successors on our list would be in their 70's and could be deceased as well.  Or not of sound mind.

I understand what this provision is trying to accomplish, but it seems like a nightmare for the kids inheriting the money because it stretches the successor responsibilities so far into the future, and potentially puts the assets at risk.

I'm looking to max out my HSA for 2023. There are quite a few factors at play. I had two different HSAs with different companies. 

First, I had a HDHP from 5/31/2023 to 9/1/2023. My total contributions during this time was $1,282.40. I was on the individual plan. 

Then, now I have a HDHP starting 10/1/2023. This time on the family plan so my max contribution goes up to $7,750. There are 4 remaining pay periods for 2023 (I get paid on the 7th and the 22nd). Is this how it works or can I contribute up until tax day of 2024? 

I believe the IRS considers you eligible for the entire month as long as you were covered on the first day of the month. Prorated max contribution considered... So I had 4 months of eligibility on the first HDHP and 3 months remaining of eligibility for the second HDHP. My total max contribution for this year is $4,520.83 minus what I already contributed $1,282.40 = $3,238.43 divided by number of paychecks left (4).

I need some of that good 'ole confirmation bias. 

I've been actively looking for a starter home/townhome in my area, but I'm too hesitantÂ to pull the trigger given the volatility in the market rightÂ now.Â I live in Minnesota. 

Also, I was wondering if I could get your thoughts on the relation between raising interest rates and home prices.

I've been looking into the $17,500 Bank of America grant for first-time homebuyers. It sounds like it'd be a great fit for my situationÂ and help with closing costsÂ and the downpayment.Â

Funds- Currently, I have \~$20,000 in savings but my time horizon is flexible, so I understand if I need to build on this.Â 

Price- Looking around the $225,000 price range, but any further insight on how much I could reasonably afford is much appreciated. What's the general consensus on how much you should spend? Should I focus more on a single family home or settle for a townhome? Is it just preference?Â 

Credit- \~750

Debts- $336 monthly car payment. No student loans or other debt.Â 

Income- $57,000 yearly. $4,769 monthly gross. $3,662 monthly take home pay.

The alternative to purchasing a home right now would be to keep living at home, accumulate money for a larger downpayment, hope for a raise, and then buy a house in the future when I'm more financially prepared. What should I do? Thanks in advance!

wkvs5z,DexterTwerp,"In desperate need of assistance with the homebuying process

Income w/ 401k match: $74,580 
Income: $67,800
S/Oâ€™s income: &gt;35k 
Cash reserves: 30k

I was just recently promoted. Iâ€™m exceling in my career field and will definitely have an income boost within two years again. After the new year, Iâ€™m also getting a merit increase which was 18% last year, but I canâ€™t expect that high this year because it was an outlier. My plan is to buy a nicer house and then rent it out to my significant other as well as another tenant. Even though Iâ€™m going to rent it to close family members and friends, I still would like to do it professionally and have them provide security deposits as well as sign leases.

I also have a side gig that generates an additional $200 each month. This is not included in my income shown above. My S/O income will increase eventually as sheâ€™s switching jobs soon. 

Iâ€™m going through the Bank of America first-time homebuyer program that pays $7,500 in closing costs and 3% of the down payment ($15,000 covered by them if my home was $300,000, nothing additional is required). I was approved for $300k and Iâ€™m going to be looking at houses soon. I believe my interest rate is 5.25% with 5.451% APR, but these are subject to change. My monthly debts are $336 for my $14k car payment, but the car is worth $20k at the very least so Iâ€™m not under water. Itâ€™s also a 2019 with very low miles so itâ€™ll last awhile hopefully. I have 3.5 years left on the loan. 

Given these factors, how much house should I comfortably target for? Iâ€™m pretty keen on having a roommate for awhile until my income increases significantly but itâ€™s not always a safe bet to force yourself to find a roommate you love.

wpkqs2,DexterTwerp,"Is my house hacking strategy good?

I hopefully will be house hacking starting in 2023. Please analyze my strategy and let me know if you see any flaws or risks.

**Financials**

*All the calculations are based on a $2,000 mortgage.*

Income:

Gross: $67,800 yearly $5,688 monthly $2,844 bi-weekly

Net: $52,338 yearly $4,362 monthly $2,180 bi-weekly

Projected rental income (found tenant, ready to sign lease): $10,800 yearly $900 monthly

Current debt-to-income ratio (w/ mortgage included): 41%

Current debt-to-income ratio (w/ mortgage &amp; rental income included): 36%

Emergency fund (cash reserves only, not including payment for closing costs &amp; down payment): \~$12,000

% of net income spent on housing: 46

% of gross spent on housing: 35

% of net spent on housingÂ (w/ rental income): 40

% of gross spent on housingÂ (w/rental income): 31

**Rules of Thumb**

*No more than 30% of your gross monthly income should be spent on housing:*

A $2,000 mortgage puts me at 35%, but with the rental income itâ€™s 31%.

*Your mortgage payment shouldn't put you more than 36% DTI:*

A $2,000 mortgage puts me at 41% DTI, but with rental income itâ€™s 36%.

*The 4x rule (if you spend less than 20% of your current take-home income on debt):*

I currently spend less than 5% of my income on existing debts, so the 4x rule gives me a purchase price of \~$270,000 with no HOA dues. This is currently the price target Iâ€™m aiming for. So although these calculations are based on a $2,000 mortgage from a \~$300,000 purchase price, it will more likely be a $1,800-$1,900 mortgage.

*Emergency fund for household expenses to last at least 6 months:*

Stashing away $2,500 for 6 months puts me at $15,000, but by the time I officially close and have to start paying the loan I should be around there.

**Factors to consider:**

* My girlfriend will live with me, and her income was left out of the loan approval process purposefully to ensure we do not overextend ourselves. My current thoughts are that weâ€™ll just split the mortgage from whatâ€™s left over from the other tenant. Weâ€™ll be paying around $550 each with the current calculations.
* I would need to lose my job and BOTH of my roommates in order for me to be truly swamped. In this case, I could sell my \~$20,000 car and live off my current cash reserves to give me time to find another job or sell the house.
* I shouldn't rely on this but my quoted \~5% interest rate leaves room for improvement, so I could refinance down the line and save money.
* The tenant is only signing a lease for a year, so the rental income is not guaranteed for the life of the loan but hopefully my income will increase in 2 or 3 years to a point where I can cover their portion eventually or find another tenant. 

Are there any flaws in this way of thinking? Any other rules of thumb I should use?Â

yozif4,DexterTwerp,"Job negotiating... Should I accept this new offer?

Here's the rundown.

My current job is with a very solid company. I am fully remote. They offer a retirement benefit of 10% (no match required, fully vested instantly), we work 7.5 hour workdays, admin staff is talking about adding amazing flexibilities like random 'wellness' days, I love my team, and I am very independent which I like, very flexible work schedules, 30 total days of leave (sick, vacation, and bereavement). My salary is currently around $68,000, but we do market research every year to make sure we are keeping up with inflation. Last year it was an 18% increase. That was for being within the top 60% of our industry. This year we are doing top 70% of the industry, but I do not expect it to be as high as 18%. I expect the 5-10% range starting Jan. 1st. I also recently got promoted, so I wouldn't be eligible for another raise for at least another two years.

The new job just offered me $80,000. They have a Cash Balance Retirement account where the company contributes 4 percent of your annual pay and bonus but this doesn't vest until 3 years of service. For the 401k, they match â€œdollar for dollarâ€ up to the first 3 percent you contribute. They then match 50 cents on the dollar for the next 2 percent. You are immediately vested and are free to take the company match with you if you decide to leave the company (no waiting period). Four and a half weeks of leave plus 5 days of bereavement. It would be a hybrid model (I could probably negotiate a remote role) coming into the office once in awhile on Mondays. I live 5 mins from the office. They give a $50 stipend every month for Internet, gym membership, or anything that I could use. There's probably more benefits but those are the most important ones to me.

They seem THRILLED to have me. What should my negotiation tactic be? They realize I am content in my current role. I have another offer on the line and they know it.

This just isn't possible in my area, but is more feasible in a LCOL area. My thoughts are if I hate it there I can move back to my home state and rent out my home in Pittsburgh. This would be 9 hours away. Renting is an option but more difficult with my dog (Belgian Malinois).

&#x200B;

I am 25 single with a dog. I make $95k, expecting a $10k raise and $10k bonus this year. By the time I move in 1 year, I'll have 25k left in loans and 25k for a down payment (in addition to emergency fund). I also max 401k. I've worked at this job for 1 year, it is all remote with clients across the US.

Average starter home in my area \~$450k, or rent nice 1bed \~$2000.

Average starter home in Pittsburgh area \~$250k or rent nice 1bed \~$1500.

&#x200B;

I know the best financial plan would be to wait and save more, but I really want to get out there on my own and start making a life for myself. Absolutely not staying at home any longer than 1 year. I feel like the only realistic way to make my goals happen is moving to a lower cost of living area.

15kr9co,DiabolicDiabetik,"Moving out in a year - prioritize paying student loans or saving?

25, living with parents paying cheap ($500) rent. I plan to move out fall 2024 - I need to get out on my own again but am trying to get in a better financial situation first. I would really love to buy a small home for $300k or under when I move for me and my dog, but realize this may be unrealistic. 

Some numbers:

Income: **$95,000** \-  expecting/hopeful for a $10k raise and $10k bonus in February but TBD.

Private Student Loan: **$60,000 (2.7%, $835/mo.)**

Savings: **$1,000 (4.5%)** \- just spent $10k of this to payoff federal loans, which is why it is low.

Emergency Savings: **$10,500 (4.5%)** 

&#x200B;

Main question: after taxes, 401k, rent/food/all expenses, I have **$3,450/mo**. to put towards my loan, savings or both. **How would you allocate this in my situation?**

I'd like to get that $835 back a month - however even putting 100% of this towards my loan I'll still have around $13k in loans by October 2024. It would also obviously be great to have a larger sum of cash for a down payment. Thoughts, advice?",Yes,Yes,No,No,No

I pay them cheap ($500) rent and am living as frugal as possible. I make $95,000 and have $2,600/mo.

I know the interest rate on the loan is very low, but having that huge debt and high payment really weighs me down. I feel like it's useless debt and will get in the way of me buying a car or home.

I was in a rehab facility January and February last year after surgery.  I would say every other person in the facility was medicaid/medicare.  More on that in a second.

Thanksgiving week I received a bill that the facility hand wrote my forward to address on from a pharmacy out of state.  It was literally an invoice with my name on it, a due date back in August, and a bottom line amount due for a few hundred dollars.  Not a single indication of what the bill was for, when, etc.  I called the 800 number and they told me they would reprint the bill and send it to me.  I gave them my correct address.  The week after Christmas, I got another hand written forward of the exact same bill.  No changes, no updates, except the bill now said 'past due'.

The Monday after New Years, I received another letter, to the correct address from a collection agency saying I had a bill that was being collected on because I failed to pay it in August.  The only associated number was the same one I called before.  They tell you to press '6', then '1', etc, and you get a prompt that indicates you want to pay a on a collection notice.  Since it's the same number, and they have a menu prompt, this can't be an uncommon thing for them.

I got through to a representative, and explained they had been sending bills to the wrong place, I wasn't getting those bills, and when I did, there is no information in the bill as to what it was for.  The rep said they saw I had called to get a reprint, but that I refused to pay the bill.  I asked them if they could send me the actual invoice that i was supposedly missing, and they told me it looked like it was for 2 bills, one back in December of '21 for a partial Medicare copay.  I explained to them I am not on medicare (I still work and have private insurance), and I wasn't in the facility in December.

I asked them to send me an updated invoice to my email, that I think they have some mistakes on the bill, and to ask the collection agency to back down.  I also asked for a reference number for the call so when I called back i would have a case already opened.  She said I just needed to use my 'account id'.

It's been over a week, and I still haven't heard back from them.  What steps do I take next?  I feel I've done my best to figure this out.  It already seems a little shady, so I am not going to keep investing time into digging into this.  At what point will they start putting liens against me or ruining my credit?

Recently been given a medical diagnosis that might leave me unemployed and disabled in 2-3 years. I wont need intensive care, bur without getting into details I wonâ€™t be able to do many job functions (so still could find a job of some kindâ€¦ but not counting on it).

Wife and I (both age 31) a combined income of 200k (120k for me 80k for her) my wife will be at 100k in a few years, so that could be the sole income.  But if I am unable to work at age 32-33 I need to have a good system set up of security.

We have been very financially smart,  but worried about me not being able to bring money in here soon. Here is our set up.


* to start our full net worth is around 730 which is in:
* 25k Savings (was for new house and emergency fund)
* 22K I bonds (was for newhouse and emergency fund)
* 6K HSA
* 100K non retirement brokerage
* 106k roth (with 66K I could technically pull of contributions)
* 50K in 401K
*We have a house that is valued at 400k and we have 3 years to pay it off 
(at 3k a month. we are going 1k over our mortgage but once I got my medical issues I wanted this as a peace of mindâ€¦ sort of so we wouldnâ€™t have to worry about our largest expense. I know this is against popular logic but this is important to meâ€¦ to be able to feel like I took care of the biggest expense while I had my job and health)


**So my real question isâ€¦ where should I be putting any extra money? Through out the next few years ill have 1-1.5K a month potentially I could put in places like Roth, HSA, and non tax brokerage account.**

 I am confident in my wifeâ€™s role so we will have income coming in (100k) and we will have our house paid off right around the time I wonâ€™t be able to workâ€¦. But if I am maxing out my roth (6k), HAS (3.5k) and 401K (30.5k after company match a year) for another 2 years, that still puts us in a great position. 

I realize while not idealâ€¦I have near 160ishK of accessible money for some horrible double loss of employment or something. That includes roth and some avenues not ideal for early use. 

But outside of keep on keeping on this pathâ€¦ what should I be doing with extra money I want to be accessible once I get out of work, the non-retirement brokerage? Bonds? High yield savings account? Any advice welcomed.

**Alsoâ€¦. The last year with my medical diagnosis has left me depressed and suicidalâ€¦ seeing a therapist has literally saved my life and gave me a positive outlook. I encourage anyone to do so if struggling.**

**I fully realize that outside of my health I am blessed with an amazing wife who is gonna help me out as well as a very strong financial start to everything. So i hope the numbers dont come off as a humble brag**

ohmrj0,dipcupdipcup,"Plan to aggressively pay off condo (2.3 years), save for downpayment on house (need 50K more), and modestly invest (6K a year Roth)

Recently married in the US, and we have a net worth of $292k (see break down). We are both 29 years old. We have a small combined monthly income (7.2k) and make a combined 80k after taxes. Both of our jobs don't really offer any retirement account or benefits, so we just fund a roth yearly ourselves.

Due to a generous gift as well as a unique family situation, we are planning to pay off the condo we live in, in 2.3 years. This needs to be done time wise for a family situation far too complicated to explain. To do this, we are paying 4K a month (for the next 2.3 years). The idea is to pay it off in the 2.3 years, any leftover money save up for a down payment for a new house (try to get about 100k, so we are halfway there with 50k savings), and then because of that aggressive strategy, just barely fund our roths (6K each). If we aren't able to save another 50K, after we pay off the condo, we will aggressively save for another year or two since we will own the condo and no mortgage payments. 

The grand idea... is rent out the condo (for 1.5-2k a month) and then use that to pay most of the monthly mortgage on a large house (20-30 year mortgage). Thus, since that is paying off most of the mortgage, our salaries will feel much larger than they are (used for investments, savings, set). 

The downside of this plan, is that we are neglecting our retirement accounts a bit for the next few years, as we might have to dip into savings/the down payment fund to get that 6k a year each. We kinda decide paying off the house and viewing that as our investment for the next few years is our goal.

I wanted to run this plan by here to see peoples thoughts. We have to pay the condo this way. Is focusing on this and the downpayment better then investing for a few years? Should we hold off on the downpayment and make the Roth a priority for the 2-3 years? Funding the roth for 2-3 years is 24-36K that could be for the downpayment. Or is it best to save and do roth and once the condo is payed then aggressively save.


Break down

I hear many claim Roth is best, but why is post-tax better than pre-tax? If the tax rate is the same when putting money in as when taking it out, donâ€™t they equate to be equal, so is tax rate the only factor to look at for comparison? Does it make sense to have both?

I really like the idea of Roth since I know exactly how much I have and donâ€™t need to worry about tax rates come withdrawal time, but I donâ€™t want to let personal preference get in the way of the better financial decision, especially since my marginal tax rate is so high. I (22M) live in CA and am making ~70k/yr which puts me at a 31.3% marginal tax rate: 22% federal + 9.3% CA (though only a ~21% effective tax rate). 

Iâ€™m unsure whether I should choose traditional or Roth for my 401(k). I figure a pro for Roth is that Iâ€™m starting young and plan to contribute ~20% to retirement annually, which should give me a higher retirement income on distributions alone, plus I expect the U.S. to have higher taxes in the future.

kczrha,disgruntIed_giraffe,"Basic Investing Advice to get you started.

I wrote this out for a friend, thought it might be helpful to share here too. The goal is to provide some context for beginners and show how to get started. Iâ€™m open to questions from anyone trying to learn, or critiques from the veterans.

First off the rule of thumb is to only have your emergency fund and expected upcoming expenses in cash, everything else should be invested. Think about how much cash you need, and in the meantime you can start small by investing a little bit each month and increasing your contributions as you get more comfortable. For how you should be investing, Iâ€™m going to recommend putting everything into a Total Stock Market Index Fund.
 
A Total Market Index Fund tracks the performance of the entire US stock market. The way it works is it has almost 3,700 different stocks in it, each weighted based on their total value in the stock market. For example Apple is the biggest company in the US by market value, worth 6.5% of the entire stock market. Microsoft is the next biggest at 5%. So if you have $100,000 invested in a Total Market Index Fund, itâ€™s like you actually have $6,500 invested in Apple, $5,000 in Microsoft, and so on based on each of the 3,700 stocks weighted values.
 
The S&amp;P 500 is another popular index fund. It is comprised of the 500 biggest companies in the US and makes up over 2/3 of the total stock market, so it has a lot of overlap with the Total Stock Market Index Fund, but it has a little less exposure since it excludes the smaller companies. Historically the performances of these two indexes have been nearly identical.
 
The S&amp;P 500 and Total Stock Market have had over 13% annual growth over the last 10 years, so in that timeframe $100,000 invested wouldâ€™ve grown to ~$370,000, which is a great example of how powerful investing is over sitting on cash, but itâ€™s also important to note that past performance does not guarantee future performance. These last 10 years have had particularly strong growth, and Iâ€™d be surprised if it keeps that pace.
 
The Total Stock Market fund and S&amp;P 500 fund are both synonymous with â€œthe Market,â€ and are two examples of low-cost, passively invested index funds. Index funds seek market average returns, but there are thousands of actively managed mutual funds to choose from which are more expensive and exist on the belief that theyâ€™ll â€œbeat the Market.â€ Some do, but in reality most end up underperforming, which is why Iâ€™m recommending a cheap and easy index fund.
 
You can find these funds at any of the big investment firms: choose from either Fidelity, Vanguard, or Charles Schwab. To use Fidelityâ€™s Total Stock Market Index Fund, FSKAX, thereâ€™s no minimum investment, and the fee is only 0.015%, so every $1,000 you have invested will cost you 15 cents each year. Good practice for investing is to consistently contribute every month, as much as you can afford. You can do things like set up direct deposit to have a portion of your paycheck go straight to your investments, or automatically transfer some amount from your bank like $500 every month, or just contribute each month based on how much you have available. They have good customer service that will help you get setup.  
 
Note on the power of compounding interest: Historically the market has averaged 10% annual returns. At that rate of growth, if you were to invest $1,000/mo for 40 years, you would end up with over 5 million dollars, having contributed a total of $480,000. $500/mo would get you over 2.5 million dollars from $240,000 in total contributions.

Afterthought: Investing is much easier than most think, you just need to find the right fund(s) and contribute monthly, can even set that up automatically. It does get slightly more complex as you get older and as you accumulate more wealth. Once you cross a certain threshold of wealth, and Iâ€™m talking $200,000+ invested, itâ€™d be a good idea to get more diversified. And as you get closer to retirement, youâ€™ll want to invest more conservatively. But both of those are just a matter of adding a couple more funds to your portfolio and choosing how much you want in each one.

kt7mt4,disgruntIed_giraffe,"22M living in California, should I go with Roth or Traditional 401(k)?

There are a few factors to consider and I could use some perspective or opinions on sorting it out. Note that regardless of my 401(k) decision, I plan on opening a Roth IRA and maxing that out annually until retirement.

1. Income: My income is ~$70k and I expect to have a lot more in retirement after 40 years of steady contributions. However because of CA taxes, $70k means Iâ€™m already in the 31.3% tax bracket (22% federal + 9.3% CA). Based on todayâ€™s tax rates, my income would have to be a whole lot higher for my future effective tax rate to be more than 31.3%, especially since Iâ€™ll likely be married. [Higher income in retirement is a pro for Roth, though itâ€™s hard to swallow paying 31.3% today thinking itâ€™d be even more in the future]

2. Location: Living in CA puts me in a very high income tax state, and who knows if Iâ€™ll end up here, or somewhere with lower taxes. It would be nice to stay in CA but anything can happen over these next 40 years. [pro for Traditional since I could only end up in an equal or a lower income tax state]

3. Future tax rates: With relatively low tax rates today and the current state of debt, itâ€™s hard to imagine taxes wonâ€™t be significantly higher 40 years from now. I feel a little risk averse on the fear of doing traditional then getting slammed by taxes in retirement. [pro for Roth because expecting future rates to be higher]

4. Pension: I have a small pension plan at my company. Nothing major but it would definitely serve to raise my retirement income. But unless I stay at this company this point is not applicable. [pro for Roth because higher retirement income if I stay with company]

5. Roth reliability: I think itâ€™s less likely but worth noting the possibility of the government finding ways to tax Roth in the future, whether itâ€™s wealth tax, sales tax, or just diminished Roth benefits. [pro for Traditional]",No,No,No,No,No
mm42vv,disgruntIed_giraffe,"Looking to buy an apartment for my twenties, then eventually upgrade to a house. Rather than selling the apartment for cash for the next down payment, would it be ideal if feasible to keep apartment as a rental property?

I know a lot goes into that question in terms of the investment value of the specific property, but Iâ€™m just looking for insight on this strategy as a way to broaden my portfolio. If I can save up for the second down payment without needing to sell the apartment, and if I can find renters that will cover the apartmentâ€™s mortgage after moving out, then Iâ€™ll eventually come out owning the apartment and can earn rental income or cash out if needed. My primary and only source of investing right now is saving 15-20% of my income via IRA and 401k, and Iâ€™ll continue to do that until I retire. Iâ€™m thinking anything above that 15-20% could go toward maintaining this property, rather than toward increasing retirement contributions. 

I know I need to be prepared to handle both my apartment mortgage and home mortgage in times when renters fall out, plus plenty of maintenance costs to consider. But assuming Iâ€™m in a good enough financial position to handle those (steady income, big emergency fund), should I make it a goal to pursue this option? If so then when I do buy the apartment that Iâ€™ll live in, Iâ€™ll also have to consider its investment potential rather than just is it a good/affordable place to live.

I like this option because it would increase my portfolio beyond just my 401k and IRA, and I see this as the only way Iâ€™d be able to get into real estate investing, as I donâ€™t want to outright buy a rental property, but soon Iâ€™ll have to buy a place to live, so after a few years I will have some equity in it and be able to make a more informed decision on keeping that property as an investment.",Yes,Yes,No,No,No
nadmbs,disgruntIed_giraffe,"To pay off or not to pay off debt...

Looking for some friendly â€œWhat Would You Doâ€™sâ€ in my situation. 

I (23M) have close to $30k in student loan debt and am otherwise debt free. The average interest rate is 4.5% with loans ranging from 4 to 5.5%. I have a full emergency fund, save approximately 15-20% of my paycheck in retirement accounts, and save about ~$2k a month in cash that I have not yet determined how to use. The excess cash could go toward: 
* Paying off debt quickly
* Saving for a downpayment on a home (not urgent but I want to be ready to do this in the next few years)
* Increasing retirement contributions

Thinking my main two options are as follows:
1. Put that $2k/mo entirely toward student loans, have them paid off by summer of 2022, then start saving for a house while seeing if thereâ€™s extra room in the budget to increase retirement contributions
2. Make the minimum monthly payments over the life of the loan while prioritizing increasing retirement contributions and start saving for a down payment when necessary. 

The emotional component is in favor of option #1 as I think it would feel great to not have to worry about debt anymore, but I know the loan interest isnâ€™t that high especially since Iâ€™m young, so looking strictly at the math Iâ€™m likely better off investing (though I do think this might be slightly offset by the seemingly increased risk of market uncertainty at this time).

Background - Iâ€™m 24 with an 80K income in a HCOL area. Iâ€™m contributing 20% of my income toward retirement between a Roth IRA and Roth 401K (might switch to traditional 401K in the coming years but doing Roth for now), which equates to 6K to the IRA and 10K to the 401K, so I still have 9.5K of unused Roth 401K contributions. I donâ€™t want to increase retirement contributions beyond 20% because I feel thatâ€™s a good baseline and that I should prioritize saving for the likelihood of needing a downpayment on a home in the next 5-10 years.

Question - Since my timeline for a downpayment is 5-10 years, I figure I should be investing that money rather than holding it all in cash. Rather than using a taxable brokerage account, would it make sense to save for a down payment via increasing my Roth 401k contributions, with the intention of withdrawing that money in 5-10 years, since thereâ€™s a penalty free early withdrawal exception for first-time homebuyers? If that exception includes the non taxable Roth growth (correct me if it doesnâ€™t), then essentially I can invest without capital gains tax up until reaching my Roth 401K limit, and the downside of not being able to withdraw until age 59.5 is eliminated since this falls under one of the early withdraw exceptions.

rfk1yb,disgruntIed_giraffe,"Does high inflation incentivize holding onto debt?

I have 30K student loan debt with 4.5% interest, and Iâ€™ve always used that 4.5% number as the basis for my internal pay off debt v invest argument, i.e. pay off debt for the security of being debt free and receive a guaranteed 4.5% rate of return, or invest hoping for better returns. 

Now with inflation on the rise, it devalues the amount of debt I have and offsets the interest I owe. Iâ€™m salaried and receive annual inflation-based raises, so letâ€™s assume next year I get a 4.5% inflation raise applied to my salary, that would loosely translate to my loan being interest free in terms of real dollars right?

So now the debate becomes pay off debt for the security of being debt free or invest hoping for better returns, except now the returns just have to beat inflation or it to be net positive. Does my logic here make sense?

Edit: after reading comments I think I can more accurately summarize my viewpoints
* Inflation offsets interest on debt in terms of real dollars
* Assuming 4.5% inflation, the real value of my debt remains the same, but the nominal dollars increases which still affects me, but THIS is offset if I get the 4.5% inflation raise
* Due to the above two points, in the debate of Debt v Investing: interest rate on my debt is no longer a factor in the equation, and if I choose investing, I just need to outpace inflation for a net positive.",Yes,Yes,No,No,No

I know Iâ€™m splitting hairs here, but it helps me with tracking and goal setting.

Hypothetical $100k gross salary and 75k net salary. Annual savings is 10k pre-tax to 401k and 6k after-tax to Roth IRA. So what is my savings rate?

* 10k pre-tax / 100k gross income = 10% savings rate
* 6k Roth / 75k net income = 8% savings rate

I'd like to be able to plan for this recurring monthly expense. Unfortunately, I have no idea where the loan paperwork is - my mom has passed away, I live 1000 miles from my parents' home, and haven't been able to find the paperwork when I visit.

Seems easy, right? So I secure messaged the credit union for more information about the loan (loan term, or payment, or minimum payment, literally anything). They said to call.

So call I did. They said sorry, I'm unable to see that information. I asked to escalate the call to ""loan services"". They said the same thing, and told me that I will receive a letter in the mail one month before payments begin with this information, but that they cannot tell me now what my payments will be.

Recently I was in my hometown, so stopped into a local branch to figure all of this out. I started with a woman at the information desk, who referred me to a loan specialist. She went through my loan information on the computer and told me everything that I already knew (loan rate 8.5%, date I took out the loan, current student status, date payments will begin) but STILL could not see my expected payment or loan term. I asked to talk to the person above her, who was not in (either day I tried).

Honestly this is just ridiculous, is there no way to get this information? I've used this credit union for decades, I do not see what the problem is.",No,Yes,Yes,No,Yes
14hy0w5,DishsoapOnASponge,"Any considerations for buying a house with a parent in ~5 years?

I live in an HCOL area. My dad lives 1000 miles away in the Midwest and has expressed interest in moving out here if only the cost of living weren't so ridiculous, as my family (sister, BIL, nephew) live nearby as well.
 
I'm kicking around the possibility of us together buying both halves of a two-family home. The cost I've seen is about 650-700k for two units with one bedroom each. Right now I make about 130k, and my dad (retired) has a home worth about $200k.  After moving, I do not want him to have any sort of recurring payments.

In 5 years, I anticipate having about 100k saved, and my dad will have 200k from his current house. The logistics of ""whose name is the duplex in"" and ""who pays the down payment"" aren't important right now, my question is as follows...

...I don't see many people doing this, but it seems like a no-brainer. Parent gets to downsize, kid gets to own a house in an expensive area and know their neighbor. There are plenty of duplexes on Zillow where both halves are for sale. What's the catch? Is there anything I'm not thinking about?

I know it seems premature but if it seems like a valid decision I want to bring it up to my dad ASAP - emotionally, working toward a move like that (from a city he's lived in his entire life) will likely take longer than it will for me to save up ;)

Thanks!

My field (physics) has plenty of good jobs without going to graduate school, but for the positions I'd like, a PhD is required. I rationalized this by thinking that 35-year-old me will be happier than a 35-year-old with the same BS who didn't go to grad school, because of more job flexibility. And losing 8 years of a good salary isn't the end of the world, right?

uou1ec,DishsoapOnASponge,"Options to tide myself over until graduation?

Hey guys,

I'm in a rough financial predicament right now. I'm a 28-year-old graduate student making $35k/yr, in my last year. In &lt;6 months, I will graduate with my PhD (physics, from an Ivy) and will make approximately 100k. I do not yet have an offer, but I have enough connections in industry that for all intents and purposes, this is guaranteed.

However, my rent just went up by $500/month. When I moved in seven years ago, I paid $1000/month, it went up to $1500/month over the past seven years, and is now $2000. 

My plan was to graduate this May, in which case I would not have had to sign a new lease. However, as my mom passed away and I had to take time off to play home hospice nurse for a few months, I am now graduating in the fall.

As a result, I am chewing through my savings. I will also need to move after I graduate, as I live in the middle of nowhere and my PhD focus is very niche. I am planning on taking out an unsecured personal loan out for first+last+security when I move, as most jobs are in the Boston area where first+last+security will run 8k easily.

My assets/debts are as follows:

* Undergrad student loans: $20k (payment not required until after graduation)
* Monthly expenses: $730
* Vehicles: Both owned outright, car worth $2k motorcycle worth $500
* Emergency fund: $1k
* Investment accounts: $4k
* Roth IRA: $4k


I paid off about $10k of student loans while in grad school, despite not being required to pay, just because I hated seeing the interest rack up. I also put a measly amount of money into an IRA, both of which were kind of stupid as I chewed through my savings so quickly once my rent went up.

Honestly, I am so stressed right now. My rent is $2k per month now, and I get paid $2.4k monthly. I cannot move without paying a $2k fine to cut the lease, and even if I could, finding somewhere that will take two cats is difficult, and I will pay another $1-2k just for a security deposit. I have taken up a part-time job for 5h/week, the maximum I'm allowed to work as a FT grad student.

I just need to last six more months. Maybe less. What can I do? Do I really just sit back and watch my savings dwindle?

voeetu,DishsoapOnASponge,"Sell my car now, later, or keep and repair?

I have a 2007 Camry with 180k miles on it. It's worth about 3k. I just dumped 3k into it (over several months) to repair some things - catalytic converter, transmission repair, new brakes. 

In six months, I'll wrap up grad school and move to another state with inspections. I recently took my car to a mechanic in that state and while there for repairs, got a quote for bringing the car up to speed to pass inspection. The e-brake and ABS do not work in my car and a few emissions issues, altogether about $3k for it to pass inspection.

My problem is this. I'm in my last semester of grad school (PhD) and my rent just went up by over 30%. I don't have the cash on hand if I have another major car repair. I will have no issue getting a job, and also have an offer for one which I consider a backup job. 

My options are as follows:

1. Sell my car now, use the money to make monthly payments to buy or lease a car, put $0 down. 
2. Risk another car repair, which will either put me underwater or leave me car-less. Sell and buy a car in ~6 mo when I move and need to have the car inspected.

yzhj44,DishsoapOnASponge,"I am having issues obtaining a personal loan and am not understanding why, can someone help?

I am 29, and in my last year of a reputable PhD program in physics. I have a stipend, but it's not much (high 20s, and I pay 1.3k/mo in rent...). I also have student loans from undergrad, about 30k. Really just pinching pennies here trying to make it to graduation.

I have had credit cards since I was 18. I pay them off each month, and have never missed a payment. My credit score is in the upper 700s. 

Recently, I received a job offer in a major metropolitan area. It pays about 6x what I currently make. I need to move, but cannot afford to. Relocation assistance is not offered through this position.

I went to my credit union where I have been a customer since age 12 (with a kiddo account). I asked for a personal loan for moving expenses and first/last month's rent in my new place (totals about 10k). I showed them my job offer, and detailed what I would spend the money on. I made clear my history with the credit union (I keep my savings there, and use the checking account regularly). 

I was denied, on the basis that I was asking for a 10k loan on technically a salary less than 30k. Makes sense.

I simply do not know how to move forward - if my own credit union will not loan me this money, I do not know who will without charging exorbitant interest rates. 

Is my current income truly the only consideration when making decisions about personal loans? This is quite ridiculous. I cannot stay in my current area as there are no jobs here - are highly employable graduate students really expected to take a less-than-desirable job in a LCOL area just because they cannot afford to move?

I do not have friends or family to loan me money, as even with my measly grad student stipend I make more than my parents lol.

EDIT: Some have suggested an extended stay hotel, but I have two cats, one of which is special needs. I do not have family that I trust to take care of them (a previous cat was once put down without permission by my only family with the space) and my friends do not have the space/willingness as they are mostly grad students too. I know I am being picky but I will not give them up or have them somewhere where their health will suffer.

zyhogm,DishsoapOnASponge,"Salary increasing by 300% but also moving to HCOL... wondering if I'm missing anything in my budget.

Hey there!

I am a PhD student (F29) making 40k gross right now, with $1600 monthly rent/utilities expenses. I also spend about $1k/mo for everything else.

I just got a job at a startup in an HCOL area (Boston, MA). There are a lot of things I've never had to worry about before (student loans, retirement plans, health insurance) and I'd love a second (third, fourth... thousandth...) set of eyes.

My gross income will be 130k. From online calculators, it seems like I will lose about 34k to taxes so 96k net, a nice round $8k/mo take home pay.

**8k take home**

From this, I will take $6k and put into a separate account so that I will never see it. I will pay:

**$500 - student loans** I have about $28k (before any forgiveness) at 4%. I think making the minimum payments here makes sense, as I earn more in the market.

**$500 - Roth IRA** I have a target date fund through Schwab. This will max out my Roth IRA contributions for the year as I understand. Since my job is at a startup, there are no retirement plans or anything.

**$500 - HDHP premium and HSA contribution**. I don't know exactly what health plans are offered by my employer as I don't start formally until February, but if it's an option I'd prefer an HDHP with an HSA. If I can, I'll put $300/mo away in the HSA to max it out. Otherwise this will just be my premium. I'm a healthy single person so don't have much need for a low-deductible plan.

**$3500 - rent/utilities** No way to get around this one, I'm afraid. I've signed the lease and set up utilities. Might go down in the future but not planning on it right now.

**$150 - car/renters insurance combo** 

**$850 - non-tax-advantaged investment account** This will be my emergency fund. I rent and won't need a car for commuting, so I'm okay with this being in the market. Also will help with a car downpayment in the future, or a house downpayment in the far far far far future. At first, this will actually go toward paying off a loan I took out to move - I get a signing bonus which covered a lot, but not everything...

That is the 6k that I won't ever look at. I will then have 2k for spending money:

**$300 - savings account** For things like vacations, gifts, random shit.

**$800 - groceries/restaurant** This is about 20% above what I spend now when I'm lazy about budgeting, allowing a bit of lifestyle inflation (and HCOL inflation...)

**$200 - clothing** I know this sounds ridiculous. My clothes are falling apart, and as a grad student lab rat I've spent most of my days in comfy informal clothing.

**$700 - misc** Vet bills. Cat food. Vehicle fuel. Random shit. Honestly I find that everything that isn't food totally racks up without even thinking about it.

I really need to get my own vehicle soon, but for now am borrowing a relative's. I pay them, but would like to be independent. I have a good amount of cash saved up to buy my own SUV. Looking mostly at used Toyota Rav4's or Subaru Forrester's (but willing to consider any comparable SUV that has a good reputation and is on the cheaper end - Toyotas, Hondas, Hyundais, etc.). 

Where things get complicated....I think...

1. Market seems not great now for buying used cars. Prices seem high from what I've heard

2. This would be my first vehicle I bought on my own (ie without parents)

3. Interest rates are high (not a problem if I use cash, but I also wonder if saving cash and investing it would benefit me more - maybe not worth the risk if its 5% +)

4. I could technically use my relative's car longer, but then they (potentially) lose out on the opportunity cost of selling their car sooner

5. I am also looking for a house to buy asap as well

6. I can also buy the vehicle under a family/my LLC I think

7. If I do a loan, would it make sense in today's market? And how does one go about finding a good loan or dealership that offers rebates (just learned this is sometimes a thing)?

Also, I know it can get tricky year over year with how much of the gains are on money you put in vs gains/ especially if you do DCAâ€¦does a form come in yrly that explains those gains that you can use on your form or is it up to you to determine what is taxed?

17udmz4,DoeJumars,"Why do so many not account for SS?

Doesn't it seem silly to think SS won't be there and not at least expect \~20k a person (todays dollars) in SS, when you see/hear how many people >60 have next to nothing saved for retirement? It just seems odd so many people say to act like you'll get nothing, but those same people say ""oh of the market doesn't go up in a few decades > now, then we have bigger things to worry about"", isn't that the same case with SS being gone?_x000D_  
_x000D_  
Reason I ask is when I see ""1m in today's dollars isn't enough to retire""...to me, at least, thinking about having 1m in retirement for my wife and I and having a paid off house, seems fine. If I retire at 65 with 1m in 401k and start taking out my SS + wifes (estimates in todays dollars) of \~55k a year there + SWR of even 35k to be safe...that gives us 90k a year to take out with low taxable income and no FICA taxes leaves us with over 80k to spend, we don't even spend that now!_x000D_  
_x000D_  
So if you trust the market will continue to progress forward, why wouldn't you trust SS will, when so many depend on it and have paid into it?

I know a Roth IRA should be used for retirement, get that. I know people use taxable account for different reasons, get that. 

What I am wondering, though, is if someone has a healthy 401k from work and has an extra 7k a year to save why would they put it in a taxable brokerage account before putting in a Roth IRA? 

The way I see it is if I am 30 and do 7k a year to a Roth at 45 I have 105k of TAX FREE contributions I could take out of my Roth IRA at any point vs had it been in a brokerage paying 15% on that money. I know the other (gains) on the Roth cannot be taken out so perhaps thatâ€™s the situation itâ€™s better but I would imagine for a lot of people the Ira is a better option especially those with a more traditional life whoâ€™s kids start going to college/get married when the parent is 50â€¦you could have close to 300k between you and your spouse of money you could pull out for things like that and pay 0 tax on it vs paying if you had to take it out of a taxable brokerage assuming youâ€™re still working and making a good salary. Just wondering if Iâ€™m missing something because I feel like I never see this talked about.

* **900k** (445 in mine, 445 in my wifes- who I contribute to via the spousal Roth since she doesn't work)  **Roth IRA (100% SP 500)**
* **250k in HSA (100% SP 500**

*...kid(s) are in college/finishing up, I have a 529 setup for them which should cover costs or at least a good chunk of them, so assume they're good there.*

*My wife and I can live off 65k a year. House paid off, if anything we could downsize. This lets us live life, enjoy some vaca's, etc.*

**My question is, what order should I do things? In my mind:**

1. Take out \~85k in IRA money a year which after taxes gives me that 65k I need to live life from age 60-70 or as long as I can (*put off SS until 70*).
2. I have \~25k left that I can roll over from my IRA to Roth and pay minimal taxes on to fill the 12% bracket (MFJ) and let that grow tax free for later via a conversion/ladder whatever you want to call it, Repeat step 1-2 as long as I can until the well runs dry. *All the while my Roth IRA and HSA keep growing, I use the HSA to pay any big medical expense but hoping they wont be that crazy.*
3. My IRA gets milked dry eventually because I am taking out close to 6% a year plus the \~25k I am rolling over which is basically 8%, twice the recommended amount...but instead of doing me 30 years it will do me \~15 which is probably more than I really need since SS is about to hit at 70 for wife and I. 
4. Now I am 70, have put off SS long enough. I don't have much left in the IRA so I can use that to fill lower tax brackets, wife and I are combined supposed to get 59k a year in SS by now which probably will only be taxed at 50% because I am using only \~30k in IRA a year to fill the lower brackets. I still roll over the excess like I have been until I am finally dry of IRA.
5. Now I have no IRA but my Roths have been growing forever, same with HSA and we get a lot of SS. Rest of my life I can pull out anything in Roth tax free, use SS to fill lower tax brackets, HSA for health still...

1. Can I open a SEP IRA to do this? If so what are the limits assuming I max out my 401k and Roth already?

2. I have read you have to pay quarterly taxes to IRS when you are 1099 (annoying), can I just withhold more taxes from my w2 job so they are getting more every check off me and will be off my back about any penalties come tax filing season?

3. Iâ€™ve always taken standard deduction because my w2 was cut and dry, seeing as Iâ€™m part 1099 now can I write off expenses while taking that standard deduction still or do I have to rework everything and itemize all my stuffâ€¦just wondering if itâ€™s worth it and if Iâ€™ll have more than 25k to write off. 

4. Am I right to (simplified) assume that if I make 100k (married file jointly, wife doesnâ€™t work) in my w2 and I make 40k 1099 that my income is 140k, less the standard deduction,  less any 401k, HSA, SEP Ira plus paying double FICA tax on that 40k (or the portion of it thatâ€™s not deductible or whatever)?

Any feedback or answers are welcome!",Yes,Yes,No,Yes,No
ti814k,DoeJumars,"The age old, Roth vs Traditional debate..

Iâ€™m 34, MFJ. I just got a second freelance gig for ~45k a year and I make 105k at my main job so ~150k total for wife and I. 

If I max my traditional 401k, HSA and take advantage of some of the self employment tax advantages I can probably get under the 22% tax bracket.


*my job does NOT match our 401k


I am comfortable right now, my house is paid off (wife and I made money and paid aggressive when we were in mid 20s). LCOL area.

I have 165k in traditional 401k now, have Roth IRAs for us both with 12k in each and just started maxing our HSA.

My question though is (I know I should keep going in on traditional to save that 10% on federal taxes) but man I love the idea of paying a bit more on taxes right now when Iâ€™m comfortable and know I can afford to than in retirement when I donâ€™t know what brackets are going to be, donâ€™t want RMDs, want to retire in my late 50s..

Someone talk me off the ledge, am I crazy or do you agree? If I never put another dollar into traditional with 6% gains Iâ€™d be over 700k in my taxable accounts which I could use 60-70 to fill low tax brackets and rest I can take out of Roths, then after 70 Iâ€™ll have a fat SS (Iâ€™m not one who thinks itâ€™s going away, people will starve to death) and if not that Iâ€™ll have Roth and HSA too. I also think the fact with Roth being able to have low bracket if you retire before 65 is huge with ACA premiums tooâ€¦am I nuts?",Yes,Yes,No,No,No

I'm stuck in an apartment building I've lived in for roughly 3 years and I'm tired of being here. I've been a waiter (primarily) since I was 16 and I want to do something new. Also my degree will be in business management.

My plan: 
My lease ends in 2023 (yeah I jumped the gun a few months back and renewed my lease for $50 more a month, making it $1090 a month starting in June) but by then I hope to have a new job. I'm applying for a tsa job but I'm stuck in the background check portion. 

If that doesn't work out I'm going to email my old internship manager (they offered me a spot back but I had just taken a sales job and had to decline out of respect for the new employer). I figured I should email her if and only if I fail the background check because if I ask her too soon then get the position it'll look unprofessional. 

If that attempt doesn't work then I'll move back to Massachusetts because sister in law said she could help me get a good security job. After that I've got no real plan (but considering that's a plan c and potentially 2 years out I don't think it's smart to plan much farther).

In the meantime I'm going to start trying to save $250 to $500 a month from now until June, 2023. I say try because during the winter our restaurant is SLOW, like $60 a weekday slow and maybe $100 on a weekend.

Hi Reddit, 

Kind of an unusual post, but seriously looking for some insight. I'm a 27M and make roughly $112k/yr in medium to high COL area. Current savings are roughly $135k in investment/retirement accounts and $20k HYSA. I max 401k, HSA, Roth IRA, and also have an ESPP. Even after all that, I usually end up with around $1-1.5k to put into HYSA after monthly spending. In total, I end up saving around 45-50% net. I don't explicitly try to save that much (particularly all the extra going into HYSA), but I also don't really know what to spend it on. I build a 'fun budget' into my monthly expenses, but I never end up using it. No plans to FIRE, I don't go out very often, and feel like I already splurge on the few things I do want. I also don't have any specific goals for my savings - car is relatively new, live with GF that owns her place.

* $23k federal student loans @ 4.5% weighted average interest, standard repayment plan (can't find remaining length but \~8yrs remaining)
* MS/BS in biomedical engineering, working as a test engineer in medical devices (stable income that will only increase)
* I want to prioritize maxing my Roth 401k and Roth IRA annually before paying loans
* SoFi estimated 2.5% APR w/ $400/mo payment over 5 years if I wanted to refinance

My questions are:

1. If I refinanced, would I be able to pay over the $400/mo or am I stuck paying that rate? Ideally I want to lock in a lower interest rate and then pay more than required so I can burn through my loan faster while accruing less interest. However, I'm still limited by wanting to prioritize retirement funds. 
2. Is it worth refinancing if I throw $800-1k/mo into my loans at my current 4.5%? I could probably throw in upwards of $1.5 - 2k/mo and be done within a year, but at the cost of lowering my retirement contributions.",No,Yes,No,No,No

gr8jvo,Droid2Win,"Looking for saving/investing advice

Alright, so the market is super volatile right now, so I'm not sure how great any additional investing options will be. The quick summary is I'm in very good financial shape, and very grateful for it. I'm just looking for advice on how to do even better.

Alright, here are the numbers:

\- I make 96k/yr in a medium COL area.

\- I contribute 12% of my salary to my 401k, plus an employer match of 5%. So I'm contributing a hell of a lot into that already. I have $22k in it currently, the combined contribution each bi-weekly paycheck is $633, and I'm 31 years old, so I feel like I'm in good shape here.

\- I bought a house last year. $200k, new construction, put 20% down so no PMI. Making all my payments on time, plus extra principle payments each month. \~$160k in mortgage debt from this. 3.875% interest rate.

\- Only other debt is my car payment. It's $365/month, the interest rate is 3.5%. I have about $12k left, I'm not in any huge rush to dump money into paying it off given how low the interest rate is.

\- I have an Ally bank savings account. It used to have a much higher interest rate, but that rate has fallen (obviously) to 1.25%. Still higher than a lot of other places, but it's less than half of what it was a year ago. I have $52k in my savings.

Like I said, I'm in good shape. With my Ally account being at a lower interest rate, I'm wondering what options I have to grow my money. Ally offers CDs but only at 1.3%, which isn't worth it at all IMO.

I could move my checking account from Chase to Ally and get the 0.1% interest on that. I keep a few thousand in my checking account for bill pay and whatnot, so getting anything at all on that would be cool. But again, that's nothing.

So, do I have any obvious options to strengthen my financial position even more? I'm already putting a lot of money in for retirement, but are there any other decent investing/saving strategies beyond that?

Edit: Ok, so here is an update after the first wave of responses.

\- This morning I bumped my 401k contribution rate to 20%. My math is a little off on this because I haven't fully factored in and pro-rated my earlier contributions at the lower rate, but roughly I feel this will let me get close to the max for this year. I'll do more precise calculations in the near future, that's something I'm better at. I know that for a full calendar year though 20% puts me right at the edge of the max.

\- I'm looking into IRAs. I want to at least take advantage of the fact that I can contribute $12k this year. I would probably do $6k right away to take advantage of the 2019 extension, and then gradually do the other $6k over the rest of this year to take advantage of spreading the contributions across the market at different times.

Not sure if I'm going to do this heavy contributions to an IRA every single year in the future (although I crunched the numbers and it is appealing), but I want to at least get it started here.

New question: how do I setup an IRA? I have my company 401k account with Prudential, but I would want to setup the IRA, not sure if I should do it with them. I would target index funds for a safer investment in this area.",Yes,Yes,No,Yes,No

What I would like to build on top of that is get a Roth IRA (I know I can put 6k now for 2019 and then add more over the course of this year for another 6k). Also I would be interested in a brokerage account and maybe doing some general trading. That one I'm a little more uncertain about but I'm actively studying investing and when I study something I tend to get very, very good at it.

So I just opened a Roth IRA with TD Ameritrade. I only put in $100 to start with, I plan to fund it with the full $6,000 for 2019 but I'm new at this so I wanted to dip my toes in with a small amount while figuring it out.

Anyway, I bought one share of the SPY ETF for \~$80 (waiting for the market to open for the purchase to go through with a final price). That leaves me with \~$20 leftover right now.

So in the long run, I'll add more money and buy more shares of index funds and stuff like that, so the specific \~$20 amount leftover isn't the point. It's the general concept of that my share purchases will almost certainly not perfectly line up with the amount of money that I fund the account with.

TD Ameritrade doesn't offer fractional share purchases. So what is the recommended approach? I could find something cheaper to put the cash into, or I guess just let it sit there for a bit. My plan is to put in the $6,000 for 2019 fairly soon, then start making weekly contributions towards the 2020 amount. So if I left the leftover cash alone, it could be combined with that. Maybe that's the best/simplest answer.

h10h4r,Droid2Win,"Trying to understand the financial data to evaluate a fund. Total investing noob.

So I'm beginning to try investing in index funds. I opened a Roth IRA with TD Ameritrade, and I've been researching funds there. There are a LOT of stats there, which I love because I'm a numbers/data kind of guy. I just don't have the level of knowledge to properly evaluate what those numbers mean.

First, the past returns. For all these numbers, I'm referring to SPYG. There are two charts, Trailing Total Returns and Standardized Returns. Their numbers are virtually identical, so I'm not stressing distinguishing between them yet.

So the 5 year Market Return % here  says 13.12%. What I'm wondering is if this is annualized or supposed to be a total? I ask this because it conflicts with the next piece of data I'm seeing.

Anyway, they have this performance chart. It shows the hypothetical growth of $10k over the past 5 years. It shows that $10k growing to just over $18k today. By my math, that's an over 80% growth over the past 5 years.

I'm just trying to understand the difference here. Is the Market Return % annualized/average, or is there some other piece of math going on here. Thank you.

Alright, so I'm somewhat new to investing. Like so many during the pandemic, I've been taking account of my finances and thinking of ways to do better with it.

I have a good stable job that pays me very, very well, I own a house (well, a mortgage, but still), I have no other debt, and a LOT of cash in the bank because I'm generally very good at saving money.

So, after some conversations here, I made a few changes. First, I started maxing out my 401k. By the end of this year I'll have put in the legal maximum amount to it. Then I opened a Roth IRA and put in $6,000 for the 2019 contribution. I'm slowing moving that $6k into index funds, I did a lot of research and picked a diverse group of them that I like, and I'm trying to DCA mostly because in my non-expert opinion I expect this year's volatility to offer some cool opportunities to grab shares at lower prices so I don't want to throw it all in right away.

On top of that I opened a Robinhood account, and I've been putting some additional money into there, almost $1,000. Still investing in those same index funds there.

I'm wondering if the Robinhood account is the right away to go, especially since I'm investing in index funds. Those will have good rates of return (or so I've read), but only over the long term. I'm 31 right now, so maybe it would be better to stop investing in Robinhood and instead put all my investing money into the Roth IRA.

I know it's free if all I have to do is file federal. I live in Florida with no state taxes so that should be all I need. The catch is that I have other income streams.

Anyway my mortgage servicer sent me spam about a promotion they're doing with quicken loans for refinancing. I figured I'd give them a call and hear some numbers associated with it. I expected to be underwhelmed and turn it down but the opposite is true. They're offering me a reduction to 2.875% and estimated closing costs are only $4,200.

luwd7o,Droid2Win,"Wondering if I'm overthinking my index fund selection

So after reading the wiki on this subreddit last year I started investing in index funds. It fits my goals, stable mostly reliable growth of my money over time. I started out doing a bunch of research into different funds and picking a variety to split my money between. Lately though I've been realizing that was pointless and needlessly complicated, given that most of them were just some form of s&amp;p index with different weights.

So instead, I have a new plan to shift my investments too. Yet I'm still sitting here wondering if it is still being over thought. Feedback appreciated.

Also, I haven't settled on an exact formula for splitting funds between them all, was going to start with them all pretty much equal shares of total investment.

VOO - s&amp;p 500 index fund. Nice and simple and reliable.

VB - CRSPR small cap index fund. Opposite of the large cap stocks in the s&amp;p.

VTI - total us stock index. Might be overkill if I'm doing VOO and VB already, but figure there will be some stuff in here that's not in those two.

SPYG - s&amp;p 500 growth stocks. this is leftover from my original over thought index fund plan. I'm reluctant to move on from this one because of how it has the highest historical growth rate of all the funds I'm investing in. I know past performance doesn't equal future growth though. Also it's shares are cheap and it's an easy thing to throw leftover cash after grabbing the other ones into a share of this.

m3gw2o,Droid2Win,"Just got my first employee stock grant - questions

So I just got a grant of company stock as part of my compensation package for the first time in my life. It vests over 3 years, so I don't get access to it immediately. Never gotten something like this before, and I'm sitting here reading the docs they gave me with it trying to wrap my head around things. Here are my questions so far:

1) I have 3 vesting dates over the next 3 years. I'm supposed to get 1/3 of the value each date. Does that mean I would get all the shares, but only able to be sold at 1/3 price at that time, or 1/3 of the shares at full price? **UPDATE:** I can answer this one myself, at the end of the documentation there's a table that specifies how many shares I get on which date.

2) It says that once the shares vest, I'm liable for any taxes I might owe. I live in the USA. Would I owe taxes on the stocks right away, or would I only owe taxes when I sell them? I would think it would only be at sale, and whatever tax rate I'm subject to would apply to the whole value of the sale, because the entire thing is basically profit.

3) Dividends. This seems straightforward. Sounds like the dividends will be held by the company, and I will receive whatever proceeds come from them on the same vesting schedule as everything else. Also, as I get the stocks vested, I'll get dividends directly.

4) Could the company restrict my ability to sell shares after vesting? There's a confusing paragraph in their legal document about this. While it's a big and successful company, they're also so big that I don't feel they have a ton of stock growth opportunities. You know, a company that dominates an industry, but is already there so limited further growth room. Anyway, the stock has been flat (up and down, staying the same basic level) for 3 years now. So honestly, I would probably sell the shares and put the proceeds into my usual index funds if I had the choice, so restrictions on sale matter to me.

Thanks as always.",Yes,Yes,No,Yes,No

I bought my first house at the end of 2019. Its a 3BR townhome in a good location with very high housing demand. Now im going to consider doing anything for at least the next few years, but I still feel like asking this here. Basically I always figured this would be my starter home and then one day I could go out and buy a nicer one and sell this one. However, the idea of renting instead of selling has been brought up several times as a future idea, so I figured I would ask here.

I've done some basic research into some of the numbers involved. I found similar homes to determine current rental prices, and even if I pay ~$200/month for property management, I would still take home an extra ~$400/month, plus the equity I'm getting from continuing to pay that mortgage. There seems to be a decent amount of upside to the idea, and I can always sell in the future if I need to.

So I started investing in 2020 like many others. I maxed out my 401k and Roth IRA and then I was using Robinhood.

Anyway, turns out they were just late, but even after getting the form I figured whatever, it's barely anything I'm leaving out. And that's pretty true, I got like $35 in dividends and $1.34 in taxable gains on a stock sale (didn't sell very much, just buy and hold index funds).

q6qa1m,Droid2Win,"Putting part of emergency fund in I-Bonds, good idea?

So I'm fortunate to be in a position where I'm maxing out a Roth IRA, traditional 401k, and have done some taxable brokerage investing too. I have a low risk tolerance, everything is in index funds. I also have 40k in an emergency fund. I know that is higher than this sub usually recommends, but for me the opportunity cost is worth it for the peace of mind I get from those reserves.

That being said, I'm looking for better options that my HYSA. I use Ally, I know I've got one of the best savings rates out there, but at the moment that's just 0.5%. I've been reading about I-Bonds, and how they are a good hedge against inflation. Basically a way to preserve the value of my emergency fund.

I wouldn't put all of it into I-Bonds, but I feel up to half would be a good move. I would protect it's value from inflation, and after 1 year I can redeem the bonds whenever I want, I just sacrifice some of the interest.

qf35q5,Droid2Win,"What is a good class or similar thing to learn how to evaluate companies for investing?

Hi. So I'm in a very good financial position, and that included investing. While I didn't take investing seriously in my 20s, my early 30s have had me take a huge interest in it. 401k, Roth IRA, brokerage, I'm doing all of it. I'm very confident in the choices I've made so far, since it's been a very simple one: total stock market index fund. With a long time horizon for my investing goals, this is a nice, safe option.

In the meantime I've been studying investing in general. The thing is, the more I know, the more indecisive I become. I stick with the index fund because it's safe, but I do want to make some more direct investments. To be able to pick a company and invest in that stock with a reasonable expectation of a high return from them. I mean, I could totally be wrong, and at times likely will be. And this will not be my entire investing strategy, only a small portion of it, so I view the risks there as low.

When I started down this road, I downloaded a bunch of 10Qs and started reading them. At that point, my brain melted.

So, after this long, far too long post, I'm just hoping someone can direct me to a good source that can teach me how to better ingest and understand this data so I can make informed decisions.

I'm about to start working at a startup on its Series A round of funding. I'm receiving RSUs which will vest over a period of 5 years as a part of my compensation. I know it's RSUs, that's what it said in the offer letter. I'm a little lost in terms of the overall financial/tax implications here. I could definitely ask my new employer, and I probably should, but I like looking these things up on my own.

Anyway, since the company is private I don't think the shares I am getting truly have any value. From my own research, the way I think it's working is the shares vest both over a 4-year period (25% vesting each year), but they also require a ""triggering event"" like an IPO before they become something I can cash in on. If I'm right, then what happens in terms of taxes. For example, one year from now I would get 25% of the shares ""vested"", even though I can't cash them in yet because the company will almost definitely still be private. Would I owe taxes then? Or would I only owe taxes upon the ""triggering event"" (ie, IPO, etc)?

138rys7,Ecstatic_Tiger_2534,"The 28% rule â€“ possible to be in a position to bend the rule a bit?

I'm 31, living in VHCOL city, still renting. I want to buy and have the funds together for a purchase, but the rise in interest rates this past year have put affordability just outside of reach according to the 28% rule, on which I have based my budget.

I am generally risk-averse, but wonder if I just need to become more aggressive to get in and get ahead. It feels like I've been playing leapfrog for years, reaching previous thresholds to become a buyer and then painfully watching market affordability leap back out of reach. I'm still early enough into a strong career trajectory that if I can just break the cycle and make a purchase happen, it *should* become easier to afford over time.

**Here's the specific question:** with a rule of thumb like the 28% rule intended to apply to a wide range of people and situations, how do you know when you're in a position to bend it a bit?

Specifically:

* **I have no other debt.** Student loan and car are paid off, and I never carry CC debt as a rule.
* **I have no dependents.** And have no plans to any time soon, if ever. That's a sizable expense in many people's budgets that isn't a factor in mind.
* **Retirement is solidly on track.** I currently have $150k in retirement funds, which I would not need to touch at all for a home purchase. I max out my 401k and Roth IRA each year and plan to continue doing so, but would have reducing contributions temporarily as a lever to pull if I ever need to divert some cash flow.
* **I'll have a healthy cash buffer**. Even after a 20% DP and closing costs, I'll have a healthy EF/cash buffer so won't be cutting *too* dangerously close to the bone at closing.

It seems that 28% rule is meant to allow room for some combination of other financial obligations (be that other debts or having dependents). And though I plan to still contribute as aggressively to retirement, being on track there offers me some flexibility that others who are behind on saving may not have. **Is there something to this thinking?**

My home buying math:

* I earn $130-150k, depending on bonus. (At least $140k is reasonable to assume).
* Based on the 28% rule, I could afford $3266/mo.
* In my market, I could buy something that meets my needs for $550k. With a 20% DP and assuming a 7% rate, that's a $2,927 payment. After taxes and insurance, that number would exceed the above number and therefore the 28% rule â€“ but it's within stretching distance.

My financial picture:

* Total net worth: $310k.
   * Retirement savings: $150k (between my 401k, IRAs, and an HSA)
   * Downpayment: $110k
   * Remaining $50k to cover closing costs and EF/cash buffer.

Don't get me wrong, I'll feel on the tighter side to start. But if I can make it work for the first year or two, it *should* get easier with time. Otherwise, I fear I'll be stuck always playing leapfrog, each increase in income failing to actually improve affordability as home prices increase just as fast.",Yes,Yes,No,Yes,Yes
j29d2k,Ecstatic_Tiger_2534,"HSA Investing - fund minimums apply?

I'm in my first year of an HDHP w/ HSA plan and am contributing the maximum. I recently hit the minimum threshold to invest (anything above $2k), and was excited to see VFIAX as an option. Now, the provider (HRC Benefits) offers a pretty poor user experience. There's a long list of funds, with a link to view a fact sheet and the prospectus. The fact sheet makes no mention of a minimum investment, while the prospectus does (but in language that would be easy to misinterpret). I know from viewing the fun on Vanguard's website that the minimum investment is $3k.

I am pretty sure I can't go and invest my meager investable balance of \~$500 in HFIAX just yet. But it also appears that the HSA investing portal wouldn't have stopped me if I tried.

So my questions are two-fold: 1) am I wrong that I can't invest in VFIAX via my HSA until I hit a $3k investable balance? For example, does this work differently for HSAs? And 2) what would have hypothetically happened if I submitted my elections and included HFIAX, unaware of the minimum? Are there penalties?

kqfz1n,Ecstatic_Tiger_2534,"Gut check on buying a home?

M29, single, looking to buy as soon as this summer. Am I ready?

I'm in a HCOL city where a decent 1bd condo in an appreciating neighborhood goes for around $425k-$475k. Based on affordability calculators, that's right in my sweet spot. I *could* get more house on the dollar in the burbs, but, as a single young(ish) adult, staying near the urban core is still advantageous for me from a dating and social life perspective. I don't need much more than a 1bd condo anyway.

My plan *had* been to save until I had a 20% DP to avoid PMI. But given low interest rates and rapid appreciation in this market, I'm considering buying once I can do 10%, which would get me into the market a year (or more) sooner. I think my PMI would be reasonable given my strong credit score, and that I'd be able to drop it fairly quickly thanks to expected appreciation. Plus, with interest rates so low the math may favor making a lower DP in order to invest the difference into the market, even with the PMI accounted for.

How do I look? What am I not accounting for?

* Salary: $117k base salary, eligible for 15% annual bonus.
* Debts: $0. Had student loans and a car note, but all are paid off
* DP saved: $35k. I deposit $2.5k monthly. 
* Emergency fund: $12k. This is 6mo based of current *living* *expenses*, but I'm adding \~$1.4k monthly in order to reach 6mo of *take home pay* by the time I buy.
* Retirement: $65k between a 401k and Roth IRA. I put in 10% and employer matches 4%. I have zero desire to touch the principal or adjust my savings rate to make buying a home work.
* HSA: \~$3,550 after fully funding for one year. Intend to fully fund this year too.

Based on all the above, June would be when: my DP hits 10% *and* my EF hits 6mo take home pay. Additionally, my annual bonus (\~12K after taxes) should hit by the end of May, which I'd use to cushion closing and moving costs. Seems like there's no reason not to buy this summer, but hoping for either some validation or tough love, whichever may apply.

I'll have to submit the paperwork to have the Federal Reserve search for record of the missing bond, but I worry I may not have enough of the necessary information. I don't have the bond's serial number, nor do I have any clue when it was bought. The website seems to say that in absence of the serial number you'll need a pretty tight purchase date range, but I have neither.

I'm hoping someone here might be able to help identify when this specific slip design was used, so I can start to narrow down the possible years it was gifted to me. There obviously would have a specific year they began using it, and they may have later sunsetted it in a specific year. Perhaps the design evolved over the years too, which could provide a helpful clue. All I know is that this could have been gifted to me no earlier than 1990 and no later than 2009, when the gifter passed away.

The good news: I do have the SSN of the gifter and the denomination of the bond, and imagine those will help the Federal Reserve find the record tremendously.

I (29M) am in the market for a condo in an east coast, HCOL city.

I've largely avoided the obscene rents here by living with multiple roommates in lower-end apartments, but it's high time I move on into a place of my own. I was tempted a year ago to consider a $2-$2.5k 1bd, but decided to buckle down, save aggressively, and be able to buy my own place years sooner.

I think I'm ready to swing this, and am motivated to get in while the interest rates are low and before certain neighborhoods appreciate out of my budget again. My budget range has been $500-600k, but I'm leaning toward the upper end of that in order to make fewer trade-offs. (And just to be clear I'm not talking anything fancy. Even $600k is a mid-tier condo at best here.)

**Salary:** $120k, plus a 15% bonus that's been reliable to-date. There is plenty of growth potential above me within my current company and in my field, so I anticipate my earnings increasingly steadily in the years ahead.

**Downpayment/closing costs:** $65k, likely $70k by the earliest I could close on a place. Should be enough for around a 10% DP and closing costs.

**Emergency fund:** $15k. This was a comfortable 6+mo at my current living expenses, but I know it won't be enough with the big mortgage payments factored in. I'm working on growing this, but may elect to do a smaller DP in order to putt the remainder into my EF.

**Retirement:** A hair over $100k. I've been contributing 15-20%, and plan to maintain a similar contribution rate even with the condo.

**HSA:** $6k.

tlj04m,Ecstatic_Tiger_2534,"Is a smaller down payment still advantageous in light of higher interest rates?

When interest rates were as low as they were last year, there was a strong argument to be made for putting as little down as you could get away. Similarly, it seemed clearly better to stick to a full 30-year amortized repayment schedule than to consider a 15-year or to make early payments.

But with rates approaching 5%, at what point does this logic fall apart?

v70r60,Ecstatic_Tiger_2534,"Bonus hitting soon â€“ Should I have more of it hit my 401k now, and contribute less for the remainder of the year? Or should I do the opposite?

My bonus (\~$15k after tax) will hit next week. Before then, I can adjust what % of it goes into my 401k.

I'm already on track to max out my 401k based on regular paycheck contributions, so I would need to adjust those down for the remainder of the year accordingly.

So, in effect, it's a question of lump sum vs DCA'ing into my 401k.

Note, I'm on track to max out my 401k, IRA, and HSA regardless, so the excess income (either in the form of my checking account seeing more of my bonus now or more of my paychecks later) would mostly get invested in my taxable either way.

Given that, it feels *mostly* inconsequential what I do. But I'm sure there are considerations I'm failing to consider. How would you approach this?",Yes,Yes,No,Yes,No
w2a6zu,Ecstatic_Tiger_2534,"Is there such a thing as saving too much for retirement, if it's getting in the way of buying a home?

I'm no longer in the market to buy immediately, but am thinking about my strategy for when the time next feels right. 

Looking back on last year, the big question on my mind is whether my priorities too strongly favored retirement saving, so much that I got in my own way when it came to buying a place of my own. I had maxed out my 401k, IRA, and HSA for a couple of years, and was insistent on continuing to be able to do that. I limited my budget accordingly, but it made buying in my HCOL market difficult.

My question is this: at what point are you in good enough shape re: retirement that it becomes justifiable to slow that down a bit in order to divert more cashflow to affording a home?

zebmap,Ecstatic_Tiger_2534,"How would you make the most on downpayment savings while waiting out the RE market?

Like many who were hoping to buy a home last year but who have been sidelined by rising mortgage rates and the shifting RE market, I have a decent chunk of DP savings sitting around. I have $70k in a HYSA earning 3.2% (not bad!) and $20k in I-Bonds. I no longer plan to use this for a DP immediately, but do want to keep the option open in the relative near-term (i.e. reconsidering the market by next fall). Stock market is out, obviously.

How would you make the most of this cash on hand?

Come January, I could put $10k into a new I-Bond purchase, but I'm not sure that this is still worthwhile. The current 6.89% rate for 6mo is still great, but I anticipate the following six months will be lower.

If I move some cash to a 1yr CD or Treasury ladder, I could earn somewhere around 4.7% risk-free. This would lock up some cash for as long as a year, but I think this is fairly compatible with the soonest I can realistically see myself buying.

I could shuffle a chunk between online savings accounts offering sign-up bonuses, earning comparable APY's to my current HYSA while collecting some sizable bonuses along the way. For example, if I move $50k to a Discover Online Savings Account for 60 days, then to a Citi Accelerate HYSA for 90 days, I could collect $950 in bonuses on top of a 2.75% and 3.1% APY respectively. I'd keep total flexibility to use that cash at any time penalty-free (other than possibly sacrificing a SUB), but feels like the most logistical hassle of my options.

* Put as much down as possible (3% minimum, 20% = no mortgage insurance)
* I may have to pay mortgage insurance
* Property tax is going to suck
* I need to maintain a good credit score

What other things should I watch out for? What legalese might screw me over on a mortgage loan document? What unexpected costs should I be aware of? Is it actually worth buying a home when our 900 square foot, 2 bed/2 bath apartment is only charging $850 a month?",Yes,Yes,No,No,Yes

Just a quick snapshot of our financial situation as it regards these things.

* We are paying $2,600 a month for our mortgage. It began in February, and the interest rate is 5.928%
   * We are still in that escrow period, so mortgage insurance is taken out of that payment each month
* Student loan payments are going to begin soon. Because they're a pain in the neck, we have 10 separate ones, all with different balances and interest rates.

We already don't eat out, we don't buy name brand anything, we thrift shop, we meal plan, etc. Our expenses are not going to change at this point. It is this area that we have to play around with our choices. My gut reaction is to pay the ""standard"" monthly payments on the student loans for 10 years (taking this out of the 401ks), continue to pay the normal payment on the mortgage, and don't change anything else. I think the math checks out on that, as the mortgage has the highest interest rate, but it shouldn't beat the returns on the investments in the long run. We're playing the long game here.

The other option is to pull back hard on the investments and knock out the loans in a year or two with the REPAYE options. It would reduce the overall cost of paying off our loans by several thousand.

esd6a6,Elarionus,"Good program for keeping track of finances

I've been wanting to keep better track of my finances for a while now. I'm pretty good at budgeting, and I know where my money is going. I just want to get more specific with it. I thought about using Mint, but Mint is not compatible with my Banner Bank credit card, so nothing shows up from it. I also looked into YNAB, but I don't want to pay a subscription fee, and I feel like I want much more control of it than that. I want to keep track of everything, from my student loans, to debit card purchases, to savings accounts, to credit card purchases, rent, gas, food, etc.

When I remove various pieces of it, sometimes 20-30 rows of stuff I don't need on there, it breaks a lot of other things.

I'm about to set up joint accounts with my wife, and I'm trying to find a good group to go through. I know that there are banks and I know that there are credit unions.

I currently just have an account set up with Banner Bank for personal use. She has one through a credit union in our state, though the credit union doesn't have a branch for roughly 300 miles of where we're located.

All of this being the case, I have a few questions:

1. What's stopping us from just opening a joint account through Banner Bank? Or the credit union she has an account with? Is there a reason to jump ship?
2. As long as a group is FDIC insured, I'm good to use it and trust that my money won't vanish, right?
3. I don't know anything about retirement plans or IRAs or anything. I know that my job doesn't have that stuff. Her job might, we don't know yet. Do we need to pick a specific bank/union to go with for that?
4. Finally, is it better to go with a larger credit union over a smaller, even when there's no local branch for it? We could go with hers, but like I said, the nearest in person branch is roughly 300 miles away. We could do shared branching here, but there are two credit unions based in our town, right here.

* Fun Spending (mostly skiing this winter) 17%
* Transportation (tires, gas, maintenance) 15%
* Long Term (Investments, House Savings, Emergency Fund) 15%
* Gifts/Donations (Tithe, Birthdays, Christmas) 8%
* Medical (PT, Dentist, Eyecare) 5%
* Subscription Services (Spotify/Amazon) 1%

It's a little tricky for me to wrap my head around still, because the tax percentages change throughout the year, and net income ends up being different from gross income, which also means that our savings percentage will be different because the 401K comes out before that 15% going into house, betterment, and EF, etc....

There's just a lot going on here for me to keep track of. What should our next steps be for financial success? Should we open up a Roth IRA to make that $6,000 yearly cap alongside our 401K?

zzhtol,Elarionus,"My spouse and I both work. I think we're thinking about W-4s wrong, and we're looking for correction.

We  just went through the IRS calculator, and it's telling us that we may  receive a return of nearly $9,000. We're not sure why. We used the  tables in the 2022 W-4 form for the ""two jobs"" section. Her salary was  at around $75,000 for the first six months of 2022, and then $85,000 for  the last six months of 2022. Mine stayed consistent at around $50,000,  though I worked overtime, so mine came out a bit different.

I  ended the year at $54,000 gross with $3,000 withheld in federal taxes.  She ended the year at $81,000 gross with $12,500 withheld in federal  taxes. There are other things that complicate this, such as our FSA and a  few other benefits her work offers (we utilize the Roth 401k, not  traditional).

We are filling out  new W-4s for 2023 now. I noticed that in the two jobs section, we can  choose to either use the tables, or just check the box and move on,  leaving the extra withholding section empty. Right now, based on the  tables, she should have an additional $340 withheld every paycheck (she  is paid twice monthly). If we leave it blank, that would mean there's a  $7,600 difference, right?

We don't  want to get to April of 2024 and suddenly owe $7,600. But if we really  did overpay our taxes in extreme amounts this year, we wouldn't want to  do that again either. This year felt lean.

To clarify, our annual wages next year should be around $52,000 for me and $85,000 for her.

EDIT: We also tried the Nerdwallet calculator, and it gave us a result of a $1,000 return. I think we missed the small traditional 401k contributions that were made in the beginning of the year. We had forgotten those had happened, as they were an accident.",Yes,Yes,No,No,Yes

I just financed a new car with lowest possible rate I could get, 4.99% for 48 months. If I follow 48 months, I will end up paying almost $3200 in interest.

Thankfully we are both in health care fields with above average outlook and have advanced degrees._x000D_

OUR GOALS: 

_x000D_  
\-	Buy a new car (Toyota Cross SUV Hybrid $30K). We currently own 2 old Toyota corollas with over 200K miles on each. Weâ€™re going to hold on to both as our backup cars since we truly only need one (she works from home). _x000D_  
\-	We are undergoing IVF treatment as the first step to conceiving through surrogacy. Her job contributes $10K towards IVF so we will pay $5k out of pocket (15k total). _x000D_  
\-	In a year or so (or as soon as possible), we will proceed with surrogacy, which will be another $80 to $120K. You have to pay a big chunk of that up front when starting the process. _x000D_  
_x000D_  
FUNDING OPTIONS:

_x000D_  
My wifeâ€™s father is willing to lend us $50K, with interest, once we need it. Probably like 5-6% interest. _x000D_  
\-	As I said, her job will re-imburse us 10K for IVF. _x000D_  
\-	Weâ€™re looking into Toyotaâ€™s factory financing at 2.9% for 36 months for the Corolla Cross, but are open to credit unions if we decide 36 months is too short of a term (keeping in mind we need all we can have on hand for surrogacy).  _x000D_  
\-	Our credit scores are excellent. Never make any late payments on anything. My FICO is 823, Equifax 783 and last time I checked her #s were at tiny bit higher. _x000D_  
\-	Some IVF lending Cos may offer as little as 0% APR, with up to 84 month terms. We could use that for the 15K (Iâ€™m guessing we could then pocket the 10K perk from her job and use towards car/surrogacy). _x000D_  
\-	We can use factory financing (2.9%) or credit union (\~7% Iâ€™m guessing) for car loan ($26k financing). _x000D_  
\-	Borrowing against 401k or home equity are not completely off the table although last resort. _x000D_  
\-	And hopefully within 6-12 months, with our savings and her dadâ€™s loan we can start surrogacy process.  _x000D_

I am changing jobs and found out I will have a gap in between paychecks I wasnâ€™t aware of before. My final paycheck will be on June 30th, in the amount of $1701.39. I will not get paid again until August 4th and the amount right now isnâ€™t totally certain (it depends on insurance costs and whether or not I decide to split my paycheck over 10 months or 12), but my total salary is $51,308.

I currently have $938 in the bank. $650 set aside for rent (I split the total cost between two paychecks by putting a chunk of money into a savings account), $174.45 in a savings account for a personal loan Iâ€™m paying off (again, I split the total cost between two paychecks), and $114 in checking.

When I get paid on the 30th, Iâ€™ll have a grand total of $2,639.39 in the bank. This money will go towards four things, plus food and gas: tithe ($170.13 - this is non-negotiable and advice to â€œstop tithingâ€ is not advice I need or want), the other portion of rent (~$920), the other half of the loan ($174.45), and my phone bill ($71.02). I also have a final internet bill to pay ($47.91). I will obviously need to buy food (~$40) and gas (~$35) at some point, but trying to stretch this out as far as I can, which should be easy, being a teacher on summer break. So altogether, my expenses will total $2,205, which will leave me about $435 in the bank. This $435 will have to go towards one (or more) other bills when I donâ€™t get paid again on the 15th of July. These are:

- Loan: $174.45

- Apple: $7.55 (music and storage)

I have two credit cards - one with a balance of $917 and the other, a balance of $6000.

I now have $2k in a separate savings account, which is enough to cover one monthâ€™s expenses and then some. Since reaching $2k, Iâ€™ve shifted to splitting the leftover money only between the two credit cards.

Using my current budget (which does not account for bonuses or an upcoming pay raise), Iâ€™m due to pay off the $917 credit card by August, even with an added ~$40 a month in interest rates and fees. However, looking at my main bank account right now, I realized that what I have in *that* savings + $10 transferred from checking would be enough to pay my credit card in full.

t3u12v,EllieD0113,"Possibly refinancing an auto loan, want to make sure Iâ€™m doing the smartest thing

My current loan is through PNC. My amount financed was $10,881.36 with a 6.29% APR for 72 months. Grand total of loan: $13,126.32 with a monthly payment of $182.31. I have been making payments since September 2020 and have $8,392.07 left of the principal balance ($8,417.72 balance total).

I cannot refinance through PNC because I live in Tennessee, so I reached out and have been talking with Fleet Financial/iLending Direct. Theyâ€™re offering me a fixed loan of $9,692 with a 5.5% interest rate for 72 months. Grand total of loan: $11,400.97 with a monthly payment of $158.35. If I deny optional gap coverage, my monthly payment would be $146.35.

I live in Nashville, where rent is only getting higher and higher.

I live in Nashville and make just shy of $53k, on track to make $55k by next summer (guaranteed 5% raise every year).

Iâ€™ve been approved for a $230k FHA loan with an okay rate (6.6). I really want to stay at or under $200k to ensure Iâ€™m not house poor. However, with that price point, Iâ€™m either getting old single family homes that havenâ€™t been remodeled or newer(ish) townhouses - which I run the risk of not getting FHA approved.

The second option is a construction-to-permanent loan. I have a plot of land picked out and a house plan, both of which (including paying the contractor) would put me well within the ideal price range and I get a new home. But I also know construction can quickly run over cost *and* thereâ€™s a lot to do since itâ€™s unimproved land. I also have seen too much shoddy construction these days. Plus, the lot isnâ€™t in the most desirable area (no restaurants, nearest grocery is a Wal-Mart and all other places are at least a 10 minute drive).

So my last option is to rent. My monthly price point is between 1300-1400 and thatâ€™ll get me a decent apartment in the Nashville area. I donâ€™t have to bother with upkeep or maintenance issues, plus I get all the amenities. Iâ€™m just tired of moving and tired of rising rent prices.

105df9m,engineheat2,"newbie question on IRA and HSA

Hi,

Got 2 newbie questions...

1. I currently already max out the 401k my employer provides and I also have a Roth IRA account on Fidelity. I wonder if I'm also able to get another tax deferred IRA on my own. By tax deferred I mean you don't get taxed on it now, only when you withdraw after retirement, just like 401k.
2. I haven't contributed anything to HSA but I'm thinking about it. My original rationale is that I live a healthy lifestyle so I probably won't have much health related expenses. I also misunderstood it, thinking one can only use HSA funds for health related things. But now I learned that  you can also use HSA funds for non-health related things. This got me wondering, then wouldn't the money I put into a HSA now sort of act like an additional contribution like the 401k? As I understand, **after age 65,** one can use the HSA funds for non-health related things, it just has to be taxed like a 401k withdraw, but there's **no additional** penalties. So if I want to maximize my tax deferred retirement savings, I should contribute to a HSA as well.

Please advise.

10c15k3,engineheat2,"buying US Treasury bill VS putting money into a CD

I have significant cash saved up and is looking to use it in a year or two to purchase a house (first time). In the meantime, I'm deciding between using most of it to buy 3/6 month US treasury bill vs putting it into a CD. On Fidelity, the yield for both are similar, but the treasury bill might be around 0.2% higher, say 4.7% vs 4.5%.

Although the treasury bill is considered a risk-free investment (in terms of getting the principle back), I wonder if it's still not ""guaranteed"" like a CD? In another word, is the slightly higher yield worth the additional ""risk"" (if any) of buying treasury bills over a CD?

Also, when you buy treasury bill on an exchange like Fidelity, you can sell it before maturity so that offers some flexibility in case one needs liquidity sooner. If you get a CD you don't have that option right?

The ""standardized return %"" for a money market fund looks like this:

1-month: 0.37

3-month: 1:13

YTD: 0.76

I wonder if standardized return means the return % standardized to the time interval given. So if I look at the 1-month, that means whatever money 1 month ago has gone up by 0.37%. And with that, I can extrapolate what the annualized return would be by multiplying by 12 (assuming the same return, which is not realistic, but it does help one understand standardized return). Is that right? If so, I'm kind curious why the 1-month return is less than 1/3 of the 3-month return, given that interest rate has been rising and you'd think there be a greater return in more recent months. I'd expect the return in say, March would be bigger than in January.

The YTD is drastically less than the 3-month. Given that this figure was taken yesterday, it hasn't been 3 month into 2023 yet, but we are only 10 days away or so.

I'm single, in my 30s. My rent has gone from $1300 to $1500 and I got 3 month till my lease ends. I live in the Midwest and I'm deciding whether to buy a house or continue renting. The unique thing about me is that while I like the city I'm at, I do plan on spending 50% of my time else where. Currently, I'm trying to convince my employer to allow me to live a digital nomad lifestyle. They do have a policy that allows ""location free"" roles but I'm not sure they will grant it to me. It'll be a few month before I find a good opportunity to ask or get an answer on this. If they turn me down, I might need to look for another job which further complicates things. 

Anyway, I see a house that sells for $140k (HOA: $280 monthly, property tax: $1300 annual). I do have the savings to buy it with cash. Assuming I spend 50% of my time away:

Renting:  $1500 \* 12 = $18000 a year, with half of that or $9000 wasted if I'm not here.

Buying with cash: Lost interest income of roughly $7k annually assuming interest rate of 5%. $4660 goes to HOA and property tax. That brings the total cost to $11660, which is much lower than renting. 

Although there's a chance that property values can go down, people say it can't be more than 10%, this is not 2008, blah blah blah.

It's a 2 bedroom house so I might even rent out a room for, say, $900 a month and tell them they get to have the whole house to themselves for half the time.  That'll almost cover the $11600 in annual housing costs so I'll be living for free for the time that I'm in town.

I'm 35 now, single. My monthly income after taxes and 401k contribution is about $7500. I pay about $1500 in rent and spend another $1k, so I save $5k a month. I got about $200k saved that I plan to set aside to buy a home soon. Right now they are in 3 month Treasury bills. I got a tiny bit of stock and ETFs, maybe around $20k worth. I actually took a loss on them in 2022 and I missed out on the AI rally this year after fear selling some in 2022 and selling more when the SP500 was around 4200 this year. I think I learned my lesson about timing the market so I plan on just doing consistent dollar cost averaging into VOO from now to retirement. I plan to just buy $2k worth each month of VOO from now. That'll simplify my decision. I have an individual and Roth account on Fidelity.

I wonder if I can/should redeem them now and place the money in higher yielding investments like T-bills. 

I don't think I can redeem the one issued on 1/12/2023 because I think you need to wait a year. But would it be prudent to redeem the one issued on 4/18/2022 now?

1776wa4,engineheat2,"Want to break a lease, can I negotiate to minimize penalty?

Hi,

I live in Ohio and I want to hear your advice on how I can break a lease while minimizing financial penalty.

Two weeks ago, I signed a 6-months lease for an apartment after seeing it. At the time, there was an odor in the apartment and I thought it was paint and would dissipate quickly, since they tell me they paint each unit with each turnover. Upon moving in, the odor has not dissipated even after my attempts at airing it out. I contacted management and was told that it is due to the new carpet they installed. They offered to steam clean it which I accepted but it has not helped much. Now, two weeks later, the smell is still bothering me with no end in sight. I tried air purifiers with active carbon and it still doesnâ€™t eliminate it completely. Moreover, with winter coming up, my ventilation options would be limited which would make it worse.

It might be that Iâ€™m more sensitive than most. But the smell is really bothering me and makes me uncomfortable. Home is a place I dread going back to. I really regret signing the lease but to terminate it, Iâ€™d lose on 2 months worth of rent. I wonder if I can try to negotiate with them to terminate the lease at a lower penalty? (say, 1 month), or have them refund me if they find a new tenant early. 

Yes, I understand I signed the lease and agreed to the clauses in it. I also understand my reason is probably not going to be accepted by the court. Life throws us curveballs and sometimes we just have to take the loss. But I feel itâ€™s such a heavy penalty to charge a tenant 2 months worth of rent, and I heard in Ohio courts can sometimes make them refund you back some money if they are able to find a tenant sooner. Ideally I can just settle with them and get out. Whatâ€™s your advice?

Thanks",Yes,Yes,No,Yes,Yes
17abczo,engineheat2,"Breaking a lease, did I just cost myself big?

I moved into an apt this month and discovered that it has an odor due to new carpet and makes me unwell. It's been weeks and it has not subsided. I contacted management and they steam cleaned it but it didn't help. Other tenants tells it took months for the odor to go away. I measured the VOC level and it's high.

I want to break my lease as I dread going to the apartment. Here's the lease clause:

EARLY TERMINATION. Provided there is no event of default by Resident under this Lease either at the time of exercise or on the date of early termination, Resident shall have the right to terminate this Lease prior to the Ending Date subject to the satisfaction of the following
conditions: (a) Resident shall provide written notice to Owner of its intent to exercise the early termination right not less than sixty (60) days prior
to the desired early termination date; and (b) at the time of providing such notice, Resident shall pay to Owner an early termination fee (the â€œEarly
Termination Feeâ€) equal to the sum of: (i) all unpaid Rent then outstanding under this Lease; plus (ii) an amount equal to two hundred percent
(200%) of the current Monthly Rent. Upon satisfaction of the foregoing conditions, the date for early termination as set forth in Residentâ€™s Termination Notice shall be deemed the Ending Date as set forth herein.

I understand it as even if I notify them tomorrow 10/18, I'd still need to pay rent till 12/18 due to the 60 day notice requirement and on top of that, 2 months worth of rent.

Is that correct? This is making me pretty depressed as I feel the fault is not 100% mine and it's a large chunk of money for a place I don't even want to live in anymore.

17nwx2a,engineheat2,"Should I buy a house next year in this bad market?

I know housing prices are at a all time high but so is rent and I'm tired of leases, moving.

I'm 38, single and lives in the Midwest. I make $140k and my current rent is about $1500. A starter condo in my area is about $200k, at around $170 to $200 per sqft. HOA runs about $250 per month and property tax is probably around $3k per year.

I got $150k saved in my 401k and I maximize my contribution to it along with HSA. Each month my take home is $6k and I save about $3500 after all expenses and so far I have around $330k saved and most of that is on Fidelity where a small portion is in Roth and most of it are in Treasury bills.

I'm deciding whether to buy a starter house next year (and possibly pay cash?) as opposed to renting and hoping the housing prices would drop, which many ppl say won't be for awhile.

Another option is to move in with a coworker of mine, who has offered me a master bedroom for $750 per month. That would obviously save me money, but I wonder if I can do better by buying a 2 bedroom condo for $200k and rent out a room myself?

I will be living in this city for the foreseeable future and I figure if I pay cash on a $200k condo and rent out a room for about $800 per month, that'll make up the lost interest I get from the Treasury bills, and then my expenses would be the taxes and HOAs and maybe some maintenance, which would be lower than the rent I pay now, and maybe even lower than if I moved in with my roommate.

Upon returning, another associate looked at the ""documentation"" that the previous associate or the company had, and told me I'm good to go. I told him the car was like that before I got it, and he said it's all good since he looked at the ""documentation."" I later got my electronic receipt.

10ic9c6,Expert_Diamond8099,"Average savings for 18 y/o

Hey everyone, Iâ€™m 18, work retail making 15/hr, have $850 invested between a Roth IRA and brokerage account, (also have 401k through the company Iâ€™m with) and I have about $650 in savings. 

I am going to attend an online school for a bachelors in Finance and will live at home at least for the first year, and maybe more. I plan on getting a job at one of the local banks as a teller to be able to 1) make a consistent paycheck, 2) get consistent hours (40 per week) and 3) to be able to have my evenings off to study. Since I am going to an online school it is considerably cheaper ($3500 a semester) than an in person school and my parents have told me that they will cover the majority of it if I could help with $750-$1000 a semester. 
However, at some point I would really like to move out, whether itâ€™s in a year or even longer to the state where a lot of my family is and my girlfriend also lives. I would be moving from Texas to Oklahoma. 

I was wondering how much I would need to have saved to be able to move out of state and live an apartment?

If I get the job at the bank I plan on saving everything I make, especially since I am only having to pay for a small portion of my college and I donâ€™t have to pay any bills or anything. I know that tellers in my area make about $25k a year, so if I could save $20k of that, I would be in a pretty decent spot. 

Any thoughts on how much I need to save to move? Or advice for a full time employee/ college student?",Yes,Yes,No,Yes,No

However, I would really like to put a majority of my investment money into index funds. Is this safe? I know that you can get over diversified if you invest in overlapping funds (schd and sphd) and thatâ€™s not good.

110bfyr,Expert_Diamond8099,"Thoughts on Apple in the future?

What would a bullish case on Apple be? I donâ€™t think that they are going anywhere due to the fact that their software and products are integrated in many different places. But at times, I worry that companies such as google, Apple, and Microsoft may have their most profitable days behind them because technology is already apart of our lives and not some huge fad like it was 20-30 years ago. To be clear, I still think they are good buys (especially now), thatâ€™s just a concern I have thought about

So hereâ€™s my case on why you should buy Apple for the next 5+ years 

Over the next 5-10 years, I believe more 3rd world countries will start adopting technology even more than they already have. And Apple will undoubtedly be apart of this integration. 

Apple is currently working on a car. Now, nobody really knows how far in production the car is, but a lot of people are reporting it would be released in 3 years (2026). I donâ€™t think that Apple will release it unless itâ€™s perfect, but if they do than it will probably be a huge hit. 

Lastly, Apple has bought more AI software firms than any other company (including meta). I believe that over the next few years they will start integrating softwares such as Chatgpt into their search engine functions. 

Am I missing something? What do you think about Apple?",Yes,Yes,No,Yes,Yes

Job 1 (Current Job)- I work at a retail store making $15/hour and roughly get 10-15 hours per paycheck (I get paid every other week). Itâ€™s pretty easy, and I donâ€™t have a set schedule so I would sometimes work mornings, some times I would work evenings. 

Job 2- This would be a bank teller position that I would receive through a connection I have as well as a business program I am involved in through my high school. I am almost guaranteed a job through this program. I would make $12/hour and get a guaranteed 40 hours per week as well as insurance, tuition reimbursement and stock options. 

I like Option 1 because I could always get a second job if I went with that option, but I would be able to study a lot more than I would at option 2 and I would have a lot more free time, but get a fraction of the money.

101sd74,ExplanationDazzling1,"My plan is to pay this Mitsubishi truck off as fast as possible! I never knew how much I hated having a car loan

I donâ€™t like my Mitsubishi truck and the dealership sold it to me AS IS. So Iâ€™m stuck with it I guess.
So I make 68k per year and out of impulse I bought a $18,988 Mitsubishi Outlander Sport SE truck 2020. Low mileage when I bought it 12,241 miles! Now itâ€™s 13,124 miles. Pretty great on gas mileage I do have to say because of the automatic eco mode. 

Edit: Monthly payment is $409.06 and APR 9.45% 
Credit score is 758 since I made an early $1,000 payment Dec 21. If you see my old posts at first they tried to make my $1000 extend for 3 months so my next payment was in March at $227. But nope I called them up and told them that is for Dec month my next payment should be Jan 21. So now Iâ€™m back on schedule 

Anyways with taxes and dealership throwing gps/theft premium total is $20,588 I couldâ€™ve got something else but it had everything I wanted. Iâ€™ve been driving it for almost a month now. I checked kbb and my car is worth 17k. Each month my car is depreciating and I wanna sell it after it pay it off â€¦ 

Jan 10 will make a month and Iâ€™m already tired of the car. My first car payment is due Jan 21. I only have 16k in the bank, $3000 in my savings account and $1,000 in my 401k. 

I donâ€™t like monthly car payments so my plan is to pay 3,000 each month until I get rid of this car loan. Thatâ€™s 7 monthly payments. In July I will be done with my car payments. If anyone asks I will say I paid full cash for it. Iâ€™m just tired of it. I thought I liked having a huge display of playing pandora, YouTube and google maps that activate Siri. But nope Iâ€™m more simple. I like simplicity! 

Now the truck I have is pretty simple nothing too out of the ordinary but I do miss opening my truck with my keys and my CD player. Or my favorite  lifting the latch to open my trunk. I guess I truly miss my Honda 2006 because it had all that.

Anyways I donâ€™t like the truck Iâ€™m in and dealership sold it to me AS IS. I wanna pay it off really quickly and trade it in for something I reeeaaallly want! Which is a Toyota  Hybrid. Something with less mileage. The reason I chose Mitsubishi over toyota in the first place is because they want 25k+ and the toyota cars in my budget have wayyyy too much mileage on them.

Was curious about my pre approval from Bank of America and BAM I got a great deal than the credit unions. 

Iâ€™m currently at 9.45% interest rate at 84 months with Capital One. And just found out that Bank of America is offering me 6.59% APR at 48 months! Iâ€™m knowing monthly payment might sky rocket but man that APR sounds good â€¦",No,Yes,No,No,Yes

So Iâ€™m with Capital One Auto Loan and I decided to pay toward my principal only thinking I can get rid of interest altogether. Well my bill was due yesterday and I made a payment to pay my bill on the principal only. So today I checked my account and it shows I am past due. So next month I owe Capital One 812.00. I was curious why my car note jump from 406 to 812! So Iâ€™m thinking damn so the more you pay on principal the more the car note goes up I guess. 

So then I did the math. Wait a damn minute it looks like my car note doubled. What about my principal? So my principal payment wasnâ€™t factored into my auto loanâ€¦ Capital One looks at that as 2 different payments. God DAMN! So now how will credit card companies and refinance places look at me when they find out Iâ€™m late on my first car payment? My life is over and my credit score will go down. 

I thought I was getting rid of interest by paying on my principal only but it turns out banks are very smart and they will get their money. Thereâ€™s no way out of interest. So this morning I found out Capital One has a 10 day grace period so I just paid it today and my payment should process on Monday. Iâ€™m gonna call capital one and let them know about my mistake. All these terms when it comes to finances are new to me and I thought by just paying the principal balance I would get rid of interest but sadly life is not that easy.

Bought my car Dec 10 at 21k with 12k miles on it. I now have almost 15k miles on it and it is now Feb 4. I paid 3k to get out of under the water. I paid it toward the principal only balance, also cancelled my gap insurance and warranty. So now I only owe 13,800. And my interest is going up daily. $3.56 * 30 is how they calculate it. Not sure what they mean by this but my first actual car payment was Jan 21 and man they are me up interest. 

Just recently bought a crossover to travel to and from work. 50 miles a day is a lot and it has taken a toll on me mentally. Financially I can handle it. 13k left on my car note. My car insurance is a bit high. Itâ€™s $160 per month. My car note is $409 per month with a 9.45% APR. My credit is 758 but the dealership financed me with capital one. This was my mistake but I didnâ€™t know. Just made my first payment and it was $455 and my interest was so high they took $287 and only $168 went toward my principal. 

I have a 2020 Mitsubishi Outlander Sport. I feel like I got hosed really bad but I needed a car so bad after I totaled my 2006 Honda Accord. 

Now I have a very personal decision to make and I need advice. 

Option 1: Sell my car to Carmax for 16-17k. Iâ€™ll only bring over like 3k in positive equity. So then Iâ€™ll pay cash for a 2014 Toyota Prius with 84k miles for $14,000. Title, doc fee and license plate transfer I feel like Iâ€™m looking at an additional +2k. But the car insurance will significantly go down $114. So I will be paying approximately $50-60. Not only that I will save so much money on gas too. Itâ€™s a 50mpg with 13 fuel tank. I would like to pay cash for the 2014 Toyota Prius but it seems like itâ€™s a lot but Iâ€™m going to take it for a test drive 

Option 2: Trade in or sell my crossover for a 16-17k 2021 Toyota Corolla LE. Not sure how reliable it is but Iâ€™ll save $25 on car insurance. This will save a little on gas as itâ€™s a 30/38 MPG. Itâ€™s better MPG than my crossover my crossover is 27/30 MPG. So my car insurance will be $135. Refinance at the same credit union at 6.99%

In all honesty I donâ€™t like my crossover that much as the drivability is kind of bumpy and not as smooth. It has a CVT transmission FWD so thatâ€™s probably why? Option 1 and Option 2 also has a CVT transmission FWD and 1.8 4 Cylinder. At least the Mitsubishi has 2.0 4 Cylinder. Thatâ€™s one factor that saves me on gas plus the eco mode.

I had it for only 3 months and I paid it off. I paid $21,400 for it altogether. I liked it at first until I realized I would rather a more fuel efficient car and reliable car. I no longer want a cool looking sports car that drops value like a rock. What really grabbed my attention was the headlights and fog lights. I bought this crossover solely from emotion and pretty looks. I wasnâ€™t thinking about gas mileage at the time. I later found out my mistubishi has a CVT transmission and every time I accelerate on the gas it sounds like a hungry, hungry hippo and then it goes away. The CarPlay is cool but my speaker could be better. The heated seats donâ€™t stay hot for long.. and my heat could be better too. 

Fast forward I have the title for my crossover I just have to get the lien holder released from the title. So Iâ€™ll be going to the dmv soon. Afterwards I could trade my car in for something I like better and more fuel efficient. The current specs on my car:

Vin begins with J so I automatically thought it was reliable. J = Japan 

27 fuel economy 
24 city and 30 highway 

Car insurance: $171.00 ( Iâ€™m not sure why my insurance is so high for this vehicle) I didnâ€™t know it was gonna be this high at the dealership 

I pay $40-50 each week for gas money so thatâ€™s $120 per month. My last billing statement from Samâ€™s Club was in Feb at $130 and Feb at $140

I want a more fuel efficient car with cheaper car insurance

On my mind I am looking at the 2016-2020 Toyota Yaris as an even trade with no down payment. The specs are phenomenal. 

Vin begins with 3. 3 = Mexico so this is reliable too

32/40 MPG City/Hwy

Transmission: Automatic ( Itâ€™s difficult to find cars with no CVT at a reasonable price these days)

Very clean title like my mistubishi. I do see it went to the auction but so did mine. 

Car insurance: If Mitsubishi Replaced my insurance states the following: 

Your 6-Month Policy Premium Will Decrease By
$117.20

So not only Iâ€™ll save on gas but my insurance will be much cheaper!",,,,,

1276nya,ExplanationDazzling1,"Savings Account APY is 0.45% but what is the APR?

Honestly feel like this credit union ripped off my mom. I never asked her about her savings until a few months ago just to make certain she is earning great money on her money. 


Story time:

My mother came across a $80,000 settlement and she put it at a credit union. They only have a 0.45% APY. After finding out her APY I was angry because she doesnâ€™t know much about APY and HYSA! Now did my research and found out she can move it. Sheâ€™s looking to move it to a CD at the same credit union. 

Now the APY is 4.15% and the APR is 4.05% 

How does APR work?? I wannna put her money in a savings account that she can gain more money. 

We just found out her retirement was in a IRA with a 0.45% interest rate too! She placed $1,000 back in the year of 2000 maybe 2001 in her IRA. So each month she gets $1.64.. in 1 year thatâ€™s  $19.68. She had her IRA for 21 years. 

In 21 years she only got $3,000. Someone please with financial knowledge let me know 

What is APR savings? I know APY is annual percentage yield and the higher the better the interest rate! But what is APR and why is it placed on a CD? 

Right now I have my $3,000 in a HYSA 
I have a 3.60% APY. Started it in December 2023 and I earned $16.00 already and now itâ€™s March. 

So my question is.. Should my mom move her money to a CD for 18 months? 

CD for 18 months:
APY is 4.15% and the APR is 4.05%
Iâ€™m not certain how APR works. I donâ€™t want my mom to be getting ripped off",,,,,

You know where you are now but youâ€™ll never know where youâ€™ll end up. 

Bank Account - $18,000.00 with no savings account or 401k
Car Accident October 2022 - Totaled my 2006 car 
October-November Bank Account 22k 
December 2022 - Purchased 2020 car worth 17k car which totaled to 21k
First car buyer Financed the 2020 car with a 9.45% interest rate
April 2023 - 25k with 3k savings account and put 6% on my 401k. 401k $1,000.00 
Realized I bought too much car and paid off the 21k in March
Bank Account $4,000, savings account $3,000 and 401k $1,000.00

Fast forward August 2023:

Bank Account $19,955.00, savings account $3,0093 and 401k $6,000 with a car worth 17k now. Carmax offered me 17k for it

Saved my money religiously, lived under my means and just went to work every single day. 
If I didnâ€™t get in that car accident Iâ€™ll be worth double then what Iâ€™m worth now. During the time I bought my car I couldnâ€™t find absolutely anything and cars were being sold with very high mileage at an expensive price. So I took a leap of faith with a 2020 suv with 12k miles. Iâ€™m not at 23k miles. 

If I did not get in that car accident I never wouldâ€™ve got a 401k or savings account. If I was to sell the car today and buy a used cheap one I would have almost 40k

My goal is to travel out of state once I reach my goal 20k. I do regret buying the car and wish I just rented it out until I found a car at a comfortable budget. But I look at this as a learning experience. My car went from 21k to 17k. Carmax offered me 17k. I look at this as just renting a car. Cars depreciate so much over time. The car is okay I mean it gets me from point A to point B. But just because itâ€™s a 2020 doesnâ€™t make it better than my 2006 Honda. I donâ€™t plan on keeping this car until the wheels fall off. When I get in a better financial situation Iâ€™m trading it over for a car that fits me more! 

Carmax - If I just sale the car they offered me 17k
Carmax - If I trade in my car they offered me 19k 

Down the line Iâ€™m looking to trade my car in for a nicer and faster car. 

FICO credit Score went from 771 to 790 now that I have purchase history 

Finally things happen in life and I was in a depression. Dealership told me I couldnâ€™t return the car and I had terrible buyers remorse. Now Iâ€™m doing much better and I realized I was the only one that could get out of that dark place. In 6 months I cut everything off. Distractions and social media and look where I am now?

I got in a major car accident last year with my 2006 Honda accord. I had 19k in the bank and a paid off car. After totaling my Honda car prices were at an all time high. I got really impatient and annoyed and bought a 2020 Mitsubishi Outlander for 21k. Next thing I know I had 3k in my bank account. No savings or 401k. 

Fast forward this year I have 3k in my savings account, 19k in my bank account and 5k in my 401k. I get paid $4,000.00 each month. My car is paid off and I have positive equity in it. I received an appraisal from Carmax letting me know that they will give me 17k for my 2020 Mitsubishi Outlander. I donâ€™t really like the car anymore. The trade in value is around 18k. I donâ€™t see any cars in the market that suits me not even the 2023 cars. 

I owe approximately $18,720.00 in student loan debt. If I sell this car I will be really close to my goal to pay off my student loan debt.

Yes I was young and naive. But we must go through shit to learn from it right? So I bought my first perused new car 11 days ago. It has 30 day back guarantee on it. Itâ€™s a 2020 Mitsubishi Outlander with 12k miles on it. Runs great and it just got a fresh oil change. The cost of the SUV was 19k but with taxes and paying $2300 for my warranty as well as $999 for a 4K camera the price went up to 24k. They told me the camera was mandatory to have. Thinking back they went through the documents very quickly. They were on the computer scrolling through the documents and just telling me this is just blah blah blah and GAP insurance. Can you believe my GAP insurance cost $945? 

First off I read the papers to the best of my ability and signed each document. Rule number one before going to a dealership get pre approved for credit. I have a pretty good credit score. 756 credit score and a 777 FICO score. I listened to everything the dealership told me they told me because I donâ€™t have much credit they only found one company to finance my vehicle. I now have a 9.45 APR at 84 months.

What I'm not clear on is how bond funds are weighted. I have money invested in BND, which is Vanguard's fund that is based on the aggregate bond index. It doesn't seem to me that market cap would be the logical method of indexing their investments in bonds, because the US government doesn't have a market cap in the same way that a publicly traded company does. It doesn't seem like you'd want to use debt outstanding either because that would mean you'd be sort of chasing risky investments if you are investing more into organizations with the greatest amount of debt outstanding.

Vanguard BND is Vanguard's US Bond Fund. Vanguard owns a ton of bonds on behalf of their investors. Every month the fund pays its investors a dividend, but I'm curious about how they decide the size of the dividend.

On the bonds they hold, they are receiving coupon payments and occasionally the principal is returned to them. They have to make a decision about how much (if any) of the coupon payments should be reinvested. They also have to decide if they want to pay any of the principal back to investors. 

I assume they reinvest all of the principal and maybe reinvest some of the interest to grow the total amount of holdings/maintain the allocation goals of the fund. Does anyone know what percentage of the interest received is paid out to investors and how they decide how much to pay out?

So like the title says.

5.875 30 year fixed in 2005 when we bought the home.  
We refinanced to a 30 year, 4.1 in 2012, saving us something like 300 a month.

We have been in the house 15 years to so keep up with a 30 year fixed from the time we initially bought the house in 2005, should we refinance to a lower rate 15 year, or just pay more per month to get us ""back on track"" to a 15 year plan with our current loan?

So we have a town-home we've had for 15 years. The larger unit town-home next door is gonna be for sale and we have a chance to buy it for a decent price without a realtor.   (Think Market Value minus the 30 grand or so the guy would lose to the realtor, plus some allowances for carpet, paint etc.) 

We live in an expensive city in a warm southern state, in an expensive neighborhood where the home prices are always ridiculous.  Single family homes in the area we want to be in are out of our reach right now, but might not be in 5 years if we save aggressively.  The next door town home has several things we DO want--a two car garage vs one, a larger yard, more closet space etc--but it is still a town home and I think I will eventually want a single family home.

kpnk64,Feed_Me_No_Lies,"Confusion on how to calculate a ""Break even point"" with a refi that will actually ""cost"" 120 dollars more a month. (Refinancing 23 yr. left on 4.1 30 yr to a 15 yr. 2.1)

Ok. So some background info:    

Bought townhome in 2005 right before the crash.  30 year fixed, 5.875 interest. (Normal at the time.)   
Refinanced under the harp program in 2012--when the place was worth mothing-- to a 30 year 4.1.  Monthly payment went down of course.    

We *were* going to make extra payments to keep on schedule with the original 30 year loan timeframe. Didn't happen. So we have technically 23 years left on the refinanced 30 year at 4.1  

I can now get a refi to a 15 year for 2.1 because interest rates are so low, with roughly $3,800 closing costs.  This would put us right back on schedule (we've been in the house 15 years), but it *would* have a slightly higher payment of about 120 dollars per month because of the shorter timeframe.  Obviously, even thought monthly cost is higher, a *great deal* more would be going toward principal a month because of the 15 year timeframe.    

However, we don't want to be here for 15 years.  Maybe 5 max? We have kiddos now and townhome is feeling small. We are trying to save tons of cash for a new house. (50 k per year for 4-5 years...we live in an expensive area.) However, we *may* keep this house as a rental as we can get good cash for it per month, and it would make a great long term investment/potential in-law home in the future.   

*But what we are trying to figure out is the break even point and if a refi is worth it since we don't plan on being here more than 5 years as our primary residence.*    

**So, with a new mortgage that would be more a month but paying down debt faster, how do I calculate break even?**   

I entered all the info in a refinance calculator and it says ""-31 months"" to break even.""  Obviously, they are expressing months negatively since the mortgage is higher per month, but can I also use this number to calculate break even? I am assuming that timeframe (not quite 3 years) is the amount if time to make up the 3,800 dollars in closing costs with saved interest?   

Current: 190,000 left on loan  
23 years left  
Principal Amount per month:458  
Interest 652  
Escrow 412  

Refi  
Principal Amount per month: 898 (A big difference of course!)   
Interest 332 (A big difference of course!)  
Escrow 412??  (Would this rise since the home is being ""resold?""  Do my property taxes change here? State of FL.)  

Anyway, obviously a refi is the better *long-term option* as it would save something like 84k over the life over the 23 years left on the original, but with a 5 year time span here, we are just trying to see whether it is worth it to refi. Also, I assume if I keep it as a rental, it is worth the re-fi to have someone else pay down our debt faster. I don't think the 120 a month negatively impacts us that much in a rental situation. 

Anyway, thoughts are greatly appreciated here! If I can confidently say ""not quite 3 years is the break even"", then I feel better. If it is shorter, then great but if it is longer, I need to understand how to calculate that as well.",,,,,

Like the title says: The 30 year would lower our current mortgage about 500 bucks.  The refi to a 15 would raise it about 150, but it would shave 8 years off the mortgage as it was reset to a 30 in 2012 under the HARP refi program after the recession.

We are saving cash the next few years to buy a bigger place. (Break even on the refi and have a couple years of the savings each month thrown together with a large part we've been waving for awhile.)  

Would y'all do a 30 year to lower the payment and do something else with the cash, or would you go toward the 15 to pay off the debit faster? If we were going to be in the house for 15 more years the 15 year note is the clear winner.

So I understand the general principal of ""If you can make more money investing somewhere else than your mortgage and are comfortable with it, do that"", but I wanted your opinions.  (43 years old, 2 kids, no other debt, plenty of retirement savings.) 

189,000 left on a townhome currently worth about 370,000.  

**Currently a 30 year refi at 3.0 would drop our monthly payment 279 a month.  
A 15 year at 2.5 would raise it 185 a month.**

Difference between the two mortgage types is 465 a month. (Rounded to 500 for investing down below.) 

Our plan is so save for 2-5 years more, and have a fat down payment on a house we really want. We have 100k in a high interest savings account as a start.  (We are in a townhome and want a house for our kids, but we need to save more to be able to have an affordable mortgage in our area. Hence the savings.  We think we can save 50 grand a year from our businesses, hence the 2-4 year savings goal we've set to be able to get a house we really want in a few years.)  

MAIN SCENARIOS: 
I've looked at amortization tables, and after two years, we would have 14 more grand paid off on principal with the 15 year.

*However,* even if we just saved the 500 a month from the 30 year refi into a regular savings account, we would have 12 grand at the end of that same two years in our pockets/savings acount/investment/529 etc, a roughly 2,000 difference that the 30 year ""Costs us"" over the same time as the 15. 

I would most likely invest in the market in a target fund or total stock market fund or another vehicle as the amount over the few years we will be in the house won't really amount to much of a dent in the savings goals for the new house over the next few years, so that 12 grand we save on the 30 would be something like 13 grand assuming a 5 percent return.  I understand that's not guaranteed.  

Most of our house savings would come from our businesses and I understand that in general, you don't put money in the market you will need in the next 5 years. This extra fund would just be additional long term investing more than likely. I know statistically stock market is an average about 7 percent year to year with wild fluctuations in any year.

Break even on these refis is about 14 months BTW. 

I think the 30 year gives us both more option for financial growth and more flexibility if we decided to rent this house later or whatever.

I guess I am asking...what would YOU guys do here? (Wanting to only be in a place for 2-4 years and wanting to take advantage of these low interest rates.)",,,,,

I haven't bought a new car in 20 years as I kept one for 16 years and this old model current one for almost 5.  Well, my car (the current family car) is having troubles and really does need to be replaced. (It's a 2006 BTW.) Usually, I'd be working and have some of my own income to contribute and I'd probabally buy my car myself since we have always each owned our vehicles personally.  

There is a bit of confusion and more than a little misplaced male pride in my post as I find myself in a situation I've never been in before. My husband is doing really well right now, so any cash for a car is just from what he has earned as I have no personal savings...for the first time in my life.

Hey there. So we have 25k cash sitting doing NOTHING in a savings account.  This is earmarked for a new car. I will probabally buy a used car costing around that or a new suv-type vehicle that is 35k or so and keep it for many years. I'm currently driving a 2006 suv that is breaking down and I need an SUV type vehicle for my family car.

I am starting to think it would be a better long-term play to take the 25k (or most of it) and put it in the market long-term in vanguard index total stock market where it will make (on average but not guaranteed) more than the loan percentage on a new or used car is. 

I did this with my mortgage: We refinanced back to a 30 instead of a 15  and took the extra amount we would be paying a month on the 15 (about 500 a month) and I dump it into the market for long-term growth.  I do this monthly and automatically as if our mortgage really is a 15 year and we ""have"" to pay that extra.  Meanwhile, I get the growth of 500 dollars that is (on average but not guaranteed), much better than my 3.00 percent mortgage. 

Is there any good reason not to do this with a car? Seems like I am missing out on a lot of interest compounding if I take that cash and dump it right into a depreciating asset, but I wanted to get your opinions. 

Some additional details:
1. Income in our family is fine, and if we needed more cash, we have plenty we can extract from one of our two business, or plenty of non-retirement stock we could get at if we needed.  

2.  That cash for the car has been sitting there for years doing nothing and I don't feel good about that. I love compounding.  (It was an Old account from spouse, they felt more comfortable with it sitting there years ago etc.) That's my primary motivation for asking the question.  

3.  We have 100k cash sitting in an account doing nothing for a down payment on a home in a few years. I hate that this money is ""doing nothing"" while we decide on where we can live in the next few years, so that's more motivation for me to ""make this car money work for me."" I know you aren't' supposed to throw money in the market you are gonna need in the next  years.  

Anyway, bah blah blah. I understand if we had no other cash or needed this 25k for an emergency fund I wouldn't put i tin the market. But, since this is ""Car money"" anyway, I am trying to see the best route here.

Looking at a Brand new (we will keep it for 15 years), 7-seat Family Crossover SUV for 45 k to replace an SUV that is 15 years old. 

I have  25k cash earmarked for a car, and was considering financing a small loan for the 20k balance  though we could buy it outright no problem. The question is this: Because We will be looking for a new home in the next year or so, would it be more attractive to our potential mortgage lender for us to have a small loan and therefore more cash to put down on the house, or is more attractive to them for us to have less cash to put down, but no small car loan?  (The houses will be in the 700k range we are looking at and we will be putting 20-25 percent down.) 

We have no other debt other than our current mortgage. I know about DTI ratios and whatnot, but I don't know if we should take the loan if we didn't need to. and how this is viewed by lenders.

Thanks in advance...I hope it made sense! :)",,,,,
qaeecb,Feed_Me_No_Lies,"With home prices having skyrocketed and interest rates having dropped, is the old saying that you should ""buy a home no more than 3x's your yearly income"" even valid anymore?

So I live in a high cost of living area, and with interest rates being what they are and the market being what it is, it would be almost impossible to find anything for my growing family in the area we want to be that comes even close to only three times our annual incomes if we want to stay in our current radius.

We are looking at two houses to get out of our townhome we've been in for 15 years. We have about two years of income in equity in it that we will use for a new house.

Here's the thing: Even The ""cheaper"" house options we are looking at are still 4.7 times our yearly incomes in our city. You can get cheaper, but they are in areas we have no desire to live in either do to school districts, commute time etc.

The one that is more expensive--but we would put more cash down on to ensure a DTI under 36--is 7.3 times our annual income.

We have no other loan obligations except our current mortgage, so we are in good shape there, and we have several years of income saved up in cash for down payment of 25-30 percent on either home, but the total home prices in my area are simply MUCH more expensive than 3 times our yearly income.

So is this old rule even valid anymore? Or is the answer ""move to a cheaper neighborhood farther out"" the correct one here? Again, we would pay enough cash on any home we got into so that we wouldn't be over-mortgaged, but I am really wondering about this rule and if it still applies.",,,,,
qaquaq,Feed_Me_No_Lies,"Have any of you rented a property that was only profitable in a small way year to year but did it long term to have someone else pay down the note? Is it worth it?

So.  Aside form the question of ""Do you want to be a landlord?"", I am wrestling with on whether or not to keeping our townhome as a rental property long-term since it will only generate 5-8 k of profit a year on 26-28k of rent depending on various factors of maintenance and whether or not it takes one month or more to turnaround etc.

Stats:
Townhome Built in 2005, we are the original owners. It is our primary residence, but we are looking at a new home for our growling family.  
Our unit is one of the smallest available homes/units in a VERY high cost of living/sought planned neighborhood, so it rents nicely and quickly from what I have seen.  
We have Had it for 15 years so we rode out the financial crisis dip for a decade and a huge amount of equity just recovered post-pandemic.  
Would sell today for about 440,000 with about 190,000 being left on the mortgage.  (Recently re-fied back to a 30 year to drop the payments in case we decided to rent it out, and it would only take a year to recoup the costs of the refi.)    

So, we have Equity of 220k-240k  if we sold depending on with a realtor or not yada yada yada. 
It would rent for about 2,400 giving us about 26,400 of rental income a year with a one month turnaround. (Less if longer turnaround obviously.) 

I think long term, it's a great investment but with what is left on on the note, high association fees, lawn maintenance and everything else, even renting at the market rate of about 2,400 a month, we only have that 5-8k profit at the end of each year. 

Now, we would either put down that profit on the note, or put in a higher earning investment since the note is at 3.0 percent. 

But...is worth it? I know it would be a low maintainence property very near where my new home would be.",,,,,
srhy1r,Feed_Me_No_Lies,"New house question: 20 percent down 30 year fixed and invest the equity from current home long-term, or take the equity and roll it into the new house to lower mortgage principal?

Hey there. So here are some stats:

Current townhome (been there 17 years) is too small. We now have two young kids and need a bigger garage, an extra bedroom, more appropriate yard etc.  We refinanced our townhome about a year ago with the plans to save for 2-3 years for a house. Instead of a 15 year, we refinanced to a 30 and are taking the 500 a month that would have gone to principal with a 15 and we are investing in long-term index funds to grow more than it would on a 3.1 percent loan.  

However, an opportunity came up on a new house and we would need to make an offer by close of business...TODAY. lol. (Couple in new house is only showing this weekend and taking an offer that comes up this weekend.  They will receive multiple offers, potentially over asking. Real estate in my state is RED HOT with post-covid transplants from California and New York jacking up sale prices.) 

**NUMBERS:**
We are 45 years old, two young kids ages 3 and 5. So we will be 60 when youngest is graduating high-school/going off to college.  
Current townhome could probabally sell for $500,000. (Maybe more. Maybe QUITE a bit more as the location is PREMIUM and NO current inventory. Maybe even $600,000 but I will use the low number for estimation purposes.)   
We owe $190,000 @30 year, 3.1 (Refinanced about a year ago.)  
Potential equity in our pockets after 6 percent realtor fees assuming the above sales price: $275,000 (roughly)
**EDIT: Income is variable. Husband makes about 200-250k profit in business a year, I make 10-40k in mine.**.  

**New house:**
Asking $500,000  
We will probabally offer 510,000 to stave off other local offers but we won't play if someone from California offers 75k over asking or whatever. 

Now, We plan on being in this home to get our kids through high school (They are currently Ages 3 and 5). I don't think this is a ""forever home"", but we pan on being there for 10-15 years for sure.)

We have the current cash to put the 20 percent down without using the equity in our current townhome, but we could use the equity in our current home to lower the principal to something like $85,000. (275,000 equity from current home plus 110,000 cash savings we have for down payment.)   

So the question is: Do we want to lower the principal to something like 85,000 with that extra equity money, or should we just do the 20 percent down and finance $408,000?

*Assuming I could afford the higher mortgage monthly amount either way and that we would be approved for a higher mortgage*, what would you guys do? $275,000 equity is a lot of cash. Current loans are like 3.8 percent for 30 year (they have jumped up quite a bit.)  I am comfortable with risk and long-term investing. If we DIDN'T  use the equity to lower the new mortgage, we would definitely grow it: Vanguard index funds in a our brokerage account to sit for years and grow.   

Soo....what do ya think? Lower that new house principal by putting a lot more than 20 percent down, or grow our current house equity in vanguard index funds long-term to be used for things like college, braces, or whatever?  

So other things to consider: We both own our own businesses, but it is true that good fortune can change and the great financial years we have been experiencing may change.  That makes the idea of a lower monthly payment attractive, but if we had that cash still growing in the market/savings, we could dump that in a re-fi if we needed to if our business fortunes change.  

What do ya think given our age, our kids' ages and the home prices/our savings etc?  (Maybe we put more than 20, but less than the full equity amount as another option?) Thanks in advance!!!! :)",,,,,

Hey there. Just like the title says: like so many people, I worry about the credit dings of a hard inquiry but I know that when you are applying for a refinance or a mortgage, multiple inquiries tend to get lumped into one on the credit report because they know you are shopping for a mortgage.

tgckp3,Feed_Me_No_Lies,"Byung a home that needs renovation. Will need to live in the current place for several months while the rennos are done. Need creative ways to get equity out of our of current or new.

So. We have a townhome as our primary with about 250-275k equity in it.  (Owe 190, market value of about 500 or more depending on several factors.)  

We are purchasing a new home ($530,000 3.49 fixed 20 percent down).  

We got approval for the new lender for both mortgages, so we did not have to put a contingency down that we needed to sell our current home.  So we will live here while new home is being renovated. (Double mortgage for 6 months sucks, but pales in comparison to having to move twice or live in a construction one in the new house.) 

We were/are considering renting out our current townhome, but that is looking less and less attractive due to the need/desire for access to equity, and the fact that it is an expensive, class a property and the profit margin wouldn't be that great. If we kept it for renting, it would be for LONG term.  

We have the cash to close on new house no problem.  HOWEVER, the house needs some major renovations: 100-200k worth. (It's a beautiful mid-century modern that has had half a restore. We will need to do full with electrical upgrades etc. That spirals into new kitchen cabinets, drywall etc.  We probabally have all that covered--without selling the current home--except for about 75 grand or so.   

My Current lender--my conservative credit union-- says they will not do a heloc on the current property because it will be an investment property at time of closing on the new house. I have not talked to other lenders yet to see if they will. 

I have heard after I close on the new house, I can do a heloc on IT since I will have put 20 percent down. 

But aren't HELOCS subject to Debit to income ratios in the same way as first mortgages? If so, we are already mortgaged to the hilt with the current and the new after closing. So, I don't even know if a heloc is an option. (We are two business owbers, so getting full approval on the new mortgage was kind of hell since I had to submit so much documentation and the industry is really setup for regular w2 employees.) 

Are there other ways besides a heloc or selling?  Construction loans etc?

I know we could sell this place, rent it back for a few months from new owners--probabally not as many as 6--and have all the quity we needed, but baring that, what options do y'all see here for me?  

ANY help would be appreciated!! :)",,,,,

House is a 5br/3ba/2kitchen, 2400sqft in NJ. It appraised for $663k when I bought it in 2022. My mortgage was $305k. Estimates Iâ€™m seeing online including Zillow are between $680-$733k right now. So figure I have $300-400k in equity. Iâ€™d like to add bedrooms and maybe an office to my large but unfinished attic but just canâ€™t afford to drop that cash right now. 

We have 1yo twins and just found out my wife is pregnant. My mom lives on the first floor of the house and my South African MIL spends half the year living with us and the other half in South Africa but that bedroom is also used when my brother and his family come to visit when sheâ€™s not here. 

Upstairs has 3 bedrooms, one is the nursery for the babies, the other is the master bedroom, and the third is the guest room/home office and I typically sleep in there. We have a fully functional gym in the garage but I anticipate Iâ€™ll have to move things around and make that an office when the new baby comes. 

What should I be considering? Im 30M, income at my new job is $185k/yr, plus 20% bonus ($37k). Company also offers a 10% 401k match  ($18,500) that I intend to take advantage of plus some smaller stipends. Also getting a $10k sign on bonus in December.

Im middle-manager who's trying to find a new white collar job for office experience, and have been applying to banks, hospitals, and corporate positions. I'm limited by my lack of college degree, I plan on going to college later, but right now I'm trying to find entry-level positions at these places to get my foot in the door.

I haven't received any offers yet, and my family is pushing for me to get a job at a grocery store, gas station, or other similar jobs with openings right now. In my area, the governor is likely to close down all non-essential businesses for awhile, and I'm sure many who become affected with layoffs/closings will flood to those job openings once it happens. 

I have a few months savings, and I was told by a mentor to never sacrifice your career path for job security if you can help it.

-Ill likely be eligible for unemployment if I get laid off

I've was let go from my job a few days ago, and I was wondering if you have some financial advice for what I should be doing, if some larger expenses I've been considering make sense, and if you have any advice in general for handling a layoff? 

**Assets**: 

Savings: $17,500 (7 months of my living expenses)

Unemployment: I just filed for unemployment so I dont know for sure, but it estimates out around $187-263 a week after taxes. I'm not sure how to apply for the additional $600 a week as part of the CARES Act ($450 after taxes), or if I'll be eligible for it. 

**Living Expenses**: $2,500 a month. I not to have many non-essential expenses. I'm evaluating my bank statements, but right now there's not too much I can cut out except maybe changing my health insurance.

I wanted to get your thoughts on these additional expenses that I'm debating on that would come out of the $17,500:

-A used car ($6000-8000 or 3-4 months of living expenses): My car was totaled a week before everything shutdown in my state. It's limiting to my job search without one, but I realize how important having money now is. I have friends who could drive me to interviews, but I'd need to see what public transportation is still open for more reliable transportation. 

-Bicycle repairs ($300-400 or around a quarter of a month of living expenses): I have an old bike from a few years ago which probably needs a lot of work. Fixing it would be able to get me further/quicker to places.

-A laptop (estimated cost: $1800 or 1 month of living expenses): I have a computer, but it's old and freezes up/dies quite often which makes applying for jobs or doing anything with it frustrating. I wanted this for use as a day planner, to apply for jobs faster, and take courses online for certificates. 

-College education: I've wanted to go to college for a long time, but my meetings with school financial advisers had to be postponed. I have no idea what financial aid I'd get, but it seems that it would be $15,000-$20,000 a year paying out of pocket if I went full time, and I'd be going part time. I'd mostly be concerned about needing money for living expenses, so I dont know how I'd be able to go to school without also working full time. 

-Health insurance: It's expensive relative to my financial information, but I had few options. I qualify now to change my health insurance policy, so I can get one that's cheaper (maybe down to $90-$110 a month, but it wont cover much, and itd be more for if I didnt want to pay more than 20k in an emergency).

1. What is your advice/thoughts for my finances?

2. Do you have any advice about how to best handle this situation financially/productively while staying sane and healthy? 

3. I worked as an office manager for the last year and a half, and have almost two years of retail experience on top of that. I don't have a degree, and I'm fairly early into my career. I'm looking for office/administrative work in a hospital/bank/office setting. I understand the lack of degree may hurt, and with the ongoing situation, I may have to take a different job down the line.

gzofvv,FinancialFlora,"How can you improve your financial health and credit score in this situation?

Hi, I'm in my mid-twenties and I'm looking to improve my financial health and credit score as much as possible?

I currently net about $2,000 a month after taxes, and have a 10 month emergency fund in my savings account at a credit union (which is needed for me with the ongoing financial climate). 

I have two credit cards, one from a couple years ago, and the other I got just a few weeks ago. The first one has a small limit and the second one is a bit larger. They don't have rewards, but I'm using them up to 25% of their limit each month for everyday expenses to build my credit, and they're set to automatic full-balance payments. 

I've never had student loans, or any other type of loans. I really want a shining credit score for future loans and apartments, and I'm planning on going to college in about six months. The bank I got my second credit card from said I already had a pretty good credit score from the first credit card line being open for the last few years, even though I never used it, so I was able to qualify for the """"premium"""" card with no annual fees. 

**Questions**

My emergency fund is just sitting in my savings account. Should I move it to a different type of account, like a money-market account? 

How much can I increase my credit score in the next six to eight months through responsibly utilizing my credit cards, and how long will it take to get a great score overall (800+)? 

How long should I wait before opening another credit card to increase my credit score (maybe one with rewards) if I just opened a card a few weeks ago, and plan on having a credit check for a new apartment in six to eight months?

Besides cutting down on monthly expenses, and following the Prime Directive on this subreddit, is there any advice you have for me to improve my financial health and build good credit?",,,,,
gzpn3y,FinancialFlora,"Questions about credit utilization and applying for more cards?

Currently I keep my credit cards at 25% of their total line of credit each month and pay in full automatically when the balance is generated. Is 25% a good amount, or should I got higher/lower to increase the credit I get each month? 

Now I know going over 30% utilization will negatively impact my score, but will paying off my utilization multiple times in the month increase it? My bank teller said that the statement is only generated once, so if I were to use 25%, pay it off, then use 25% again within the month it'd make no difference in increasing my score.

Lastly, I currently have a credit card from a bank that I never use, and I'm looking to increase my limits. I recently got a credit card from my regular bank with a much higher limit, and they did a hard pull to check my score. Could the first bank use the same pull to review increasing my limits, or would they have to conduct another pull?",,,,,
i87wqa,FinancialFlora,"Which of these supplementary insurance plans are actually worth the cost in this situation?

I'm in my mid-twenties and started my first job that's offering semi-decent health insurance, but its also offering a lot more. Besides your basic medical, dental, and eye-care, which of these insurance plans make sense financially? 

Background: I've always had weird health conditions and an irregular heart, nothing known to be life threatening though. I'm in okayish shape, but I'm mostly on my own financially, I live month to month and any kind of accident that'd put me out of work would eliminate my income entirely. I work an office job that I could likely work mostly if not completely remote if needed.

**All offered insurance types cost about $10-12 dollars each per month**

*Short-term disability: This one is the one I question most. My work already provides free long-term disability, and this one requires me to be working atleast part-time and gives me the equivalent of about 55% of my weekly gross income each week. I need to have the disability for atleast 8 days before it starts to pay out. 

*Critical illness: Pays out a maximum of $13,000 for one-time diagnoses of large-scale health issues like terminal cancer, strokes, or heart attacks. Only 25% of that amount for things like brain tumors and heart surgery. 

*Accident insurance: I also must still be working atleast part-time for this to pay out, and pays pretty well for things like surgical fracturs and dislocations (around $5,000) burns (around $9,000) and but not much for things like days spent in the ICU ($400 a day).

With everything, I'd probably be going to end up paying around $120 a month or about 6-7% of my net income. Which do you think is worth it?",,,,,

I suck at negotiating, and find myself continually taken advantage of, and Im trying to learn how you build good negotiating skills?

I told a friend about trying to work on my skills at negotiating and being treated fairly at work (as I'm often too nice and get taken advantage of from not advocating for myself properly). I was given a few seasons of the show ""Pawn stars"" and books on negotiating and people skills with others, but many of them seem too focused on ""mind hacks"".

A lot of these books heavily rely on these social engineering tactics that the authors stress heavily affects negotiation and communication with other people: mirroring their body language, repeating the last few words of others sentences in the form of a question, talking like a therapist (""it seems like *blank* is important to you and you're *insert feeling* about *insert current circumstances*) and wait for them to elaborate with more information that might help the negotiation, being overly apologetic when you can't do something, etc. 

While in fairness, most of these tactics are in theory just designed to get the other person to reveal more information by getting them to elaborate on their feelings and wants to help the negotiation, I'm having trouble identifying which of these tactics are useful and which are real or would actually make things worse.

I come from a financially illiterate family, and learning any information about credit card balances and payments (and their impact on my credit score) has been like pulling teeth with my bank and anyone else. My credit card is setup for automatic payments, but it only takes out the minimum amount due when it makes the automatic payments. Will this hurt my score because the payments aren't for the full amount?

I am beyond confused. I know its a myth that having a balance carry over into the next month is good for your credit score, but some people at my bank still seem to believe it. I try to keep my credit card balance utilization below 20% each month, but unless I pay it off manually, the automatic payment only takes the minimum amount due instead of the full balance. 

I was told the reason is that its okay to keep an amount on my balance to carry over into the next months billing cycle, in fact it's good for my credit score to show utilization, by make bank. Is this true, or should I fight to have my automatic payments pay the full balance of my card? 

**Bonus question to make a lady's day** Can I use above 20-30% utilization on my credit card without negatively impacting my credit score, as long as I get it down to 20-30% before the end of the month?

Hello and Merry Christmas to you all.

I have two federal student loans at 2.875%, one for approximately 26k and one for 37k, for a total of 63k in federal student loan debt.

Thanks to my relatively comfortable living situation (living with parents) and a relatively stable job, I could save up enough money in the next twelve months to totally pay off the 63k at once.

l9gsuj,fizzle63,"Recently paid off auto loan (in Florida), do I need to do anything to get a clear title?

Last week I paid off my auto loan with a major auto financer.  I'm in Florida.  Do I need to do anything else, like write to the lender for a satisfaction of lien?  From what I understand, Florida does electronic titles now so I really won't get any notice of anything, no mail, no actual title, etc.?  If that's the case, how will I know the title is clear?

I realize this is a very basic question but I'm relatively young and have never paid off an auto loan before, and I don't want to tell any of my friends about it since it might be seen as showing off.",,,,,

This is a very basic question but I can't seem to crunch the numbers correctly, perhaps I'm slow.  I wanted to put $3k into VTSAX but I don't have $3k, I only had $1100 to spare.  So I bought five shares of the ETF equivalent (VTI) instead.

Am I giving up any potential gains?  I guess I'll have to pay the fees (expense ratio?) and short term capital gains when I sell the VTI to roll into VTSAX (I'm in the 22% federal bracket).

m6bk5x,fizzle63,"Low income, low tax, low expenses lifestyle -- what is the best conservative wealth retention plan in this situation?

Hypothetically speaking, let's say an individual had a post-tax net income of $39,000 per annum.  Living expenses at most are $20,000 per annum, leaving approximately $19,000 in cash per year to save, invest, etc.

Let's also say this person does have one debt, a home equity loan from way back, with a remaining $60,000 balance at 3.99%.  Total equity in the property still exceeds $200,000 at the moment.

m6lfob,fizzle63,"Paying off a low interest partially subsidized student loan early?

Hi everyone!

I have a student loan composed of two parts, a federal unsubsidized loan and a federal subsidized loan.  Both have a nominal interest rate of 2.875%, but the federal government pays the interest on the subsidized portion, leaving the total loan with an effective interest rate of ~1.5% (the unsubsidized portion is slightly larger.)

I have been experimenting with paying *only* the unsubsidized, interest-accruing, portion while on forbearance and it's been working as planned, paying down that amount nicely.

But when the full repayment kicks back in later this year, what should I do?  I could afford to pay more, but what's the call on an effective interest rate of 1.5%?  (I won't be allowed to pay only the unsubsidized portion anymore when the forbearance ends.)",,,,,

So, in a situation like this, wouldn't it make sense just to keep the car, like I'm stuck with it?  It doesn't take up too much space and the tag/insurance costs aren't that much.  The upkeep isn't that much going forward either now that most of the major stuff has been done.",,,,,
