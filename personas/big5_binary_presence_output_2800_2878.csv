125jwj1,jaytea86,"Interest rates may have put a home out of our reach for now, where to go from here?

Income $35k a year. Household is me and my disabled wife, no kids. $40k in savings. Absolutely no debt. We own a 1967 mobile home that probably isn't worth 5 figures. Lot rent is $550. We own our 2007 vehicle outright and may only have a couple of years left if we're lucky. 6% of my income is going into my 401k.

The plan for this year was to buy a home, we've been accepted into a land trust program that allows low income people like ourselves get into the housing market by selling the homes at a reduced price while maintaining ownership of the land. When you sell the house, you sell it for a reduced price to ""pay it forwards"".

However with the sharp raise in interest rates, even these homes are barely within our budget, so for now we're staying put and continuing to save while I work on becoming a citizen (currently legal resident), this has to be done before we can get a mortgage.

We've been approved for a loan amount of $123k @ 7.375% (as of November of last year) keeping the total monthly payment at or below $1100 with taxes and insurance. Although we live well below our means and would want to keep that in the range of $800-$900 that would put us at a home for around $100k which isn't really a thing right now.

In the meantime, I don't know what to do with money that's just sat earning $100 a month. I 100% won't need any of the money for the next 3 months, but I wouldn't want to lock up all of it for any longer than that. I'm open to locking some of that money up for a longer period of time, maybe on a annual basis, but would want to make sure that we had enough to jump on a home if the right one showed up.

I been a little foolish with risky investments and am ashamed that I've lost $2000 doing that. So it's time to get serious with no or very low risk investments.

Right now I can lock up about $30k for a few months, $10k-$15k I could lock up for a year.

Thanks for taking the time!

162izop,jaytea86,"MiL has just realized she'll never be able to retire. Is it too late for her or is there some hope?

Visiting the MiL (61) today and she was all excited that she'll be able to apply for retirement benefits in November. While I was there I looked up some information and it seems that she'll only get $680 a month and would only be able to earn up to $17k a year and then SS will start dropping that amount.

She earns $14.80-$17 an hour depending what type of work she's doing at her place of employment. But essentially her biweekly paycheck comes in around $1450 net. She lives paycheck to paycheck, so the idea that she would be able to live with anything less than this is impossible.

She did look into section 8 however they base what you pay at 30% of your income which is about what she's already paying for her apartment.

She's massively in debt, somewhere between $20k-$40k. Half is medical the rest is a car loan and credit cards. She's applied for bankruptcy which she expects to take care of everything but her car loan ($13k left on it at 4.7%).

She's thought about selling the car and buying something cheaper. But I'm pretty sure what's left on the loan is more than what the car is worth so she'd still owe and not have anything to buy a new car. It also seems pointless to me because a $3k-$5k car is going to break down at some point and she'll have no money to fix it. She must have a reliable car for her job as it's not on a bus route and she is also obese and in poor health.

The plan I have set out for her is to take $250 out of every paycheck and put it in a roth IRA. That would max it out every year. Doing this would mean by the time she reaches 67 she'll be able to take full retirement benefits in SSI of $1250 and will have contributed $33k to her roth ira which would hopefully be around $45k by the time she would need to draw from it.

She might not be able to fully retire at 67, but maybe at least cut back on working 50 hours a week.

_x000D_  
The reason I ask if this is rich persons game is that I've heard a few people talk about maxing this account out and never using the money for medical, you'd pay cash for that, because once you pull it out, you can't put anymore back in till the next year.

17qhz0k,jaytea86,"Stopping all 401k contributions and maxing out Roth IRA and HSA. Am I doing the right thing?

I'm 36 and was contributing 6% of my $35k income into a 401k. This year for the first time I maxed out a Roth IRA after learning about them. My employer doesn't match any 401k contributions.

My understanding is that a Roth IRA takes priority over a 401k because you'll be able to withdraw all the money (including money made through investing) tax free. 

I've recently switched to full time and am now earning $45k. I did this primarily to get health insurance as the state won't cover me anymore because my income is too high.

With the insurance came a HSA. I plan to max it out in the last 3-4 paychecks of this year. This will leave my paycheck decimated, but that's ok, I have money to cover me till the end of the year.

I plan on using my HSA as an investment account, and I intend never to touch the money until I retire.

If I put $3500 into my Roth IRA and $3,850 into my HSA, that's $7,350 a year.

This works out to be about 15% our household income between me and my wife (she earns $500 a month on SSdI).

We're behind on retirement I believe. 401k has $7.5k in it and $3500 in my Roth IRA.

At the very start of next year, I'll have the same in the 401k, but double in the Roth IRA, and a 1 year maxed out HSA. \~$17k

Is 15% going forwards enough to retire in my mid 60s comfortably? Or should I try and push that higher? If so what kind of % should I be shooting for?

With a maxed out HSA and Roth IRA, Should I start contributing to my 401k if I need to increase that %? Or should I have my wife open a Roth IRA? Can she even do that with SSdI income? I'm not sure it's considered ""earned income""?

Any other advice is welcome.

I'm new to HSA, but my understanding is that its use is to save for medical expenses tax free, and then to spend them on medical expenses also tax free. However, you can pay cash for medical stuff and then save your paperwork for decades and use receipts to draw the money out tax free whenever you want (for me, retirement).

For the first time in my life I have insurance through my employer, before then I was getting it through the state.

It came with a HSA which I maxed out in my last 3 paychecks of the year.

I wanted to invest all of it on a target date fund but Optum Bank requires $2k to remain outside of my investment accounts. I'm also having lots of issues with Optum, dollar amounts can differ when I log in (for example they're saying my ""total funds"" are $2.6k, then tell me my contributions for the year are $3850 with $575 invested), pretty sure that was different an hour ago when I logged in, but either way, math.

Also, I have it set so that when the threshold of $2k is activated, the rest is sent to my mutual funds which isn't happening.

But mainly the $2k sat doing nothing bothers me. I've read elsewhere on here that other financial institutions that hold HSA funds allow you to invest it all, however this is the place that my employer defaults to, so I'm not sure how I'd make that change, even if I can at all.",Yes,Yes,No,No,Yes

However, a few months ago she was garnished again by the same company for $19. And now it happened again. She's been trying to contact the company but they're playing phonetag. Any idea why this would be happening? Surely they wouldn't get a court order to garnish just $19?

kyf0zn,jaytea86,"I have just been gifted $8k and will be gifted another $8k in a few months. I'm in a low income household, how should I handle this?

Financially 2020 was actually one of the best years me (35m) and my wife (32F) have had. The small amount of money I had in crypto currency has now just hit 4 figures, all the stimuli went straight into savings accounts to build a more substantial emergency fund, and I also got a new job which increased our income to about $30k a year.

I work part time, about 33 hours a week. This is because my wife is disabled and that extra day off a week helps me handle her needs and stops me from getting burnt out. Because of this I'm very efficient with money. We squeeze as much as we can out of credit card rewards and have money in some niche high interest accounts. The rest is in a 0.5% interest savings account.

My wife receives social security income and we're both on state (MN) medical because of our low income.

We own a crappy mobile home, so no mortgage, but pay $450 to rent the land it's sat on. It wouldn't be cost effective to move it.

$8k showed up in my account yesterday. After much confusion I spoke to my Dad who lives in another country and turns out he sold a property I lived in as a kid and wanted to send me and my brother $16k each, but for tax reasons he's going to send the rest after April (which is when the new tax year starts in his home country).

So I'm a little lost here. The first thing is, what should I do with the money? Our main goal in life is to actually have a house, and to stop paying to rent land for the rest of our lives. However, with our low income, I feel like we would need a substantial amount of money to put down on the house right away to keep the mortgage low so we could afford it, and to even get one at all with just earning $30k a year. If this is the case, what should I do with the money I have now, and additional money I'll save until it's time to buy a home?

The second things is, currently we now have over $20k between our savings and checking account, which is almost 5 times more than what we had at the start of year when we last declared our assets for the annual reviews for both our medial and her SSI. How likely is it that we'll lose all 3 of those things? Obviously no one here will be able to answer exactly, and this is something I'll have to deal with when it comes to it, but it would be nice to have a heads up so I can start thinking about alternatives.

Lastly, taxes. Will have have to pay taxes on these to $8k gifts? Do I need to declare this money at all?

I've had the money sat in a savings account for 3 months waiting for a $100 bonus to come through for depositing the money with them. I've got that bonus now so I'm ready to invest about $10-$12k of it for the next 3 to 5 years, leaving 5k in there as an emergency fund.

It can not be locked up for more than a year at a time. However I hope to add more and more to it as time goes on.

I've read that a three-fund portfolio is also out because, again, because it's such a short period of time. As much as I'd like to have this money make money, the goal is to stay above inflation, as opposed to risk losing it.

Me and my wife are currently living in a mobile home that, when new, man had not even walked on the moon yet. It would sell for very little, perhaps may even have to give it away, although I keep everything functional and it's structurally fine, it needs cosmetic work done on every visible surface.

We own it outright, however we rent the land for close to $500 a month. We're low income, 30k a year.

There's an organization that sells homes for $30k-$40k below market value and you rent the land from them for $35 a month for low income peeps. When you sell the home, you'll sell it for it's original market price plus 25% of the increase in value of property (you pass on the savings you got when you initially bought it).

To me, it seems like the only way we can become true homeowners, as getting a decent house in a safe area without this program, we'd be looking at $150k minimum, on that, monthly mortgage payments would be too much. But a home for 110k would be manageable.

p2ai1v,jaytea86,"Assistance / programs for people with low income but high assets?

Right off the bat I will say I've posted numerous times in PF in the last few weeks, so if people reading this are reading the same facts, figures and story I apologize and appreciate your time.

13 years ago when me and my wife got married she lost a lot of assistance. Food stamps and supplementary security income were the two biggies, this was because I had money in the bank, a small emergency fund is enough make you ineligible for almost all these assistance programs. Because she was working at the time (now made redundant), she was able to receive SSDI which she will be eligible to receive for the rest of her life regardless of our assets.

I work 32 hours at a rate of pay that would make Bernie Sanders content. My wife is disabled and cannot work a traditional job (if she could find a job that would suit her needs she could do a few hours a week, that's a WIP). I work 4 days a week so I can tend to her needs and not get burnt out. She gets enough SSDI so that our income is right at $30k.

We have about 25k over stocks, savings and an emergency fund etc. We are currently saving for a home.

It's become a little frustrating as the years ago by. Seeing our peers in much better financial situations than us, generally because they have a kid. It seems if you have a kid you get huge chucks of money back come tax time and other forms of assistance. And the couples that are childless even better still with them having dual incomes.

However, with a disabled adult in the house, that doesn't seem to mean anything. I can't even get my wife a free bus pass when vets can ride for free.

I work at a place that accepts food stamps and I see on the receipt how much money they have on their card and seeing hundreds of dollars on there and seeing them drive away in a 5 figure vehicle is really demoralizing.

Or lot rent went up substantially this year. And with child tax credits meaning people with kids may be getting even more of an income, I'm worried we're going to get left in the dust with raising cost of living, and it'll make it harder and harder to get our own home.

I ask him if he can just send a check. He does.

Check in hand I take it to my bank who won't accept it because it's foreign and in British Pounds.

Finally they said they'll just transfer the money and was told not to deposit the check.

I hear nothing more so I call back and they have not transferred the funds because I was already issued a check, are basically are out of ideas and told me to file an official complaint to push the issue to higher-ups. So that's what I did.

They apologized, said they'd add on an additional $100 and transfer the money. I gave them my bank details again, and again they asked for an IABN number which I learned that US banks don't use.

We received a decent amount of money in a settlement. Because of the nature of the case we don't have to pay taxes this year filling the tax form and we don't have to report that money as an income. The money has been sitting in a saving account for around 8 month with only 0.01% of interest. Now we are thinking to put that money in function and make some extra money investing and diversifying some saving accounts for emergency funds and the house. I have an investment portfolio with a small amount of money, another brokerage account buying stocks and my employer is taking care of a 401k having me putting a small amount of money. My desire is invest a good amount of money having access to it in 10 to 15 years and not to wait till the retirement age to withdraw that money. The amount of the money is 240k. 

However, I don't have a clear Idea in how to invest properly that amount of money. I have planned to open a few savings account to include a six month emergency fund account, a house down payment, a cash account, another small emergency funds account. A few people have recommended to open a Roth IRA which I am considering but not sure how it works. 

Really I want to receive advice, recommendation, inputs, etc. In how can I take care of that money and make earnings over it having access to some money in 10 to 15 years. If nothing happens in that time frame that money will be growing to the age of retirement. I am 36. 

Please, any advice and recommendation will be greatly appreciated. Thank you in advance to everyone taking some time to share knowledge and recommendations.

Greetings,

Hope everybody is doing great. I am feeling overwhelmed looking for information about how can I take care of a money that me and my wife received in a settlement. I have to be honest that I am really bad with investing and understanding everything involved in this environment. I have received some advices but I can't get the picture of what are the steps in doing this properly to get retirement early. 

I am 36 my wife is 31. Making 50k annually, no debts, renting a house with two kids. My employer is paying my 401k. We have 240k from a settlement and from that money I started investing in stocks. I have planned to open some emergency funds accounts and a house down payment account. The rest of the money will be for investing with the plan for retirement early, probably in 20 years. 21k will be in 6 month emergency fund account and we are not going to touch that money. 3k in another emergency fund if something occur and 25k for a house down payment and probably 15k for medical expenses if something happens. We will have 176k left for investing. We don't have to pay taxes of that money, thanks God.

I have been reading here and there a little bit but honestly I feel like if is more complicated than in reality is. But some of the suggestions that I have received are to open an Roth IRA, open a Brokerage account and put more money into the 401k. The 50k annually is just enough for the living expenses and I can't put more into the account. Just I want to use the settlement money wisely and let it growing over the time.  

My question is how can I do the investment. What are the steps to do this, the sequence or order in opening each one. Can we Open the Brokerage account first with 176k in 1 to 3 index funds and then, pull out the annual contribution for the Roth IRA annually? Or do we have to do the opposite?. How we are going to pay the taxes if we do this?. I know that for the Roth we have to pay taxes over the contribution. But if we take money out of the brokerage account, do we have to pay taxes over the gains, and then, pay more taxes when we add the funds to the Roth IRA?. Or just opening a brokerage account with  ETFs or index funds with 176k and let it grow maybe adding a couple of hundreds throughout the year?. 

What would be the best option to pay less taxes?. This post contain to much information. I apologise because I am still feeling overwhelmed. What I don't want to do is waste the money taking the wrong steps or taking bad decisions.

omgxac,jbpr77,"Roth IRA or brokerage account: which one is the best for this situation

Hello there,

I was looking for information about what is the best option to invest a settlement money. I wasn't considering opening a Roth IRA account because I would like to have the option to access the money before 59 1/2. During the searching process I have been feeling  paralysis analysis, but is time to do something to take the money out of the saving account. I thought to invest the money in a property or something like that but in my area the market is unbelievably crazy and unaccessible unless someone millionaire.  Finally I have decided that would be a great idea if I open 2 Roth IRA accounts one for my wife and another one for me. This is the breakdown of our position:

37 years old income around 55k annually before taxes. Employer providing a 401k with 11.5% contribution.

I have 230k in a savings account and 11k in a brokerage account. Of this amount of money 61k would be an emergency fund including a house down payment. For this amount I am considering to open a HYSA or a safety net account with Betterment because there is less risk. Then,  180k is going to be available for investment. I had the idea to invest all of the money in a brokerage account. However, I have read that the Roth IRA is a good option because I don't have to pay taxes over that amount of money. Here is where I want to receive any advice or recommendations in how to manage this amount of money and where it should be.

I want to be hands off because of the lack of time and knowledge. I think Betterment is a great option in this case and they offer tax loss harvesting and rebalancing. But their fees are .25% plus the funds fees. However, I don't know exactly if those options are really important and necessary for a Roth IRA account or a brokerage account.

Another option that I heard is a Target day fund with Fidelity. not sure what exactly is this and how works but in my understanding this works alone
 and it will be rebalanced over the time. 

A few questions that I have. 

Â°What would be the best option for me?.  Betterment, Fidelity target day fund or another ETF or Index fund?.

Â°Would be better if I take control over the account than rely on a Robo advisor or a Target day fund?.

Â°Should I select only one or two ETF like VTI or VWO or one of the Fidelity index Funds?. 

Â°How about the 3 funds portfolio?

One more thing, I promise. Let's say that I put 100k over the time in both Roth IRA accounts, and take the rest of the money (80k) into a brokerage account, would be that a good approach, or it's better if I take all the money to the Roth IRA account?. 

Â°Is there another investment vehicle other than Retirement account, brokerage account or HYSA  account that I can consider to let the money grow over the time?.

I apologize for this long tread and analysis paralysis. But I believe that all of you have the experience, expertise understanding and patience to help other people succed in the life and I really appreciate that. Thanks in advance!!.;",Yes,Yes,No,Yes,Yes

Hello there,

Last year found and article explaining why the investor shouldn't rebalance a portfolio. Also found another article explaining an example of one person that passed away leaving an investment account with a great amount of money. That person after she or he opened the account years ago, never went back to watch it's performance nor to take care of that account. The surprise was the amount of growth the account had over the years without rebalancing, etc.

Today I did some research and found this article talking about the same theme:
 https://www.thebalance.com/the-case-against-rebalancing-your-portfolio-4160045

 I am inexpert, but in my case that I am planning to open a Roth IRA account and a brokerage account to to put a considerable amount of money, my first choice was a Fidelity Target Date fund because is a hands off and the account does rebalance in its own over the time. The fund cost is higher compared to the rest of the ETFs just because it comes with that ""feature"". 

In reality, if rebalancing is not necessary at least the first 10 or 15 years before retirement, does make sense if I have a target day fund account that does rebalance every year?. Or even If I take control over my portfolio, do I have to rebalance once a year?. How about if I set my account with some ETfs to cut the expenses and never touch it?

I know that here are a great amount of people that are professional in this matter and have a lot of knowledge. What do you think about rebalancing?.

Hello there,

I have been in contact with Fidelity Investment support to build a plan to open two Roth IRA accounts, one joint taxable account and something like a safety net account. They gathered all of the information to build an Investment Strategy for me. The money destined as a safety net she recommended to no invest it if  the money is going to be used in less than 5 years. For the Roth IRA account and the taxable account she was asking some questions and how I would like to have the money managed. She recommended the Fidelity Target Day Fund 2045. Being honest I don't want to pay a high fees (1 to 1.5%) for them taking care of the account. So I was considering the Fidelity Freedom Index Target Day Fund because the fee is 0.012 for all of the accounts. I would like to invest in something with lower fees like the regular Index Funds, but with those I have to be more involved. 

I will like to know if some of you are dealing with these Freedom Index funds in your Roth IRA or regular taxable accounts. Do you recommend these funds?.

10vhlnh,Jcorb,"About 9k in debt, no job and no money, what is my best bet?

So, I've got about 9k in debt across credit cards (and one loan, which I'm literally on the last payment, but I can't afford). I have *literally* no money right now. I had to use loose change to put like two gallons of fuel in my car.

Clearly, not a good situation.

Right now, I've been trying to push my card payments back to the 15th. I'm past due on them all now, but I figured it gave me a hard date to decide whatever the hell I'm doing.

To my knowledge, no late payments have been reported on my credit score yet.

A friend of mine has offered the loan me enough money to relocate to live with him, and that I could stay rent-free until I lined up work and paid my debt off. I've lived with him before, and paid them back for the help they'd offered me years ago. It would be enough to at least make *one* month's payments, giving me one more month to find work, in a much more populated area.

My alternatives, I figure, are either A) I just don't make the payments, and whatever happens, happens, or B) I try and go through the process of filing bankruptcy.

Before maxing out my credit cards, my credit was actually pretty decent, I think like 804. I'm down around 640 I think, because of the cards all being maxed out. I remember, like a decade ago, missing a single credit card payment, and it *obliterating* my credit score, which would basically make it impossible for me to ever move out until it falls off (what, like 7 years later?).

Bankruptcy... I honestly don't know anything about the process. I don't know how to initiate it, or what the repercussions are. How it affects your credit score, or for how long.

140qjnb,Jcorb,"Working remote, 80k/year, need to move in August, what makes the most financial sense for my situation?

Alright, so Iâ€™m a single 35 year-old guy. Iâ€™ve about 12k in credit card yet (I was laid off all last year), I have a car thats paid off, but really nothing beyond that. Iâ€™m currently staying with friends (I gave them a rifle that was worth some money as â€œrentâ€ through August).

So before getting into specifics, I just want to lay out my biggest fear currently; when I was laid off last year, I was living with my father and his wife. It allowed me to live very cheaply, however because he lives in a town with virtually NO jobs, it wound up hurting me, because even when I put I was willing to relocate for work, I never heard back. But when I moved back up to DC (with my friends, where I am now), I had interviews lined up within a few weeks, and started my current job in about a month.

All that is to say; my fear of living someplace inexpensive, is if I ever get laid off again, I want to live somewhere there are jobs.

Right now, my thought process is saving as much money I can through August, just making minimum payments in my cards, and then moving. I have three options that sort of jump out at me:

1. Move back to live with my father. I hate the idea, but logically makes sense. They were only charging me $400/month , and he said theyâ€™d be happy to do that again (I think my dad moreso than his wife, but we got along well enough).

2. Stay around DC. My friends (that Iâ€™m currently with) said theyâ€™re happy to let me stay, to work something out with me so I can keep setting money back or paying off debt. I feel like our personalities kind of clash, though, so the idea makes me uncomfortable. But it does alleviate the fear of living someplace there are no jobs again. Not sure what we would be able to work out, but I feel like somewhere in the ballpark of $600-800 a month would probably be reasonable for the small bedroom Iâ€™ve been â€œrentingâ€ so far.

3. Moving someplace entirely different (leads being Orlando or Honolulu). Okay, those sound kind of wild, but hear me out. Orlando would only be like 4-ish hours away from my family, which would be nice for seeing them without having to use PTO (maybe not an issue with my new work laptop on the way) or paying for travel. Plus, we used to go to the parks almost every summer for so many years, I do like the idea of being someplace they could come down to visit and us all go to the parks whenever. And it SEEMS like a major enough hub, I could probably find other digital marketing work if my current job ever fell through.

Conversely, when I think about where *I* want to live â€” where I honestly feel like I could see putting down roots, especially if I ever meet somebody â€” Iâ€™ve always felt drawn to move to Hawaii. I just never had the guts for it when I was younger (I was kind of a small-town kid, I didnâ€™t think â€œnormal peopleâ€ ever really left where they were born). Since my team are mostly located on the West coast, I donâ€™t think the time difference wouldnâ€™t be a huge factor.

Either way, Iâ€™m likely look at $1600/month rent (maybe less if I spot a good deal). Honolulu, I could possibly try finding a roommate for like 800 until I felt established enough to know where I wanted to buy.

I know thatâ€™s a lot of detail, and it might be totally trivial. But I think context is important, and deciding where to live is a pretty important decision. There are a lot of things to consider.

A couple months of that, I found a client and made about $3k. Then my former employer threatens legal action because of a no-compete agreement Iâ€™d signed like five years prior, so I had to stop everything. A few more months to by, I have a mental breakdown, and friends invite me to live with them near DC. I find a job after another month, then after about three months of work, that company closes the whole department.

I JUST started working again, and I feel like Iâ€™ve been running on fumes for about two years. Iâ€™m literally eating cheese and crackers for lunch. Iâ€™d been able to get by cheap just putting everything on cards, and making sure to cover the payments. But I straight up ran out of money at the end of October, and had to borrow money from a friend just to put gas in my car to make it to my job.

I just got my first (half) paycheck, and itâ€™s not enough to make all of my payments, though I should be able to cover them all end of next week.

For numbers, my new salary is $65k/year, I have about $16k in credit card debt, my car is paid off, and my friends are expecting $1k a month (they might be flexible, but theyâ€™ve already helped me out tremendously). My credit score was like 820 beginning of last year, but steadily dropped as the credit card debt went up, but recently plummeted like a rock because I couldnâ€™t make payments, and couldnâ€™t seem to get much wiggle room. So itâ€™s now sitting around 490.

My mom has floated the idea of filing a Chapter 7 bankruptcy, while two of my friends Iâ€™ve spoken to think the downsides might be too hefty to be worth it.

Right now Iâ€™m sort of feeling like, maybe I just accept that my credit score is fucked, but just continue making payments. Theyâ€™re all insane interest rates, though (one card payment was 265, and 98 of that was interest).

epkesm,Jcorb,"Planning to make additional payments starting with credit card with the highest APR, is that correct?

I'm really going all-out to try and get out of debt in the next few months. I'm kicking myself over a few stupid purchases the past couple of months (I got my own apartment, got too excited and wound up getting a couch and chair that I probably shouldn't have), and I figure it's time to really hunker-down.

Right now, I have a balance of about $1800 on one card (which is 0% interest until September, no early-payoff penalty or anything), a card with about $1500 (*VERY* high APR; I just called to request a lower interest rate, but not holding my breath, it's like 26% APR), and another card with about $200 (not sure the APR; I normally keep it totally paid off).

Just knowing my own personality, I know that when I have money sitting in my bank account, I typically become a bit more lax about spending. I feel like the best solution is to take any excess money, and immediately start throwing it at the 26% APR card, which I could probably pay off in a few months. Then immediately shift towards the $1800 card, hopefully before the interest has a chance to kick in.

ezc7vf,Jcorb,"What would you say is the best advice to offer someone looking to get out of the ""rat race""? And do you think ""retirement"" is still a feasible idea, or is it better to reach a standard of living where minimal work/stress is required to stay afloat?

I wonder, sometimes, if the advice I often receive on ""personal finance"" is now a bit dated.

For example, I don't know a single person under 50 who can reliably count on *retiring* with a company. And I don't know many who are getting by paying much less than *half* their money on housing (the only couple I do know, basically had miraculous circumstances... a kind of took advantage of an elderly lady to do so).

Yet, I'm also not quite ready to live in a camper-van and commit to being some traveling hippie.

I'm just kind of wondering, what does the modern ""preparing for the future"" look like, for those of us in our late-20's or 30's?

Obviously, paying off debt is key, no matter what your goals are. But I do question whether ""retirement"" is even in the cards anymore, or if it's better to try and build a life that's going to simply require minimal work/stress to maintain. To me, the ultimate freedom is being able to say ""f*** you"" to *anyone*, even if it means finding a new job. If you can reach a point that any low-wage job will cover your expenses, I feel like that's the most anyone can hope for in today's world.

Alternatively, I genuinely wonder if a better gameplan would simply be to save up enough money, to just buy a place in a ""third-world country"" on the cheap, and then just save as much as you can until you can reasonably expect to not have to work (for myself, still probably doing what work I am able online, but without expecting too much).

I dunno. I suppose I'm just kind of interested in you guys' thoughts. Doesn't have to be some definitive answer, just where you guys' heads are at, what you're thinking, etc.",Yes,Yes,No,Yes,No
f1vbb4,Jcorb,"Pros and Cons to consolidating debt? Would it be beneficial in my case?

So, right now I have about $4400 in credit card debt, and $6600 on a car loan. It's not an astronomical amount by any means, but I'm getting reamed on some of those credit cards (one I'm making payments of $47/month, and like 45 of that is interest).

I've had some struggles trying to ""save up and then pay debt off in bulk"". Namely, *stuff* keeps coming up, and it's making me question my own sanity a bit (am I just being irresponsible and so I can't get ahead, or am I genuinely just having bad luck or not planning enough for atypical costs, like tires/ registration/ etc?).

So I'm wondering, if I were to consolidate all of my debt into a single payment, perhaps there would be some benefit there? Especially since it's difficult keeping track of when all these different payments come out, since the exact dates they charge seem to constantly fluctuate. That can be problematic, because my rent each month takes out nearly an entire paycheck, and I only get paid twice a month.

I dunno. Maybe it's not worth doing. Just kind of curious what the pros and cons are? And how big a loan can someone reasonably expect to take out, and are they typically low interest for any length of time (ie. many credit cards are 0% APR for the first year)?",Yes,Yes,No,No,Yes
gr4qjq,Jcorb,"Next month, I will have the money to pay off all debt (besides my car loan). Am I right in holding off?

Come next month, I will have the money in the bank to pay off all my debt. Which thankfully isn't all that much now, about $4300 (my car loan is another $5600).

Now one of my debts is $1800, which is interest-free until September, which I plan to pay off in full regardless. For the rest of my debt, however, I'm debating sticking with the minimum monthly payments (which are *mostly* interest, and come out to $95/month).

Here's my thinking;

That little bit of extra cash gives me a *bit* of wiggle-room, in case ""life"" happens. A coworker of mine said during the last recession, a lot of credit card companies were cutting peoples' available credit, and given a recession seems increasingly likely, I feel like I could easily find myself in a position with no debt but also no money.

Now, on the positive side of things, I've managed to cut my spending down quite a lot. I currently bring home $4,078 a month, and I've got my spending to about $2500 a month, which is a cool $1500 a month saved. So it wouldn't take terribly long to accrue enough money to pay it off and *still* have money in the bank.

I guess my thinking is, though, that I'm effectively paying $95/month in order in exchange for *not* paying $3200 off. Things are a little uncertain with my job (I'm personally kicking ass, but I'm in one of the less-profitable departments at my company and we're transitioning into an ESOP; this pandemic could not have come at a worse time), and I guess I just like to plan for the worst.

Or should I just plan on ripping off the band-aid as soon as I can?",No,Yes,No,No,Yes
hdw0mf,Jcorb,"MAJOR car issue, could use some advice how to handle this situation...

Earlier this month (June 5th), I ran over a short tree-stump I didn't see, and through what was described as a ""freak accident"", it managed to catch the plastic cover on the undercarriage and to a *ton* of damage to my car.

Now here's the thing; the shop gave a quote for $4.3k on repairs, but one of the parts required is a computer module that currently is not available *anywhere*, because the factory that makes it has been closed for COVID-19 and it on national backorder. I was told getting this part ""could be a few weeks, or a few *months*"".

I lose my rental car at the start of July, and Geico does not seem willing to extend my rental coverage.

Now fortunately for me, my current boss seems willing to let me work remotely until the end of July. In that time, I need to get this shit sorted out.

Now, let's talk numbers:

I currently owe about $6k on my auto loan. I just checked Kelley blue book, and it looks like my car (2013 Ford Focus) is also worth right about $6k on the low-end. The repairs quoted for my car come to $4.3k.

I have a $1k deductible, and Geico will have covered $900 in rental car fees.

I currently have $2500 in the bank (just paid off some debt, so it hasn't left me much).

Here's my current line of thinking:

Once I verify with my boss that I can work remotely through the end of July, I tell my adjuster that I'm willing to wait a few more weeks. If, by early/mid-July there is STILL no ETA on this part ever becoming available, then I will call them and demand they total my car, so that I may begin shopping for a new car.

Now here's where it gets sort of dicey:

Assuming they even go along with this, let's say they agree the car is worth $6k. Well I have a 1k deductible, so they give me 5k. But I have to pay off the auto loan, which means in addition to what Geico gives me, I *also* pay 1k to get the auto loan paid off.

That would leave me $1.5k for what I currently have. Realistically, though, by next month I would be back to $2.5k in the bank. I'm... not sure that would actually afford me a car. But if I could, then I could pay cash, and even if it only lasted me a year or two, that's about $300/mo I'd save from my current car payment.

Does this... seem like a reasonable course of action?

One alternative my step-dad suggested, is if they *do* ""total"" my car, I pay off the ""salvage"" costs. I don't rightly know how this would work, other than I would pay off the difference to my auto loan, and then just see about getting a refurbished computer part. He looked up the part, and supposedly it's fairly cheap (about $150) with a lifetime warranty.

I *think* the line of thinking here, is that I would probably come out largely the same financially (probably paying an additional $1000-1500 to cover the ""salvage"" cost from Geico), but assuming I got the repairs done myself, I could potentially still have a car and be out from the auto loan.

Of course, if Geico *isn't* willing to total my vehicle, *or* provide a rental car...

Well, I'm pretty much *fucked*, aren't I? My current rental car (the absolute cheapest in the area) is $30/day, and there isn't one anywhere near me, so it's not like I can even just ""rent it through the week"". It's all-or-nothing, and that would basically cost most of what I save. $900 a month, and if the part isn't available for 3-6 months, I would be in a real bad spot.

What do you guys think?

How would YOU handle the situation?",Yes,Yes,No,No,Yes
hsj5pn,Jcorb,"Alright, so I've had some car problems, and I have some numbers to work with. What makes the most sense?

Alright, so I had a car accident last month. My car is valued at $7300, however I have a $1000 deductible. They did $4500 in repairs already to the body and one of the computer parts, however they believe there is now some sort of issue with the transmission (unclear if it's actually the transmission, or another computer part of some kind).

So, they have decided to ""total"" my car. Since the car is valued at $7300, minus the deductible they will send me a check for $6300. I currently owe $5900 on my car loan, leaving me with $400 leftover.

Now, one alternative I asked, and the insurance adjuster just confirmed, is I can actually keep the car if I pay the salvage fee of $1600. I am currently trying to call the garage again, but they were saying the current repair of what they *think* it is might range 1700-2200 (it has to be done through Ford at this point, so I would be responsibly for the cost of towing the car I'm sure). But he also said Ford told them it founded like it could be any one of three issues, or all three. I'm unsure if the 2200 ballpark he gave me was the cost of all three potential repairs?

IN SUMMARY:

Car's value: $7300
Deductible: $1000
Car loan: $5900
Salvage fee: $1600
Potential repairs: $1700-2200(?)

Finally, I currently have $3400 in the bank. And if *necessary*, my mom has agreed to help me out by perhaps as high as $5000, although that's obviously not something I'm eager to take her up on.

What would you guys do in this position? Just wash my hands of it, pay off the loan with the money Geico sends me, and just look into buying something cheap with cash?

Or is it worth taking the risk of paying the salvage fee of the car and paying for whatever the rest of the repairs are out-of-pocket?

EDIT:

Just got a bit more clarification from the garage. He said he contacted Ford about the error code he was getting, and *Ford* said the repairs would probably be looking at $1700-2200. The manager of the shop I was speaking with said he would call over in the morning, and press him to get a little more information, just *how* confident he felt this repair would fix the car, or what the likelihood would be of it potentially being something else. He said he would get back to me in the morning.",Yes,Yes,No,Yes,No
jwjj4d,Jcorb,"I'm finally free of CREDIT CARD debt! So... how should I *actually* be using credit cards?

I know some people are like ""just cut them up"", but frankly, I'd rather give my credit card number out for online services than my *debit* card number. I have a couple of cards already, which are now paid-off, but I feel like I'm finally in a position to begin leveraging them.

For example, should I use a different credit card for each *type* of expense, to better keep track of what I'm spending where (ie. entertainment on one card, groceries on another, misc purchased on Amazon for another)? Or just stick with the one that offers the highest cash-back for *all* expenses? (I believe my AmEx is like 4% on most purchases, 2% on anything that isn't otherwise covered)

Also, I've never once paid attention to things like ""air miles"" or ""bonus points"" or anything like that. I always figured ""that's just stuff rich people pay attention to, to make themselves feel better about spending money"". But, well, maybe I ought to be paying attention to that stuff after all?

One thing that comes to mind, for example; my sister *loves* Disney, and so we try to go once every couple of years. Might it be worth getting a Disney-themed credit card (I think it's through Chase), that the bonuses you get might actually amount to something substantial?

I'd just appreciate any advice. I'm still not 100% debt-free -- I just took out a loan, so I would have some cash on-hand in case ""stuff went down"" around the election (and really, it's nice having cash in the bank, even if it's not really mine, just in case).

But I feel like I'm right there on the cusp of finally being *truly* debt-free, and just looking to start building some better habits. I'm 32, and I've spent so much of my life living paycheck-to-paycheck, only worrying about ""staying afloat"", I want to make sure I nix any lingering bad habits, and replace with good ones.",Yes,Yes,No,Yes,Yes
l9taow,Jcorb,"Unsure if I'm being complacent, if I'm in a good position, or if I need to move on...?

Alright, so I live just outside DC. I make 64k a year. I'm currently renting an apartment for 1650/month (all utilities included except cable), which is a *steal* for this area.

I love my apartment, and I have a pretty comfortable life. Problem is, I worry I'm not moving *forward*.

First off, there's really no room for growth in my career. I'm already pretty much at the top-end for what my profession can hope to make, and the company has told me before that there really isn't anywhere for me to grow upward here, save for minor raises.

I've always read that the goal for buying a house should be about three times your salary, however that is... basically impossible. I would probably be looking at 250-300k for a 3-bedroom home, roughly two hours away from my work. It gets cheaper if I'm willing to commute 3+ hours each way, but... well, *I'm not*.

As for ""Remote Working""... this is the frustrating thing; last year, I worked remotely when it became mandatory. My job can absolutely be done remotely. Problem is, our company president simply doesn't *want* people working remotely, unless the government mandates it. So as long as she remains president, remote working will NEVER be an option. And she's probably 55-60, so there's really no telling how long that could be.

The thing is, I have a pretty good lifestyle. I'm almost 33, single, and live alone. I've always had roommates, and frankly I don't know I could go back to that (barring it being a significant other). This is an expensive area in the country to live, but I can certainly afford to live here. Problem is, I'm not really *getting ahead*. I just recently consolidated my remaining debt, and it will likely be another three months to have it paid off, with very little left over (although I had to purchase a car last year when my last one was totaled, which I was able to pay cash for).

So I guess where I'm finding myself is in this position of complacency. There is no ""finding a better-paying job"". To make more money, OR to live someplace cheaper, it will mean having to find an entirely new career path, starting completely from scratch. It's difficult to explain what I do, but it's incredibly specific, and basically only exists in the DC area, and I'm already making more than most in my field.

So, I would just appreciate some advice.

Roll the dice and try to find a new career, preferably somewhere cheaper? Just continue keeping costs down and paying off debt, and re-evaluate the situation again later? Gamble that my 64k salary is enough for a 250-300k home, and just try to rent the additional rooms out? Any other ideas?",Yes,Yes,No,Yes,Yes
lfkryd,Jcorb,"Early-30's, folks are having health issues, how to weigh your ""prime earning years"" against other priorities in life?

I turn 33 this month, and I'm making 69k (*noice*) a year. I'm living near DC, so it definitely doesn't go as far as it would anywhere else, and I'm in a *very* small field. But I've recognized some places I can cut spending quite a bit, too.

But... well, I saw my dad over Christmas, and it was weird seeing how much some of his ""quirks"" have continues to deteriorate. I want to say he just turned 64, but for the past couple years, his hand would get a little shaky sometimes. This trip, there was a point in which was passing me a glass of water, and his hand was shaking so bad, I thought he was about to drop or spill it everywhere. He barely sleeps, and it's basically in a constant state of ""dozing off"".

Then my mother called (they're long since divorced), and apparently she'd been in the hospital with what seemed to be a heart attack. I guess the doctors figure it wasn't, that it's something else, but will take 6-8 weeks to recover.

I currently make $67k/year, however my job has let me know that my time will be coming to an end at the end of March (I relocated, they allowed me to work remotely until they could replace me, looks like they've found a replacement).

Here's the thing; I ***will not*** be able to get a salary anywhere near my current one. I made that money because I was living near DC at the time; now, I'm in the middle of nowhere (living with family atm). I'm honestly panicking a bit, because what I do is so niche, I don't really know what else I'm qualified to just ""do"" as a job.

Also, I've never really taken a proper ""vacation"" before -- most of the time, I would just take time-off to visit family. Visiting Hawaii has been a lifelong goal of mine, and thought I'd finally found a great trip plan, ironically which would start right around the same time, end of March for like 9 days.

sqwanb,Jcorb,"Been looking at properties in Hawaii, unfamiliar with terms like ""leasehold"" or ""AOAO"". Could anyone clarify some of this, what traps to lookout for vs. what's ""normal""?

My understanding is that a leasehold means you own the ""living space"", or ""the right to live there"", but that if the owner of the property itself decides to say bulldoze the place and build a new building, you'd just be outta luck?

Anyways, I read this paragraph, and just... have no idea what they're talking about:

""*This is a leasehold property, but AOAO has a 62% beneficial interest in fees and is continuing efforts to purchase the remaining interest to convert it into Fee Simple.*""

Is that, like... a *good* thing? What does it mean?

Coming from the mainland, the idea of ""buying a house"" a *not* owning the property sets off all kinds of red-flags in my mind, but my understanding is this is not only common, but *normal* in Hawaii? Land is obviously at a premium, and they aren't making any more of it, so I suppose that's the only way to reasonably allow so many people to live in such a congested location.

Anyways, I'm just trying to get a feel for what the housing market's really like living in Hawaii. I *assume* houses are probably becoming crazy-expensive, just like everywhere else in the country, but I've been looking at listing prices over the years, and... well, they *seem* surprisingly affordable right now? Maybe I'm missing something?

In addition to just answering my stupid questions, I would certainly also appreciate any sort of feedback or advice from anyone who *is* familiar with Hawaii's housing market, particularly Oahu (which feels like it would be the most stable, both in terms of finding employment, and potentially renting-out down the road if possible).",Yes,Yes,No,Yes,No
st7ef6,Jcorb,"Not much money saved, am I better off making minimum payments, or just clearing my debt (but having almost no money saved after)?

Alright, so... I have about 9k in debt left. I have just over 6k in the bank right this second; I could pay off one of my cards which has about 3k in debt. It's like 25% interest, so I'm feeling like that might be a good move.

The other 6k was from a loan, so it's not actually accruing any debt as long as I make payments (which are like $400/month), but by the end of next month I could still *probably* pay it off.

I normally kinda-sorta enjoy building out a budget. But I feel like I'm in a bit over my head with this one. I recently got laid off, so I'm looking for employment, but also considering trying to pick up enough work on the side to live on.

I've wanted to move to Hawaii for many years now, and I recently had a conversation where someone brought up a great point; that since I'm single, and I've already gotten rid of pretty much everything I own (that was prior even to being laid off), I'm about as ""free"" to make a big change as I'm ever going to be.

So I'm trying to figure, what *exactly* would I need to make, to actually move to Hawaii, even for like 6-12 months?

There are some factors I know I can plan for. The cost of groceries looks online to consistently be about 32% higher. I imagine having a vehicle would be out of the question (until I'd lived there long enough to *know* I'm staying indefinitely), so I'd probably need an apartment in-town. Prices fluctuate pretty dramatically, but I feel pretty confident I could find a place for $1500 plus electric and/or internet (I could likely get this WAY lower, but hesitant to rent a room in someone else's house without first seeing the place/meeting them).

Now, I'm trying to also get a feel for what income tax might look like, and how much of a difference of pay I would need comparing ""working for a company"" against ""being self-employed/contracting for multiple clients"".

When I lived in DC, I felt like $65k/year was a pretty good salary; I wasn't *saving* as much as I wanted, but I also didn't need to penny-pinch either, on the rare occasion I actually *did* want to go out with friends.

For one, I have a TON of work-related expenses I'm going to have to look into making, I'm likely going to be doing side-work, I'm in the process of filing for unemployment, and I'm also considering trying to start my own business.

I know that if I DO go the route of starting a business or doing side work, I have to report it, I won't be compensated for that time, and I would be losing access to unemployment. Additionally, A friend if mine said that unless I have an employer that's taking taxes out for me, I should probably take the first 25% of anything I make and put it into its own bank account, solely for taxes.

I'm also curious, if it comes to me trying to do side-work/start my own business, what all I'm ABLE to write off on taxes? Since I'd be working from home, can I write off part of my rent? All of it, even (since I'm renting a room for my dad and his wife, and it's literally my office and I'm sleeping on a futon)?

Their main base is in Chicago but I can technically live anywhere with an airport since Iâ€™ll be flying Monday - Thursday then Friday is WFH. I have a local smaller airport 15 mins from me and obviously all the flights connect to chicago oâ€™hare. 

I was thinking about moving to the chicago city due to the access to the large airport which will cut down on connection/travel time, but also it gives me a bigger social network/professional network too to make more friends, connections etc and just alot more to do in general. And I want that basic live in your 20â€™s city experience that I havenâ€™t had. On the otherhand Iâ€™ll only be there friday - Sunday. I currently pay $1280 on rent and Iâ€™m guessing in chicago it will be double. 

Do you think it make sense for me professional and socially to move to chicago at the exchange of higher costs?",Yes,Yes,Yes,No,No
15jsrmj,Jeeperscrow123,"Supply chain F500 job vs senior operations consulting role with 30% salary bump at age 26?

I currently work as a production planner for a fortune 200 company making 82k base a year. With the economy, future opportunities have slowed down and Iâ€™m not sure if Iâ€™ll have to wait another year for a new role at my company. Iâ€™ve currently been in my role for almost 2 years so Iâ€™m not really learning anything new or developing new skills.  

I got offered a senior operations consulting focused on process and supply chain improvements with a base of $108k along with $10k annual for compensation for all the traveling. Long hours Monday - Thursday but i feel since this role is in the same location and comes with a 30% salary bump and Iâ€™ll be getting to develop more skills that I can potentially use to launch back into supply chain if I donâ€™t like the consulting role after a year or 2, that this opportunity is at least worth trying. 

What would you personally recommend if this was your choice? I am currently single too so I feel like I could absorb the travel life style without too many major impacts.",Yes,Yes,No,No,Yes
15nytd4,Jeeperscrow123,"Would you personally take more hours + weekly travel at a less recognized company in exchange for a 30% bump in salary?

Currently working in supply chain at a fortune 200 company for the past 3.5 years and am 26 years old. 

Got offered a process improvement/supply chain consulting role with a lesser known consulting company, but a top 10 accounting service firm. 

Iâ€™d be traveling Monday - Thursday working about 60 hours a week. 

Iâ€™ve been in my current role for 2 years and future opportunities are a little grey right now due to the economic slowdown. This consulting role would potentially allow me to build key skills such as problem
Solving, communicating to leadership etc it just may not be to huge billion dollar
Companies. Otherwise Iâ€™m not really learning much new in my current role. 

This new role would offer about $115K a year which is slightly over a 30% increase in salary.

What would you do?",Yes,Yes,No,No,No
15pf21f,Jeeperscrow123,"New consulting job as a 26 year old - stay in wisconsin city of 60k and stack $ with the low COL or move to chicago for QOL but higher costs of living + bigger/direct airport, WWYD?

I recently got a new job that is a 30% salary increase and Iâ€™ll be making $108K base a year. I will be traveling and flying out Monday  and flying back Thursday, Friday is work from home.

I have a local airport 20 mins from me in my city of 60K however the flights always connect to Oâ€™hare or Detroit of course. 

Would you as a single 26 year old personally chose to stay living where I am in the low cost of living since I can basically stack $$?  Or would you personally move to chicago and pay double for rent and other expenses even though you wouldnâ€™t even be living there 4 days a week but in exchange you get a better quality of life/things to do and more direct flights out of the airport which could save a couple hours and potentially a bigger network?

Also since I wouldnâ€™t be moving until early November, at that point since chicago basically shuts down like wisconsin during the winter time for activities, does it make sense to just stay put until the spring? No point moving for a higher cost apartment if Iâ€™ll just be inside the whole time?",Yes,Yes,No,No,Yes
15toqky,Jeeperscrow123,"Should you ask new employer for a little extra $ if youâ€™ve already accepted but after receiving leverage from current employer offering counter offer?

Signed job with current employer and got a promotion with them and higher $ and was in the midpoint range of the new role. 

If my current employer has counter offered even if I donâ€™t want the counter offer, is it worth using to ask for $5K more with the new employer or would that not be recommended?",No,Yes,No,No,No

16i3o80,Jeeperscrow123,"Breaking my apartment lease early to move to new job out of state - which potential penalty option to take?

Option 1: pay 200% of monthly rent at time of move out as a buyout charge (AKA 2 months of rent that I wouldnâ€™t be living there for then)

Option 2: move out and if someone moves into my apartment, I donâ€™t incur the 200% buyout charge. BUT if someone doesnâ€™t move in, essentially Iâ€™d keep paying rent every month until someone does. 

Option 2 would save me money if someone moved in but is more risky if someone doesnâ€™t. Since the colder fall/winter times are approaching and less people are likely to be moving, I was thinking about just accept the 200% buyout charge. Does the PF community agree this makes sense even though It sucksv",No,Yes,No,No,Yes
1778hy3,Jeeperscrow123,"Should I sell my used car if moving to a big city if I might need a car in 2 years since I wonâ€™t live in the downtown area forever?

Accepted a Job in downtown chicago and wonâ€™t need my current car (and likely wonâ€™t want one since parking is insane and painful and expensive) but I donâ€™t see myself living downtown forever, maybe for 2ish years and once I move out of there, Iâ€™d need a car to get around 

I currently have like a 2008 Mazda with only 120K miles that runs perfect and has no issues still. 

Does it make more sense to sell my car and potentially just buy a new one when I need it in 1-3 years? Or should I just stash it at my parentâ€™s house in tennessee for that free parking and then if I need a car in 2 years I donâ€™t have to worry about it lol",Yes,Yes,No,No,No

1783x7i,Jeeperscrow123,"Is signing a longer apartment lease (18 months) that doesnâ€™t allow you to break the lease worth $200 a month savings and no rent increases for a while?

While I donâ€™t necessarily anticipate moving, itâ€™d be nice to have flexibility. 

But the nice thing about that lease apart from saving $200 a month is also in the lease it is stated they wonâ€™t increase rent before the 18 months is up. 

Thoughts? Would you rather take the longer lease or pay more for something like a 12 months one.",No,Yes,No,No,No

Currently I live in Logan square, a neighborhood a couple miles outside of downtown chicago and travel most days of the week by plane anyways. So really I only drive it for the occasional outside city trip or a once a month larger grocery trip.

My insurance costs are fairly minimal at $700 a year. 

I donâ€™t plan on living in chicago forever so Iâ€™m thinking if I did sell it, Iâ€™d have to purchase a new car in 2 years anyways and getting a new used car would probably cost much more.
