Hi everyone, im 19 and am trying to be on the right path.

I understand the end of the year is coming and I should definitely utilize the 6.89% before itâ€™s too late, or should I? Im not sure yet but know the time is closing in soon. 

The only reason I would need to utilize this money is for next fall when I buy 15-20 head of cattle as an investment. I know there are 1,2,3,4,5 month ladders you can do but iâ€™m still a little shaky on knowledge when it comes to that.

1. If the bank loans our money out, why don't we see the withdrawals on our accounts? 

2. Since the banks loan our money, do we have access to all the funds? Say I have 50k in savings and the bank is using my funds to finance loans. I don't really have 50k in my account as the bank just used my money for other things ?

Quick summary of my financial situation. I make 77k a year, have 100k saved, and have a 750 credit score. The cars I'm interested in cost 50-72k. My problem is that I'm an extremely cheap person with most aspects of life but dont have a cheap taste with cars.

I've spent weeks crunching numbers, but car prices and interest rates are so high that it's turning me off from wanting to buy a car at all. Even with a decent credit score, I would still qualify for a 5-7% interest rate, which is still high to me. I would have to put 40-50% down on some of these cars  just to get a 500-700 payment. That's still an incredibly high payment for that much money down ( not including insurance)

So I have a situation I want some advice on. It's lengthy so please follow along. I'm 24 and I currently still live at home with my mother and grandma. I've stayed home for this long to save money for a house over an apartment. Plus I like helping my mom with bills even though it's not needed.  I'm currently in contract to buy a duplex for 210k 1200sqft, 3br, 1.5 baths each side. I guess each side can rent for $900-1000 each side. 1 tenant is leaving on the 1st of April and the other is M2M. If I do end up closing on this property, I want to know the best way to handle it. I'm financing with 3% down with a portfolio loan, I'm not sure if I HAVE to owner occupy with this loan. So my options are.

1. Fully rent both sides and stay where I am now. ( $1800+ income )
2. Fully rent one side to strangers then stay on the other side and get 1-3 roommates. ( I  move out my mom's, live rent-free while making $1800+ income).
3. Fully rent one side and stay on the other side with my mom and grandma. ( This option makes less money because I would charge my mom less in rent ).

I'm looking for both financial and ethical advice. I would like to have my mother and relative move in but I wouldn't feel comfortable having her pay me more in rent than she pays now.

qqzh6k,SillyRecover,"25 Years Old And Don't Know What To Do About Living Situation. Looking For Advice.

I recently turned 25 and still live at home with my mother and grandmother. I have 50k saved and I make 50k a year. We split the rent 3 ways so I only have to spend $300 on rent each month. This has allowed me to accelerate my savings to what I have now.  The main reason I have stayed home this long is to save up enough money to buy a house ( preferably a duplex ).

I want to purchase a duplex and rent out one side with the tenant mostly paying the mortgage. While I stay on the other side with a roommate. By doing this I would live rent-free and could possibly be able to turn a profit ( At worst I live rent-free). I went to school for Real Estate at a young age ( 18 ) and I was educated on the Ins and Outs of housing. I learned that there are advantages to owning a home over renting an apartment.

In my city, a decent 2 bedroom apartment will run you about $1000-1100 in rent per month. Rents for most apartments in my city go up about $100 per year lately. For example, If I were to buy a 220k duplex ( Which is basically two houses ) my mortgage would be about $1200 for the life of the loan. In the end, the mortgage doesn't matter since I wouldn't be paying it myself. The thing is that millions of other Americans have realized what I explained above and are catching on. The housing market in my area is now EXTREMELY competitive and it's making it hard to land something desirable.

Over the last 2 years, I've slowly gained the desire to move out more and more. I want my own place that I can decorate and set up as I wish. I recently had a friend move to a new apartment and he has a spare room and he asked me to move in and I've been debating on it. One issue is that if I move I would take on an extra $500+ of monthly expenses. We would split his $1050 rent and utilities both ways. The other issue is that he's moving to a location/apartment that I don't necessarily have a desire to live in/at.

Yes, I want to move out but that doesn't necessarily mean I want to be in any situation. I want to purchase a house and go with my original plan as I explained above. I've been debating if it's worth taking on the extra expenses for another place I don't necessarily want to be. I would be leaving one situation I don't want to be in just to join another.

And before someone asks, I'm an adult. I pay my own bills, wash my own clothes, buy my own groceries, wash my own dishes, etc. I just simply live in my mother's house. I'm single and introverted, I mostly keep to myself. I don't see much change if I were to move with my personal life. I don't think it's really hindered my personal/sex life. A lot of people in my age group still live at home and the women I've run into don't really care. Most of them live at home still themselves for the reasons I explained above.

w9sue0,SillyRecover,"Is it worth it for me to open a 401k/retirement account ?

I'm 25 and I make 75k yearly and have 45k saved up. I work for a major insurance firm so there are a godly amount of benefits and perks to look over.  I've never really taken the time to open an investment account. Part of it is because I never really fully understood it. 

I switch jobs a lot in my career (1-3 years ) field. For most companies, you must stay there for 5 years to be fully vested. I never thought it was worth it if I knew I wasn't going to be with the company long anyway.  What happens to the money if I have to change companies ?. What if my new employer uses a different bank for their investment accounts ( fidelity vs wells Fargo ), does the money transfer over?

I made a thread similar to this a week ago and this is the follow up. I spoke to my company HR about 401K. They match 50% up to 8%. To be fully vested you have to be employed 5 years ( it escalates 20% a year until 100% ).

Hi! So I am currently filling out a W-4 for my third job and I am a bit confused. 

So I have two jobs and I got this third one that I am filling out the W-4 for (Don't worry, it's just a full-time, a part-time, and this is a paid volunteer-based gig). Anyway, I did the Multiple Jobs Worksheet.

- My main job is salaried. 40 hours/week paid bi-weekly.
- My part-time job is part-time, 9 hours/week paid bi-weekly.
- This third paid volunteer position is where you sign up for shifts. It's variable hours depending on if I want to work a shift or not. There can be a chance that I don't even work for this gig for a month. I don't expect heavy hours. I don't know if this is biweekly/monthly pay.

***(c) Extra withholding. Enter any additional tax you want withheld each pay period . .*** 

After doing the Multiple Jobs Worksheet, I've got $143 for my Extra withholding for Step 4c. It doesn't seem correct because I know I won't be earning that much from my paycheck especially since I anticipate light hours like 3-4 hrs a shift if I was free and willing to do the shift.

I'm lost in what this all means since I'm not well-versed in these things. My brain says they'll deduct $143 each paycheck no matter what (I don't know if my pay is biweekly/weekly since I haven't volunteered yet. It just feels like I won't get paid at all due to this withholding.)

I wanted to play it safe and ask before I submit this form.

- Maxed out my Roth IRAs so far (taking it slow this year instead of lump summing); retirement fund (target 2060 index fund)

- Matched workâ€™s contributions to 401k (started job last year); auto investing in a retirement fund (either 2050-2060)

- Brokerage, rarely contribute to this (investing only in Schwab Total Stock Market)

- Currently my strategy with my income is mostly budgeting my paycheck. Put $1300k in an Ally HYSA every month for â€œrentâ€ and $500 auto deposited to an emergency fund every month. Itâ€™s really where most of my non-spending money goes since I still feel new with investing.

I just came back from an anime convention out of town, so there was a lot of transactions big and small. (Venmo Payments for Hotel and other things, Withdrew a lot of cash for spending money, Plane Tickets, Food, etc.) but I have most of the transactions accounted for. 

Although I've mostly used cash this weekend, I did pay some stuff with ""Apple Pay"". I still have my card. I don't recall using my pin number.

I'm honestly worried about if my card got compromised. I'm afraid of depositing money. I'm afraid of them overdrafting me. I'm gonna try to keep marking down what each transaction was for. I'll make a trip to the bank tomorrow, but until then I wanted to know if banks would be able to get more insight on a specific transaction so I know if it's fraudulent or something.",Yes,Yes,No,Yes,Yes

I don't have a good relationship with him. I don't talk to him. He turned into a gambling addict.

hyas1c,SilverSquare,"I want to get a Credit Card. But I got a question regarding ""Total Annual Gross Income"" in regards to a first time applicant, UI, and lack of a job.

Hi /r/personalfinance.

For the past couple of months, I've been learning about personal finances and have done a decent job at budgeting. Now, I feel like is a good time to take the next step and get a credit card since I've been using my debit this entire time.

I'm 27 in California. Chase is my current main bank. Regrettably never had a credit card. I've been with my bank since February escaping a previous bad situation with a different bank (long story short, had a joint account with my father and he stole money, so I'm in the process of closing that account.)

I want this card so that I can start building credit. I've also heard it's safer to use your credit card online versus a debit card as you're covered more. Though, I got some questions I wanted to ask.

1. **Am I able to get a credit card online/phone instead of in-person?** I'm not in a safe position to leave the house as much due to my family and I being in a high risk category for COVID.

2. ""Total Annual Gross Income"" is a question I see on Chase's ""get a decision in seconds"" application. I've been furloughed and then eventually forced to resign (due to me rejecting hours in fear of COVID.). I worked at this job from November up to last week. I've been currently collecting Unemployment since March/April. **How do I calculate what my gross income is? Do I calculate my time from Nov-March? Do I calculate my Unemployment? Do I even have a ""Total Annual Gross Income"" since I was forced to resign and I'm no longer working?**

3. **Are my chances of getting a credit card through Chase pretty good since that's my current bank?** I've looked into this and IIRC that if I didn't sign up during my time in college where it was easier, that I'd most likely have to look into a secured credit card. **Would my short, but current time in Chase along with money I've been saving up help me out?**

Sorry if these questions sound silly. I'm still new to things in adulthood... even at 27.",Yes,Yes,No,Yes,Yes

I wanted to check my credit score out of curiosity. Parts of me are curious and want to know if it's 0. Parts of me, I have slight anxiety that my family might've affected my credit because they can tend to be shady like that.

I went to the Annual Credit Report website that I saw linked and went to fill out all my information and for some reason I can't get my report because my records don't match. I entered my legal full name, I got my SSN. I even got my birth certificate and social security number. Is there a reason why I can't get a credit report? Is it because I never had a credit card before? Or is there a more pressing issue I should be worried about?

Hey guys, just a 27-year-old trying to get control of his life, so sorry if this is a noob question. But I'm ready to make the next big move. Getting a credit card.

I've never had a credit card in my life. The journey so far was just sharing a card with my Dad until something happened and I decided to get my own card in a different back.

I currently have a debit card (checking account) with Chase and I'm one year into being with them. I've been doing well with saving money and currently have $20k saved up.

I was laid off from my full-time job since the pandemic. Currently job hunting, but my only two sources of income are my streaming and my part-time contract job. My stream doesn't pay as much, maybe around $100 every two months. My part-time job lasts until July. In total, my estimate gross-income so far looks like it's going to be around $5k-$6k.

I know it's hard without credit. I'm not a student. I'm worried my estimate gross-income is low. I guess I'm just hoping they would accept my application for a Chase Freedom Card based on me being good with saving money as well as the fact that I'm already a member of their bank.

At the same time, I know that it may not matter, so I wanted to ask you guys at /r/personalfinance. Do I have a decent case for this? Or would I most likely have to find a secured/starter card?",Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes

Hi everyone. 28 year old, late-bloomer, from California looking to invest in my future. Got a 6-month emergency savings fund of $9000, currently not at a full time so no 401k. So my next goal is Roth IRA. Tried to do research and look at the wiki, but I have some simple newbie questions since I have trouble understanding them.

1. **Was transferring $6000 from my bank to my Roth Contributory IRA (for the 2020 year) just as simple as that in terms of ""contributing"" to my IRA?** At least for the bare minimum? Theoretically, can I just do that and leave it be for the bare minimum or is there more action I need to take?

2. **Why do I have a Roth Contributory IRA instead of a regular Roth IRA?** I signed up on Schwab with the intention of a Roth IRA. Is it the same or are they different?

2. I already transferred the money. It's tradeable. **If I choose to trade, Do I have until the tax deadline May 17th to trade or do I have a lot of time since my money is already there?**

3. **As someone who is still new to this, what are possible options?** A friend and online research seem to recommend to put it all on Index Funds. I used Schwab. Would the S&amp;P 500 or Schwab Total Stock Market Index FundÂ® be things I should be eyeing?

4. **Do I put all $6000 on an Index Fund?** Or should I just consider putting a partial amount?

5. **Once May 17th passes. Can I withdraw the 6000 I contributed to the 2020 year any time I want?** I know I can withdraw what I contributed without penalty as long as it's not earnings. Wanted to know if there was a ""cut-off date."" I don't plan to withdraw, but it's more of a ""just in case of emergency/last resort"" type of deal.

nup6j6,SilverSquare,"Got approved for my first credit card! But I still have worries and questions I want to ask you all.

Hi guys! I've been learning a lot on /r/personalfinance. I got my first credit card. I'm 28, but I was surprised that my first application for a Chase Freedom Unlimited Card got accepted. I was expecting to get rejected and start with a secured card.

My credit limit is $1500.

Was I lucky? I'm not a college student anymore. Never had any loans, student debt thanks to financial aid. Nothing I've done for me to expect me to have a score (if any at all) that'll get me accepted.

I had a linked debit card with my Dad at another bank that I've had since college. Then things happened (he took money from my account without asking, caused overdrafts, etc.) and in 2020 I changed to Chase where I've maintained a checking account. Currently around 15k. Just became frugal with my only ""big"" transaction being a transfer to my brokerage for my Roth IRA.

I don't know if I was just lucky or if Chase saw that I maintained a high balance for over a year. Still just a little worried since I know many people got rejected by Chase for their first credit card. My parents weren't the best at money. Back then, Mom didn't understand credit cards and would spend a lot. My dad wasn't any better. I have reason to believe they might've opened a card under my grandpa's name (consensually, but still not responsible). I'm just afraid with their past history of not being good with money that they might've opened something under my name without me knowing?

**tl;dr:**

* **I'm happy to get my first credit card with Chase! Is there a way to check my credit score to make sure my parent's bad financial history didn't affect me? (ex. Didn't open a credit line under my name or something..)**

* **I know there's three companies (Equifax, etc.) that can check. From my understanding, I get one free check from each for a year. I'd rather not ""waste"" it incase I should wait for like the end of the year. What do you recommend the strategy is?**

* **Was I lucky to get a Chase Credit Card as my first card? 28. I assumed I didn't have a credit score or a ""default score"". I don't have anything like loans or debt that I can think of. Even at a credit limit of $1500, I feel very lucky.**",Yes,Yes,No,Yes,Yes

So far I think I feel like I'm definitely making a lot of improvements on my finances and would love to see if you guys can evaluate my strategy.

1. **Capping** my Chase Checking Account at around **$3000**. Anything above that gets deposited to the High Yield Savings Account or on an index fund.

2. **Build my credit** by using my Chase Freedom Unlimited Card by using it and paying it off. Only utilizing 30% of my credit.

2. Open a **High Yield Savings Account** at Ally. Deposit my Emergency Savings + other things like an overseas vacation trip, etc.

Hi, I have 4000-5000 in cash. About 70% of that was cash I had stashed for a Japan trip pre-pandemic. 30% is general savings from gifts, allowance or whatever. The Japan trip stash was from withdrawing it and putting it aside my paychecks pre-pandemic (laid of due to COVID from that previous job). General savings is self-explanatory.

Why do I have it in cash? One, had an incident where I had a shared checking account with my Dad (US Bank) and he took money, so I panic withdrew and kept my money. I switched to a different bank (Chase), but this was right before the pandemic, so I didn't have the opportunity to deposit.

Two, I just didn't know better. Learned about how to handle my finances better and now know it's better to keep it at a bank, high yield savings account, investments/retirement, etc. instead of letting it collect dust.

I know traveling around with a lot of cash on me is a big risk. I'm definitely gonna err on the side of safety. But in terms of legal stuff, is there anything I need ahead of time? I never deposited through a teller. Always through ATMs.

Hi guys, recently got a credit card a few months ago and am curious about credit utilization. To my understanding, you donâ€™t use your entire credit line if you want to increase your score. My credit line is $1500, so $450 is what I should aim for.

Question is, what if I spent like $200 on the first week, paid it off and spend $300 more by my third week. 

It would mean I spent $500 total. Would my credit utilization still remain under 30% since I paid off the $200? Thus meaning it goes back to 0% until I paid more?

Hi, it's almost been a year since I've started on this journey of being more informed and trying to improve my personal finances. Late bloomer where I started at 28 (now 29 today)

To get right to the point, I have some simple questions about Roth IRAs. So I've started one earlier this year. I'm using Charles Schwab and in my Roth IRA, I'm using SWYNX which is a Schwab Target Index Fund for my retirement year (2060).

In **2020**, I maxed my contributions at 6K since I got furloughed and stayed at home.

In **2021**, I currently have $4K. Got a new salaried job in the summer. **At this current state, should I top it off with the remaining $2K? Or should I keep it at $4K? My gross income is $60K. In Cali, my net income would be about $10-20K lower?** I haven't maxed it yet because in the past I wasn't sure about my job situation and was worried the end of the year might be too late to reap the benefits.

In **2022**, I currently have nothing saved. Currently continuing what I did late 2021 which was to deposit $500 biweekly. I heard it's best to do one lump sum of $6K as soon as I can to take advantage of compound interest. **If Roth contributions are based off my taxed income, do I have to wait till I make $6K? If not, what if I contribute $6K now and hypothetically I get fired in two weeks? Would that screw me over?**

vhtozs,SilverSquare,"What happens when a medical claim is denied?

Stressed out and my first time really using insurance on my own and don't have family to help. Long story short, was talking to a psychiatrist about ADHD, told me to get a Blood Test (got it at LabCorp). This was a little over a month ago. They said it was covered, their website said it was covered by my insurance. My insurance is Anthem Blue Cross (Anthem Premier PPO 250/15/10)

Was looking at my claims. Saw two denied claims. Both from the blood test. One was an in-network charge. $290 for Outpatient. I'm assuming that's just going there for the first time. According to the claim, my discount would've meant it covered it all. I don't know if this means I'm off the hook or this is what I would've had if I was covered.

The other claim was for my blood test. Apparently, it was out-of-network because of the lab they sent my blood to? It was denied. It was billed at around $1800+ and according to Anthem, the discount would've paid for it all. This was also denied.

Looking at my Explanation of Benefits, I only owe $15 which is just a copay from my psych, which I'm fine with.

**Outpatient/Office Visit (Labcorp) | In Network | $290+**: Denied Code **H29**, In accordance with the ICD9/10 coding guidelines a manifestation diagnosis code is not eligible as the only diagnosis billed on claim or claim line. This service is not a covered expense. 

**Blood Test Lab Results (Labcorp) | Out-Of-Network (what) | $1.8k+**: Denied Code **222**, The claim was submitted to the wrong health plan. The doctor or facility should submit it to the Blue Cross and Blue Shield plan in their state. The member will receive a new Explanation of Benefits after the claim is resubmitted to the correct health plan.

* What do I do from here? Will I eventually be charged the $290 + $1.8k or am I off the hook because it's not giving me any financial responsibility or telling me I owe anything in my EOB? I still don't know if the numbers they're showing where I'm getting the full discount for both is just how it'd be if the claim were approved.

* I don't even know how to get the claim submitted to the right health plan. Theoretically if it's in my dashboard, it should be good? Do I just go to the LabCorp that I went to and ask?

- I am currently using YNAB to help manage my finances and trying to see how I can utilize that better.

- Not too much outgoing expenses outside of me eating out, subscriptions, or medicals (I have diabetes, depression, and ADHD so meds/checkups tend to stack up). I currently use public transportation and spend around $150 a month. I just got my driver's license, so I know that I'll be saving up for a car and paying car insurance. Health insurance is deducted from my paycheck and I pay copay.


**Spending Context**:

- $2200 gets automatically deposited each month from my bank to a HYSA. For me, I currently live at home. This is my â€œwayâ€ of simulating how much monthly expenses would be if I moved out (Rent + Other Expenses). Currently using a HYSA since itâ€™s the more safer, less volatile â€œset it and forget itâ€ option. Could possibly parlay this into my emergency fund or maybe I can use this for investing into my index fund or other stocks. Either way, looking to move out within the next 1-2 years and I know that would mean my income would be slashed in half because it'd be going towards to rent.

- I maximize my Roth IRA every year at the beginning if possible.

- I currently don't have a system in regards to my investment accounts (no automatic transfers, no system of investing x each x amount of days, etc.)

- I currently use the 50-30-20 budget style with my remaining budget of $1200. I feel like this can be too limiting especially after moving $2200 every month to a HYSA.",Yes,Yes,No,Yes,No
xklzze,SilverSquare,"Would it be worth getting a Schwab Bank High Yield Investor Checking Account?

***TLDR: Would the Schwab Bank High Yield Investor Checking Account be worth opening up to have in my back pocket for the benefits of the foreign transaction/ATM fees whenever I travel internationally again? Or would it be redundant if I am seeking to get a credit card down the line that has no foreign transaction fee?***

Hi! I just got back from my first international trip and the travel bug bit me. At the same time, I'm developing the next step in improving my financial situation in regards to getting cards/credit cards that will help me have more flexibility and benefits. Been researching and asking peeps between here and the Credit Card subreddit. **TLDR at the top and everything below this is just for context/mind dumping that you don't have to read. But feel free to throw any advice if you want.**

---

To give a quick high-level overview of my personal finance situation, I've tried to follow the flowchart as much as I can, so I got my emergency funds covered, etc. I'm financially responsible with no debt and I pay off my balances as soon as I can. But I'm still new to a lot of things.

- **Chase Checking Account** (no Savings Account)
- **Credit Card: Chase Freedom Unlimited** (my first credit card, 1yr/4mo old, $2k credit).
- **Ally High Yield Savings Account** (to build interest instead of keeping it all on my normal bank, for now it's my main interest maker as I want to learn how to approach and get comfortable with investments better.)
- **Investment Account: Charles Schwab**
    - My Roth IRA and Brokerage are in there
    - I try to max out my Roth contributions at the beginning of the year when possible.
    - My brokerage/investments can be improved, but that's another story for another time since I need to do more research before being comfortable. So far I got a grand in an index fund (SWTSX).
- **401K: Empower**
    - I match my company's match for the ""free money"". All goes into a 2060 Retirement Fund. Set and forget, but might audit and see if there's any thing I should change for efficiency.

Good start especially since pre-pandemic this was virtually non-existent. I'm 29y/o and slowly getting my life together lol, but glad I'm starting now than later. Currently figuring out the next steps and outside of learning more about investments, I'm trying to figure out what to add.

**Current Personal Finance Plan**:

- **Adding a Second Credit Card**
    - I'm thinking about adding Chase Freedom Flex and then go for one of Chase Sapphire Preferred/Reserve to complete the ""Chase Trifecta"". Deciding between Freedom Flex now, then Sapphire or get the CSP now since I'm pre-approved and then apply for Freedom Flex. Aiming to maximize benefits and eyeing travel benefits.

- **Study Basic Investing**
    - I know there's different systems like how to divide up between stocks, bonds, etc. There's also CDs, etc. I just need to figure out what's right since there's a lot of options and it feels overwhelming. For now focusing on the basic stuff. Investing in stock in companies is probably the farthest I'll go as I don't plan on getting into NFTs or Cryptos. Main priority is improving my current system.

- **Open a Schwab Bank High Yield Investor Checking Account**
    - I already have my brokerage through here. I heard it's beneficial since there's no minimum or annual/monthly fee. What opened my eyes with no foreign transaction/international fees. Would it be worth having this even if some time down the line I'll be aiming for a Chase Sapphire Card?",Yes,Yes,No,Yes,No
z3ahsz,SilverSquare,"Should I open a savings account at my bank even though I have a HYSA? Redundant or are there advantages that I may not know about?

What I did was consolidated all my debt twice over the last 2 years into two personal loans due to some behaviors that I have since changed and continue to work on. Not the topic for discussion. 

PL 1 -9.7k - $223 payment
PL 2 20.5k - $475 payment 

My wife has a vehicle that is not paid off yet around 8k with payments around 300-350 (extra put towards) that she alone has been paying. 

Emergency fund is around 2 months a bit less than that but some items like car insurance is paid every 6 months etc., with the ability to stretch longer if we needed to cut a bunch of items. My wife works as well. The reason why she doesn't contribute to the E-fund is she is paying her way through college right now, and the items would be like dining out less, less buying items, etc. We are in fact cutting those already so the focus doesn't need to be put here either. 

We have goals of saving for a house, so in order to do so, I am wondering what the best option is? Specifically would like to buy a house in 2 years, i am guessing it will be 3 at this rate. I have stopped contributing to the savings account as I was putting $200 every two weeks there. 

Get E Fund to 6 months? Pay off the car? Avalanche the two loans by paying off the smaller one first? I can probably pay off her car loan or my smaller loan in 14 months, possibly sooner which is where my gut is telling me to go, but worried about the E Fund not being 6 months.",Yes,Yes,No,Yes,Yes
10upmk9,sirspike345,"Grand plan written out, advice on missing items?

grand plan, thoughts please

So. I've posted a few times over the last few months here and personal finance and first time home buyer. I think I finally have my grand plan + direction for about 24-48 straight months if nothing changes for my wife and I, or at least nothing drastic. 
Edit: this is the order of the next 36 months for priority 
1. Pay off taxes around 4k in March. 
2. Pay off wife's car loan of 4500 in May
3. Summer/vacation planning for stuff ~around 2k (3 bachelor parties + weddings for three best friends between May-October)
4. ~14 months from now pay off consolidation loan #1 ~9k 
5. ~28 months from now Pay off consolidation loan #2 ~21k
6. Grow emergency savings from ~2 months to 6 months. 
7. Save for first time home buyers down payment. Looking to save in two parts. 10k for closing costs/extras and about 25k-35k for a down payment for a 220-250k house. (Currently around 16k saved for both these things (majority in a CD) for both e-savings and down-payment stuff. 

I have several differented allocated accounts to cover bases, investing, and overall saving that I will continue but pause the bigger amounts. Basically think Dave Ramsey 'ish because I will always continue to invest while paying off stuff. Next thing to tackle after buying a house will be both mine and my wife's student loans. But I'm happy to say I do not have any CC debt after consolidation, no car payment, no medical bills, and rent is cheap so we are able to accelerate/avalanche the savings/debt pay off. I've mapped out majority of the bills/budget so I think once I pay off her car loan then she will be able to pay off student loans quicker or pay for her schooling that she's in right now. 

In 36-48 months my goal is to be able to have 30-40k for the first house + 18-20k as an e fund.

I just had a substantial raise and added another credit card that has a better rewards than my current one to help with mindset/vacations. 

I started a side gig for flipping stuff and refinanced my student loans. Since I graduated college almost 3 years ago I have raised my annual income to almost a living wage (for my lifestyle) and gotten married. 

I have some huge ideas in the future, a lot of debt, very little in terms of net worth, and a hard'ish job. But a lot of work has been paying off and I feel so much more confident in myself and budgeting for a long time. But, as I started, Google Sheets is huge and has allowed me to really focus on these various items from budgets, forecasting, calculators, and my side gig. I haven't needed a financial planner, paying for someone to handle my investments, or needed to pay someone for advice. The internet is a great place and I made this to shout my own accomplishments, but also to say that YOU can do it too! Good things come to those who wait.",Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes,No
od1pu8,sirspike345,"Emergency fund idea, anyone else done this yet?

Has anyone done something like this as well? 
TL:DR - using a brokerage to create another savings account 

I have 2 savings accounts. Both with horrible yield. Taking 1 and putting into a taxable brokerage. I've been fiddling with a M1 pie for a bit and I think I finally have the right mixture of bonds/etfs to never lose more than 2%. Which yes. Sounds like a lot. But if you're a Dave Ramsey person and he says 1k at first in the bank 2% is only $20. But if it's 11% growth than it's $110. 

Yes there is more than that to it. The idea is to grow it by month. 

I will have 1 savings account set at 1k. 

Than I will have the 2nd emergency account go from 500-1500, when it reaches 1500 I will sell $500 and place that into a new high yield savings account so I won't lose. 
Than get to 2500 and put 500 more into the HYS, than get to 3500 and so on and so forth until I get 6 months of emergency savings into my brokerage. 

The idea is for a dual component. Knowing I have 1 safety net with the 1k than growing 1 to grow another for a total of 3. The brokerage will turn into saving for a house after 6 months of savings. 

There are risks to this. 
1. Taxable brokerage. Means I gotta pay taxes... not great. But I'm in a low tax bracket and when I sell for capital gains I need to make sure I have money for taxes later. 
2. Taxable brokerage also means ups and downs in the stock market. Lots of risk. Which is why I tried to come up with some good mixture of items to the point where nearly every item in the US will need to tank. I have to do a little more digging into this for negative correlation for the etf growth stuff. 
3. People will say I'm ""over thinking"" with ""too many options"" but once this starts there won't be much to lose if I make my money back. And I'm not looking to gain $$$ over night. Just a long term saving method. 

Andddd it's basically free money from when my great grandparents give me some money when I was like 5 and it was left in a savings account and it's only grown. So I'm only using that + only about $200 of my own working money (not from my current savings account).",Yes,Yes,No,No,No

Tax bracket/income question. SOLVED

THIS HAS BEEN SOLVED. I MISUNDERSTOOD NERD WALLET. THANKS FOR EVERYONES HELP!

I'm wondering about moving the 12% to 22% bracket how big of a pay increase is necessary to make the new tax bracket worth it? 

Currently in the 12% bracket, but I'm applying for a position that would put me into the 22% bracket. I'm wondering if I make just enough into the next bracket if my net income will actually decrease because I have to pay more taxes. That would drop me below my current payscale?

Edit: married, filing jointly

Edit 2: I'm referring to the ""taxes owed"" side of things where it says $2,055 plus 12% of the amount over $20,550.

ypxvdk,sirspike345,"Crazy Emergency Fund idea in action

Decided to take a convoluted idea and use it for my emergency fund on my way to 3-6 months. It's not perfect, very different. 

At one point I had started following Ramsey for a bit. I liked it, thought he made some sense (this was before my realization what some budget terms and reasons were. So the first step was the $1,000 in savings. Well. I loved it, I did that. But a savings account wasn't doing anything for me by just sitting there. So I started doing some research and ideas on M1 finance. Some pie creations. I made an emergency fund on M1 finance. Market is in the downturn, and I'll play with it once it's positive. But I have 1k there. Now, I decided to do two more things. 1. Hold $500-1k cash. 2. Use robinhood gold and have $500-1k sitting there using the 3.5% monthly interest. 

So goal by next summer I will be on my way to my 3-6 months emergency fund with goals of $1k+ in each one, with four levels of liquidity and growth. 

From most liquid/low growth to highest

1. Cash (1K)
2. Bank savings account ($1k)
3. Robinhood Gold brokerage ($1k)
4. M1 finance E-fund pie ($1k+)

Many will say this is a silly idea, but pairing the compound interest with safety and in the market will be key for an emergency fund that people only touch in emergencies.

So... I was trying to figure out some savings account stuff. Didn't get it done properly and screwed myself a tad but it's fixable. I just left a job. I got my PTO paid out, etc. Now I have a decent chunk in my checking. I was going to pay a bit down on my credit cards as the usage is way too high. But I found a huge issue. I have 1 more 40 hour check coming from the job, but I had put down to pay an extra $20 per pay period for federal taxes, but it took ONLY $20 for federal taxes. So now I'm screwed. I have chosen my last paycheck now to go all towards federal taxes. 

So now I have high credit usage, about 6k in checking. I will have a new job starting in December and probably owe close to the full 9k in taxes or whatever the amount is for married filing jointly.

Looking for some basic info and feedback about MBAâ€™s!

Disclaimer: I have little knowledge on graduate degrees. Just starting to research.

(Posted this in MBA community but not much luck)

Background:

* 24 M
* Working in Occupational Safety
* Washington D.C. Metro area
* Graduated with a B.S. in Occupational Safety (3.88 GPA) from smaller D2 school in Pennsylvania
* Never been the best student but I really buckled down in college and found a love for education and worked hard for a good GPA. I credit making it this far in life from common sense and street smarts!
* Part time officer in the Air Force
* Salary: 100K  

   * Project Salary: 125K by age 26 (step 1 promotion)
   * 160K by 30 (step 2 promotion)
   * Both salary projections are with no graduate degree
* Employer: Electrical Power/ Transportation Contractor  

   * 1000ish employees
   * 500 million per year revenue
   * Does not offer continuing education benefits

Goals:

Iâ€™ve always been interested in finances and the business side of the company.

We donâ€™t have a large number of professionals in our career field (Occupational Safety) that peruse advanced degrees so I feel like this would be a great advantage for me.

Iâ€™m mostly interested in an MBA but would also consider a Masterâ€™s of Science.

My idea is this degree would be great to put me on track for a Director position, Vice President, or any equivalent Executive position.

I have the potential to open my own business later on down the road and I also do real estate investing so a program where you have some solid business takeaways is a must.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

Given I may have to pay for this out of pocket Iâ€™m trying to find a balance between a reasonable cost and a program that has a good reputation.

Is this realistic? Or should I just be looking at this as a check in the box and networking opportunity?

I donâ€™t even understand the rankings.

Itâ€™s tough to rationalize when my undergrad is already making me 100K with 50K upside potential over the next 10 years.

Iâ€™ll be working full time in the DC area while perusing this so itâ€™ll have to be a part time or online program.

I will consider doctorate level degrees down the road after.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

Do all programs require the GMAT or GRE?

   * I will acquire one if not two more paid for college educations for my dependents throughout the remainder of my career
   * All budgeting is done through mint/ personal capital

# Gross Income/ Taxes/ Expenses

I have three sources of income: Primary employer, part time military, and my wifeâ€™s contributions

# Income

* Primary employer: $1,545.04/ week - $6,180.16 / month (Gross)
   * Non-taxable Auto Payment: $400 / month
      * I use my own vehicle for work
   * Unlimited fuel card use
   * 3% base pay raise annual across the board
   * Annual bonus of about one weekâ€™s pay per year
* Military: $385.52 / month
* Wife contribution: $720 / month
   * Rent/food

&amp;#x200B;

Gross Monthly Income Total: $7,685.68

# Taxes

* Primary employer: $423.03 / week - $1,692.12 / month
* Military: $87.14/ monthly

&amp;#x200B;

Taxes Total: $1,779.26

# Expenses

* Auto Insurance: $68
* Auto Payment: $250
* Electric: $53
   * Past 6 month average
* Gas Utility: $45
   * Past 6 month average
* Internet: $52
* Cell Phone: $43
* Groceries/ household essentials: $600
   * I realize Iâ€™ll probably get heat here for this being high. I shop at Wegmans which I think has substantially better quality food than say a Walmart. I still go to Walmart for the name brand items that wouldnâ€™t make a difference where you bought them from. Iâ€™ve tried to get the cost down but I just canâ€™t seem to. At the end of the day I consider what I eat to be an investment into my future health and a reward for cutting corners in other areas. Eating shitting can really add up physically and mentally over time.
* Gym: $69
* Home Insurance: $14
* Rent: $1,502
* Spending Money: $400
   * This is everything outside of the mentioned expense categories. Going out to eat, entertainment, amazon purchases, etc. Iâ€™m pretty frugal but usually random things come up (birthday gifts, car maintenance) that dip into this. I usually end up spending most this on a monthly basis but if I donâ€™t I roll it into savings.
* Left over each month: $33.26

&amp;#x200B;

Expenses total: $3,129.26/ month

&amp;#x200B;

* Any large purchases outside of my routine expenses I either plan and save case by case or justify accordingly within means. Example: I donâ€™t usually save up for vacations but I know every few years Iâ€™ll end up spending about $2,500 for me and my wife. Itâ€™s pretty common sense here, donâ€™t go into debt buying it and donâ€™t make a bad purchase whatever it is.

&amp;#x200B;

# Investing/ Net Worth

* My overall strategy has been aggressive buy and hold with a diversified Roth 401K and my Roth IRA in a 500 fund
* A family friend (financial advisor) helped me diversify my 401K and I did my own research on the IRA

**Current Balances**

* Four month emergency fund: $10,000

# Retirement Calculations

* Estimations based off my current track
   * Assumptions:
      * Withdrawal age: 65
      * Rate of return 7%
* Roth 401K value â€“ $5.5 million ($4.2 mil after expenses)
* Roth IRA Value â€“ $1.25 million
* Military Pension Value â€“ 900K to 2.9 mil
   * I realize this is a huge spread but its largely based on how many years I serve, amount of service and rank I retire
* Thrift Savings Plan Value â€“ 485K to 1.2 mil
   * Again, big spread, same as aboveâ€¦
* Social Security â€“ 5K approximately monthly
   * Really not accounting for this much

**Monthly Totals**: By my math, the above values work out to just over **50K per month** when retired at 65 with a 20 year distribution

&amp;#x200B;

# Future Goals

* Overall I realize Iâ€™m in pretty good shape and if I hold this course Iâ€™ll easily be a multi-millionaire by the time I retire
* Worth noting once my wife is employed full time sheâ€™ll be making a similar income to me and following a similar investing strategy. So basically weâ€™ll have double whatâ€™s listed above.
* Obviously like everyone I donâ€™t know what the future holds but Iâ€™ve always seen myself retiring somewhat early (45-55) and enjoying a moderately higher lifestyle from the work Iâ€™ve put in now.
* Sidebar story â€“ Itâ€™s funny but growing up in the lower middle class a friend of mine and myself made a personal goal to make our first million by 30. We still talk about it to this day. This still remains a goal of mine even though I know at my current rate this will be tough.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

1. Continue my natural career progression and capitalize on the high income/ strong investing base Iâ€™ve already build

&amp;#x200B;

2. FIND THE NEXT STEP - I want to focus on aggressively taking the next step to build wealth with this strong base Iâ€™ve listed as my foundation.

* This will most likely be in real estate as Iâ€™ve spent the past year researching/building up capital
   * Having a tough time deciding between investing in the HCOL area of the DMV or go out of town to buy
* Whatever I do in real-estate my general plan is to continue to acquire income producing properties at an exponential rate starting at 1 per year, 2 per year, 4 and so onâ€¦.easier said than done I realize but thatâ€™s the plan
* Most likely me or my wife obtain a real estate license in this process
* Other considerations are once I have enough experience in my field, open a consulting firm or other business venture that I can scale

&amp;#x200B;

3. Lower my taxable liability (*Legally)* â€“ I have little knowledge on this right now but I know this will be a huge advantage to scaling my wealth once I have the ability to do this.

* I know this will really only come into play when I have real-estate or a business of some sort, but Iâ€™m taking steps with an CPA and establishing an LLC so Iâ€™m ready when the time comes

&amp;#x200B;

4. Continue my education with a graduate degree

* This is something Iâ€™ll need to do in order to break into the top tier positions in both my careers, in addition to being a personal goal
* Iâ€™ve already began to scout some better affordable programs such as Oklahoma State or Ball State and at a reach VT or PSB
* My budget is 15-25K out of pocket. The military will help pay for about 10K of this

&amp;#x200B;

5. Open a HSA

* Something else Iâ€™m not very versed in yet but from what I understand my company will match $1500 per year on top of my contribution of $5600 for the $7100 (married couple) annual max
* Is this something good for me?

&amp;#x200B;

6. Backdoor IRA

* Once my wife and I are capped for our IRAâ€™s I want to continue investing via a Roth conversion
* Do any high earners do this? How is it working for you? Or should I be looking at an alternative?

hyxonc,SlowDifference4,"Tricare vs HSA Insurance

Iâ€™m a reserve military member thus Iâ€™m eligible for Tricare Reserve Select insurance. 

The general consensus is this is great insurance with low premium ($230 a month for a family), low deductible ($313 a year) and low co-pays.

 Hi there, im 33 and my net worth is roughly $390k. I have about 150k in cash/liquid (the rest is either invested in ETFs or earmarked for my Emergency / Operating funds). Iâ€™m not great with finances and have no idea how to proceed. 

Iâ€™m considering either a) putting it into the market b) buying a condo/house or c) a mixture of both. I have no idea which direction to go but here are some relevant pieces of info.   


1. I live in Los Angeles

6. I know that I dont have much buying power in the LA market with $150k.
7. Based on my budget, It looks like I can afford to put up to 14k per month into some combo of investments/savings/rent/mortgage payments (depending on how I slice it).

guob77,sm_098,"Invest in my business or elsewhere?

TLDR: I have a nice little cash flow business that generates $300-400k without me being too tied up (though I am definitely involved day to day). Should I try to grow that or take the profit and invest elsewhere (stocks, real estate, buy another business and build that)?

Ive been running a small creative agency for about 5 years. Weâ€™ve grown revenue every year but I have invested very little money in the business â€”itâ€™s been almost entirely organic plus some sweat equity on my part. Im wondering, should I finally invest in the business to try and scale our growth, or should I take profits and invest elsewhere (real estate, stock market, buying a new business, etc).  
 

Here are some important notes

&amp;#x200B;

* We are not doing huge numbers, right around half a million. 
* Margin is pretty high, around 80% if you don't include my salary, around 50% if you do. 
* I have delegated a good chunk of the work but I'm still pretty hands-on day to day. 
* I have avoided making that BIG hire that would likely remove me from the day-to-day because I've been scared to pay someone 100k to do the job properly (20% of our revenue).
* I have a belief (whether itâ€™s true or not) that there is a natural ceiling to the amount of revenue an agency like mine can generate. I know there are massive agencies out there that do millions of dollars, but I don't want to own a 100 person agency. Even if I busted my ass for the next few years I doubt we could get over 1M (versus other types of investments that have a higher return potential)

Potential areas for investment within the business:

&amp;#x200B;

* Spending money on paid advertising 
* Hiring full-time employees who are more qualified therefore removing me from even more of the business ops.
* Freeing up my time to focus solely on getting more work from our current client base or assemble other strategic marketing

So at the end of the day, the way things are I have a nice little cash flow business that generates $300-400k without me being too tied up (though I am definitely involved day to day). Should I try to grow that or take the profit and go elsewhere?",Yes,Yes,No,Yes,Yes
h8zr3m,sm_098,"Doing the hypothetical math on your dream home

I'm trying to work backward and figure out what would need to be the case financially in order to afford my $6M dream home... 

Hereâ€™s where Iâ€™m at, let me know what I'm missing and where I've made bad assumptions!

&amp;#x200B;

**What do I need to be worth?**

* 20% down - $1.2M
* \+ $200k buffer... Not totally sure what this would be for but just in case. 
* \+50K for furnishings
* $1.4M\~ needed
* \*I don't think I'd want to put my entire life savings down so I'll assume that $1.45M  represents maybe 70% of net worth? (Am I off here? Should it be more or less?)
* Net worth = $2.1M *(So at the very least I'd need to have a net worth of $2.1M\~)*

**What would my monthly income need to be?**

Home costs: $28,500 per month

* P&amp;I: $22,858
* Taxes: $3,050
* Insurance: $2,100
* Maintenance: $500

Assuming that my home costs would be max 25% of my income

* 28500x4 = $114,000 per month
* $1.37M per year

Investments / Savings

* I'd still want to dedicate some of my monthly income to savings/outside investments
* However, since the home is partially investment, I'll aim to invest and additional 10% monthly into other investments like the stock market, etc. 
* This 10% would be included in the 75% of my expenses not dedicated to the Home category which I assumed previously, so I wont add it additionally as that is already covered. 

**Outcome**

I'd need to have a *Net Worth of at least $2.1M* \+ comfortably make *$1.37M per year*.

^(Note: I couldn't figure out how to account for the risk of being able to consistently earn $1.34M per year for 30 years. Any ideas on how to account for that?)

Hey everyone, I've really been struggling with the decision to a) rent + invest in stocks or b) buy a home. A strategy has been recommended to me a few times that seems to allow maybe the best of both worlds. I'm trying to get some clarity around as I don't fully understand it, but it does sound intriguing. 

Essentially the concept seems to be:

* Buy something on the lower end (small SFH or Condo)
* Live there for a few years and pay aggressively toward the mortgage to build equity.
* Then at some point (I'm not clear on when this could happen), you borrow against the equity in the home to either a) invest in stocks or b) put a down payment on a bigger home while renting on the first home.

* I live in Los Angeles // 30+ years old
* No family
* Have about 500k in cash/general investments available for whatever I decide to do and can comfortably afford up to 10k per month possibly more if needed.

So my main two questions are:

1. How can I learn more about this process
2. Does this sound like a reasonable strategy?
3. How can I figure out what priced property I should be looking at for the first home? Ideally, id be able to do this with something in the 1M area to start off because everything less than that would be a downgrade from what im renting now.",Yes,Yes,No,Yes,No
onfdgx,sm_098,"Does my retirement savings have to get locked up in a retirement account?

Hi there, my financial advisor says I'm behind on my retirement savings, I have a big lump of cash that needs to be invested and he has directed me to put it into my IRA but I have to admit that I'm a bit hesitant to lock that money up for 30 years.    


Part of me feels like I might be able to get a better return with my money in the active market. Is it totally foolish to take that money and put it into something I can have access to if a good opportunity arises?   


It would still be earmaked for retirement but it would be available/invested capital. Or perhaps, I take 50% and put it into the IRA and 50% goes to something else.

Hi there, I feel like there's a gap in my current portfolio allocations and I was hoping you fine folks might be able to provide some guidance/insight.

*Details: 34 y/o, no family in the works, business owner.* 

Here's how the money is currently distributed:   


* **Cash: 21%** (this is outside of my emergency fund and operating fund so this money is really is doing nothing in cash except maybe waiting for an opportunity)
* **House Down Payment: 41%** (this money is invested at low-medium term risk. 60% bonds 40% stocks &amp; ETFs. Im not even totally sure I want to buy a house but my advisor said if you're considering it in 2-3 years then this is where to put that money)
* **General investing: 21%** (this money is invested a medium-high risk 65% stocks 35% bonds).
* **Retirement: 12%** (this is the one area where I know I don't have enough invested and I'm trying to decide how much I put into this versus another active brokerage)

Glaring gaps: The takeaway for me is a) sitting on too much cash and b) I don't have any higher-risk investments. 

I really dont know much about trading actual stocks so I've avoided it but I have definitely had it on my roadmap for a long time and would like to learn more about it in the near future. 

Would you recommend I take that available cash and put some toward individual stocks? If so, what percentage makes sense?

Hi there, mid 2020 my CPA recommended I up my pay so that I could take advantage of contributing more to my SEP IRA. It was mid-year so this involved some calculations to figure out how I could net out at the correct figure at the end of the year. 

So I went into my Gusto account, made some changes and then sent him the confirmation to make sure it was all correct (I'm not good at math). 

Fast forward to this week when he notifies me that I over-contributed to my IRA because we never hit that target salary figure. He looked into my Gusto account and say that the monthly figure was lower than it was supposed to be AND we somehow missed a scheduled payment, and those two things combined to create the deficit.

So I've learned that my aggressive plans never pan out with my wife and I so I decided to make a conservative plan and wanted feedback.

Salaries (post tax)
Mine: $3500/month
Hers: $4000/month
Commission (me): $200-2000/month
Bonus (me): 500-5000/quarter
Bonus (her): 500/quarter

401k (her): 10%
401k (me): 4%
Roth IRA (me): 6%

Debts
House: 180k (3.5%) 
Car 1: 18k (2.9%)
Car 2: 17k (0.9%)
Student loans (to employer): 2.2k
Federal: 5k

Expenses/bills
House: 1400
Insurance: 150
Cell phone: 130
Utilities: 320
Doggy daycare: 280
Dogs specific diet/Medicines/supplements: 250
Gas: 300
Food: 400

Right now credit cards are zero and staying that way

Current plan:
We pay $1,000/month per car which will pay off both cars within 18 months. My repayment to my previous job for student loans is $250 and my federal is 70. Once my employer is repaid, I will add the 250 to the federal. Any commissions and bonus will go towards paying down student loans.

So we do have some money left over, some goes into savings some goes towards spend and we've been good so far now that credit cards are gone. I've noticed that using debit cards we spend less.

2 year plan:

We will be selling our house. It's a new townhome built in 180 and comps around my neighborhood have sold for 250+. The issue is, the HOA is mandating us to put a deck on by the year 2021 and needs to have one before it's sold. That will cost us 5k, so we will use our tax return and no touch our growing nest egg for that. We will buy a cheaper 80-100k home on a short 15 year mortgage closer to family and use the equity to renovate it (which is ideal because it will keep the taxes down).

At that point, we will also have next to no debt making more than double our expenses and plan to start going on some nice vacations and investing more into retirement. The only downside is, we are right now living decent. We go out to eat twice a week, we will go on 3 mini vacations (costing between 500-800/each) but will be paying for all of them with cash. We will be gifting her sister $1500 as a thank you for her bday for helping my wife our years ago and I am spending $800ish on my wife's 30th birthday. But my goal is to do all of this with cash and using as little savings as possible.

eq0wqn,Snaebakabeans,"How many mortgages can I have?

So here is the idea. In 2 years we will be debt free outside of our mortgage which will have around 180k. Our taxable income is around 135k plus an additional 24k we get from the VA that isn't taxed. I suspect in w years we might have around 40k saved up ontop of emergency funds and a few vacations we want to take.

We plan to move and our house will be worth around 260k, we want to buy a cheap fixer upper and invest 80-100k in renovating it. So I was considering getting a heloc on the current house and get a 15 year mortgage on the new house. Which our income can more than support that. Our take home is around 8900 on average and our current mortgage is around 1400. But the question is, is there anything from a regulation standpoint where I might be stopped from doing this?

This is something I'm hoping my wife is realizing. Even though we are higher income earners (150-160k), every dollar still counts. She asked me the other day why I didn't mind her buying stuff for her switch (we were deep in credit card debt and such before). I said because we can buy things we want, but we need to always consider every dollar. Like she bought the wrong one case for her switch. We were 200 feet down the street at another store and she bought the right one. We went and returned it and got our $10 back. 

That's important. I still am very frugal on the grocery list, we used to let a ton of food go bad, I try to keep the costs down to $125/week for household items and food. When we go out to eat, I always look at the value, if I really like something, I'll spend the money, but often times I get value meals. Now my wife can order whatever, but for me at red lobster last night, I don't LOVE Lobster, so I'm not stopping $35-40 on their specials, I got the $15 special.

We consolidated our subscriptions, based on uses and such. My wife hates ads on YouTube, IDC so we downgraded our YouTube Red. I generally go to McDonalds if I want coffee, it's $1 vs $2-4 at Starbucks/Gas station.

So we are moving soon, downsizing a bit and our mortgage broker recommended a bridge loan. We will probably be a bit short on the necessities if the new house. Our current house is valued around 250k and we owe 185k. The houses we were looking at are in the 160-180k. We are moving to be closer to family and get out of the HOA so we can have a fence. We have a very active dog and our HOA said dogs cannot be off leash anymore even on our property.

But it seems a HELOC would be better. We are doing a VA loan for our next home as my wife is a disabled vet. We net 7.3k a month and our car payments total 1k/month so we have little debt. Any advice?

gqabft,Snaebakabeans,"Order of debts to pay

So we are very lucky that both of us are still working. We've greatly improved our financial situation and turned 70k of income with 90k of debt plus a 200k house to 120-140k of income, 30k of debt with 185k left on the house. But we are tasked with the necessity to move. We built this townhouse in 2016 but the HOA is forcing us out essentially. We have a dog and new rules are fast tracking us to move.


We are in a stupid aggressive sellers market, houses are getting 6-10 offers within 48 hours of listing which is nuts. Our house should list around 260k and we owe 185k. We are looking at houses under 190k. My dad offered us the other day to sell and move in with him which is great.


This is our money situation

Savings: 15k

Car 1: 18k (15 months left)

Car 2: 12k  (8 months left)
Student loans: 8500

Base be income: $7600/month

Base expenses (paying minimums on cars): 4800+food/gas

Wife 401k: 10%

My 401k: 6% (will be upped to 10% after we move)


We were thinking the cars down by paying about 2.5 times the payment to get out of this debt. We should walk away with 50k from the sale.of our house which gives us 65k in savings. Paying off all debt leaves is with about 36k. We were thinking putting up to 10% down on the house (15 year VA loan) if the house didn't need any immediate work and put the rest into the emergency fund.  or if it did keep it and use the 36k to renovate and put the rest into an emergency fund



Does this sound pretty solid?",No,Yes,No,Yes,No
guuy38,Snaebakabeans,"Buying a house right now sucks!!!

So long story short we have to move soon. HOA is being a B about dogs and despite my dog not causing any issues, they are threatening to fine people.

Anyway, our monthly net income is around $7,600 including my wife's VA Disability. I do get nice bonuses but due to COVID-19 that doesn't look likely for awhile. 

We owe 185k on our townhome and my agent is suggesting a list price of 265k. Houses are selling like hotcakes.

The goal is to get a nice older house with a yard and a fence. But here lies the problem. We are bidding on 30-40 year old houses that need work and they are going 20-40k over list. We are trying to stay around 190k which with taxes (we are in PA, so the highest taxes per dollar of any state?) Which puts this mortgage (15 year) close to what we are paying on our 30 year. 

But because of this market, people are way overpaying for houses pushing the prices way over market value. So we are considering building again but these numbers are hard to swallow.

Our current house (townhome)

1842 square foot
3 bedroom
2.5 bath
Paid 210k in 2016
Taxes: $4200/year
Mortgage (30 year 5% down) $1416 with taxes and fees

3 bedroom
2bath
Price: 300k
Taxes: $8,600 (next county over)
Mortgage (15 year with 15% down): $2585 with taxes and fees


The other part of the math is, pay 230-240k for a house, sink 40-50k in it, MAYBE be worth 90-95% of what we put in it and slowly appreciate. Or buy a house for 300k, out down 45k now I owe 255k on a fast appreciating house.",Yes,Yes,No,Yes,Yes

* Moving expenses (twice): $4,000
* 2 Cars: 35k
* College: $1k
* Agents fees: $15k
* Savings: $8k

This gives us 35k left in our pocket while we live with my dad to build a new house.  Our expenses drop significantly 

* House: $1416 (This will increase)
* Car Payments: $1100 
* Utilities: $550 (This drops to $130 temporarily)
* Doggy Daycare: $300 
* Housekeeping: $200 (this will return)
* Student Loans: $250

We should be able to save about another 20k in the 4 months while we are building.  We plan to put down 45k on a new house, VA Loan 15 year 2.75% interest.  Which brings our payments, taxes, etc to $2585/Month and the new expenses look as follows:

* House: $2585
* Utilities: $550

So we are downsizing and should walk away with about 40k in our pockets from our current house. This would alott us enough to pay off both cars and cover closing on the next house.

Currently at 7% we are on pace to have around 2.4 mil. My wife puts 10% into her 401k with a 7% match and I'm doing 4% with a 4% match (cap) and an additional 6% in a roth IRA.

m7z678,Snaebakabeans,"If you're buying a house with plans to move up in house in 5 years, don't buy a house right now.

So all around the country we are seeing horror stories of people unable to buy a house because there are 20 plus offers within 24 hours and people are bidding well over asking price for houses that are already 20 to 30% more expensive than they were just 16 months ago.

What this is going to lead to is in 3 to 5 years when the market does stabilize a lot of these houses, especially older ones will actually have a decent drop in their value. A newer house can expect to appreciate in its first five years but older home is generally appreciate maybe a few percent year over year and a lot of that may have to do with other factors such as the area and school district.

Here's a good example, four years ago we are looking at a split it was completely renovated for $140,000 in my area but we ultimately didn't go with it because the renovation wasn't done that well. We opted to build an 1842 square foot townhome for about 200,000. The houses around us that were built around the same time have sold for close to 300,000 meaning the appreciation has been about 50% in just four years.

The houses that we were looking at in 2016 are now currently selling for around $200,000 to 220,000. But historically you will have seen that over the last 10 years those houses that were selling for 140,000 may have sold for around 110,000 to 120,000 back in 2010.

So what will happen is those houses that sold for $200-220k will probably drop to about 150-170k in a 3-5 years. However people will in 5 years about still owe 180-200k, and be under water unless they put 20% down. However many of these loans are FHA which require much less down.

So when people are looking to move out of their first starter home not only will they have no equity they actually will owe more money on it than when it's worth and be unable to move and expand their family or have to cram more people into house that can't naturally accommodate it.

So people that are desperate for a house and are overbidding for houses that are already overpriced, just note that you will LOSE your butt if you plan on selling in 5-7 years.

Car is being retailed for 26-27k, only 2 within 100 miles because the car is in demand (mine)

My car has all of his maintenance and receipts uploaded to car fax,, garage kept, never smoked and lower mileage for it's year (41k and 2018k). Get to the dealer to do paperwork and they come back at 20k. I'm confused AF, my number was 23k. The ""best"" they could do is 21k. So I walked. I get it, they gotta have the detail department charge them $1,000 to clean it up for sale, but the oil isn't due for another 7k (I changed it every 5k miles despite the book calling for 10k tho). Brand new all seasons and inspection good until end of the year.

So lesson learned, dealers offering cars at MSRP are probably going to lowball the crap out of your trade, they gotta gouge you somewhere!

At the end of last year we paid off my wife's two year old car and we talked about potentially upgrading my car since we have drastically changed our position for the better and now we can finally look to make some more fun decisions and purchases.

I had a few year old VW GTI and i wanted something different. It didn't fit my personality or life style, wasn't as fast as I wanted for the track and lacked all the modern safety and technology features.

So after month of research I settled on a Genesis g70 3.3t all wheel drive sport prestige. It's a little more than what I want to spend but after the wife and I talked it's about a third of our yearly income and we have no debt outside the house and we have fully funded retirements with 10% going into it.

So I spent a month tracking one down to find out that every dealership within 300 miles had all her allocations accounted for in the next four to six months. Finally I got a call one day that dealership had the trim that I wanted coming in and at the previous buyer backed out. They didn't know this but it was also the exact color combination I wanted too.

We talked numbers and they had over 2,300 worth of add-ons that I didn't want and the lowest I can negotiate it down was the $1,400. I wasn't thrilled but it was everything I wanted and I knew that I couldn't just simply say no and find the car and wanted readily available so after they valued my trade out a decent price I put down deposit and wait for the car to come in.

I arrived at the dealership the day after it arrived and when I went in the finance we got into a pretty strong negotiation because they were trying to sell additional add-ons and after it's all said and done I end up paying about $400 less a month and one additional add-on but they bought down the promotional rate the 1.5%. I threatened to walk during the conversation.

Everything's fine dandy until I get a call 2 weeks later saying the paperwork did not go through and I would have to resign. No issues I did and had a week later she told me that they could not get approved below the promotional right at 1.9% and I told her that's fine I will be up this weekend to return the car and to get my car back. She assured me that would not be necessary and that they could discount some things and keep the monthly payment the same and I reviewed the paperwork and signed it and send it back, 1.7% was the rate.

The bank kicked it once again because they were trying to get a rate below the 1.9% promotional rate and I told the finance person that I would be coming up on Thursday to return the car before I go on vacation mind you I have a thousand miles on this car if they don't get this done and approved before I leave.

I got a call for Thursday morning and told me that they could not get below the 1.9% promotional rate and I told her that's fine I'll be out this afternoon and she said no we discounted all the extra add-ons to zero and you'll get the promotional rate in the car at sticker.

So my dad is retired and is looking at moving the remaining of his Hellcat from an auto loan to his heloc. He owns his home owes like 15k on the car (2022 was 88k). He's using most of his free cash investing. His auto loan rate was 4% because right now buying cars sucks. But he secured a heloc about 14 months ago at 2.5%.

I assumed that it would be more expensive to even tho the rates 1.5% lower, but when I ran 15k at 2.5% at 5 years on a mortgage loan, it's identical to an auto loan, thus saving him maybe $10-15/month. He also may use another 15k to replace his daily driver and with auto rates being 4-5% and his heloc is 2.5%, it seems just using his heloc is a better choice.

He's getting a much better rate investing his free cash. Btw he's looking at 48-60 month payoffs. He has around 500k, gets about 2600 from disability and another 500 from another investment account and owns his home.",Yes,Yes,No,No,No

Now given past performance does not indicate anything about future performance I see both sides of the coin

Pros:

Hyperinflation/money being pumped, low bond rates (and expected to be low until 2023 - and still continue)- forcing people to not only borrow money but funnel their funds mostly into stocks.

It says the IRS calculated a tax of $246,289.40  with payments of $221,656.00  leaving an unpaid balance of $ 24633.40 plus what ever interest and penalities

**The ISSUE is on his 2018 transcript**

[https://imgur.com/0YmIVRm](https://imgur.com/0YmIVRm)

It shows the same calculated tax ($246,289.40) HOWEVER payments of $235,897.00 so the amount owed should only be $10392.40.  (the transcript actually recognizes this is the amount owed not the 26k

So if Joe Shmoe made 500,000 in 2020 on his W-2, but lost 90 K in his STANDARD brokerage account (not tax sheltered), is the math just 500,000-90,000=410,000

Congrats all around on a great performance this past year. Cool, I'm happy with that.

I am also supposed to get a 5% bonus each year (per my hire offer) that is also paid out in March. Login to my bank today and I see my raise, but no bonus.

Speak to HR and my boss, and apparently... they stopped doing bonuses, and converted everyone who had one to increased salary. So I didn't actually get a 6% raise. I got a 1% raise. And, the bonus is technically supposed to be for my 2022 work, I got a raise for 2023... so basically I just lost that bonus entirely.

Absolutely no communication to me that my bonus doesn't exist anymore. I had to find out by literally not being paid. The thing that gets me the most is how they presented this as some great raise that I ""earned"" and ""deserved"" for my hard work.

ej2kww,snorkleface,"Some quick advice on spending and a simple tool to help

 

The only way you can cut down your spending is if you *know* what you are spending you money on. Many of us think that we know, but the reality is often very different.

I saw online someone had posted a joke: what if at the end of the year your credit cards gave you a recap of your spending similar to how Spotify does it with your music? ""200 trips to Taco bell"" or ""You spent $150 this year on cheese alone"", etc. That would be a funny yet interesting tool.

Well, they do! You can download your transactions from your credit cards any time you want. A quick pivot chart in excel will tell you more about your spending than you could ever guess or track on your own.

My girlfriend and I would eat out a lot but would always choose the ""cheap"" options ($15-25 for dinner for both of us for example). Little did we know was how fast this adds up up. We were spending close to $800 / month on restaurants! No wonder we couldn't save any money.

(Not to mention, we *thought* we were spending $15-25/meal... average was really more like $30-35. Don't forget to account for tips, and the once-in-a-while $50-60 meals that are twice as much as a normal night).

We stopped eating out as much, started grocery shopping, and realized how much cheaper it could really be. All while still eating really good food, i'm not saying you have to convert to Ramen noodles every day. Neither of us are chefs by any means but google makes it very easy to find simple and cheap meals for one or two.

Any retirement planner/calculator will ask how much you plan on spending in retirement. How can that possibly be calculated? Sure, I might want to make the same amount yearly as I do now. Won't inflation make that number irrelevant? Lets say I'm 30 years old, retiring in \~35 years. If I make $100k now, it might only be worth $40k (relatively speaking) by the time I hit retirement. 

Then of course there's so many other personal factors to consider. If I stay in the same house I'll likely have my mortgage paid off by then. But if I move when I'm 50 (kids are moved out, time to downsize) I might have another 15 years of a mortgage to pay (with whatever property taxes will be like then). 

Just a bit confused on how to approach this without getting too in the weeds.",Yes,Yes,No,No,No

unbh3x,snorkleface,"Reality check - taking out a personal load to partially finish a basement

Looking for someone to tell me I'm not (or am!) crazy for considering taking out a personal loan to partially finish my basement.

Long story short, I'm DIY partially finishing my basement. I do realize I'm picking the worst possible time in the past 30 years to be buying a bunch of materials and hiring out labor, but it is what it is. I need to hire out electrical and plumbing which came out to be way more expensive that I originally planned. Total for both jobs is $15k. 

Citi is offering me $15k, 60months , 10.99% interest. Monthly payment is roughly $325/m.

Unfortunately, my home still has PMI (hoping to get rid of in August of this year) so I believe HELOCs are out of the equation. I also refinanced my house almost 2 years ago and got a 3% rate, so definitely not looking to refi again with rates being double that now. 

Quick budget rundown, my wife and I bring in about $8,400/m after taxes and retirement. We have roughly $4,000 in monthly bills (mortgage, utilities, student loans, car payments, etc.) which does not include our food and other discretionary spending. 

From a budget perspective, I think we can easily afford an extra 300 bucks a month. But am I crazy for considering taking on such a big debt at such a high rate?",No,Yes,No,Yes,Yes

I have the option to either order an appraisal today or in 4 months when my basement finishing project is complete. An appraisal cost $600. My PMI is $200/month.

* Scenario A: Order appraisal today, get approved, done. $600 upfront but Save $200 x 4 months until project complete. **Potential** **Net gain $200.**
* Scenario B: Order appraisal, get denied. $600 + $200 x 4 months. Another $600 for second appraisal. **Potential** **Net Loss $2,000.**
* Scenario C: Wait on appraisal. Pay $200 x 4 months. Appraisal $600. **Guaranteed Net Loss $1,400.**
* Scenario D: Order appraisal, get denied. $600 + $200 x 4 months. Another $600 for second appraisal. Denied again due to market conditions decreasing my value. **Potential** **Net Loss $2,000 + $200 every month.**

104jbcv,SnowShoe86,"New car Affordability check

I am trying to determine how affordable a new vehicle that I am considering is, or, another way, how detrimental to my finances is this new vehicle? It has been a long time since I have personally bought a new vehicle for my use. I am aware of market conditions currently and unwilling to pay any mark ups or addendums for a new vehicle. More on that towards the bottom. 

I want to layout a round numbers idea of our situation; married 36M/37F; one child. 

Household income (husband and wife): $130,000 - $164,000 (part of my compensation is variable commission). For 2022 our gross was about $148K household; need to see where December shakes out at but close enough. 

Total of all accounts including retirement, taxable brokerage, and cash: $1.3m

Portion of that total that is Cash: $200K

We max out our 401K's and Roth IRA's each year, $750 per week into taxable brokerage investments

Mortgage: $245K balance at 2.625%.  PITI is $2000 month (insurance is insane)

Monthly Household Bills (Water, Electric, Lawn service, cable/internet, pest control) $400

Grocery: $500 month

Monthly HOA: $160

Child UTMA, 529, Prepaid College Plan: $300

Car payment wife car:  $415 month.  Approx $13,000 remaining. Rate is 2.99%.  Car has wholesale value of 21k, so not upside down or any rush to pay off or pay faster. 

Insurances (3 Cars, Umbrella Policy) Approx $600 month (we pay in full for a discount, but dividing the total by 12 to come up with a monthly average)

Credit cards: No revolving debt 

No other loans or financial obligations. 

Looking at a Honda CRV Hybrid or Toyota Rav4 Hybrid. Both come to approx $35K. I have found dealerships willing to reserve for me those models at MSRP + tax/tag/etc. 

I would plan to finance for 60 months, and it seems like current rates are hovering around 7%, which has me concerned. 

I would be willing to finance for 48 months if there is a manufacturer backed rate in the 2.9-4.9 range, as there sometimes is offered. I will also check my credit union for rates. 

However, \*for discussion and comparison purposes, in order to work with round numbers\* if we assume 35K price + tax and 7% rate, the Total of Payments is approximately 42K; and it is $700 month for 60 months.  So I'd like to use that $700 month number. 

&amp;#x200B;

I also want to add that I am reimbursed mileage driven for work. This varies but we can say an average of 200 miles per week; or a bit over $120 reimbursed per week.  For a Hybrid Honda or Toyota that leaves approx $100 a week after covering fuel to cover costs/maintenance/depreciation.  Call it $400 a month that I can put towards the vehicle costs.  

\*I would sell the 2006 Honda, not be adding a 4th car to insurance. 

Where does this fit in as far as affordability. Any good rules of thumb to go by? Between money we have, obligations/expenses we have, reimbursables, and the estimated finance scenario how does it all look to the other personalfinance forum members? 

I am open to ideas and suggestions. I am here seeking other perspectives. I respectfully ask that this thread not be derailed or brigaded. This is a potentially huge, significant purchase for me and I am certain there are other like minded individuals out there that are willing to help and that is who I am seeking.

37M; I've had my Roth IRA for many years but didn't starting maxing it out every years until about 10 years ago.

Hi all, so when I started college I calculated the approximate amount of student loans I was going to have to pay back once I graduated. Because of this I made sure 70% of my paychecks from the jobs/fellowships/internships I had since then went towards my ""paying student loans savings account"". I recently graduated and am not entirely at my savings goal yet. I owe 10,500 and I've saved 7,000 so far.

However, my parents out of the blue told me that they may be able to pay the remainder off which I am so grateful for.

I was not expecting that offer but am going to take it (def plan on repaying them as soon as I can).

Hi all,

So I  did two dumb things. During my last call (before the offer letter), I said I was happy with the salary and I would like to accept the offer. This morning, in an email I got from my soon-to-be boss, I said I would send over the offer letter signed this afternoon. Got the offer yesterday and had till Dec 1st. Ahh...why did I do that.

During the phone screen, I was told the salary range would be from 43-45,000$. I was getting ready to negotiate for 45,000 when my manager said I'd be getting that.

This position is remote and I am lucky that I will be able to live with my parents for a few months. I would like to move to Boston where the HQ for this org is but idk if 45,000 is sufficient for that. 

Is it too late to negotiate? How would I even do it? It's for a Global Health nonprofit. If I don't negotiate now, will I be able to a year after when I have more valid reasons for a salary raise as a result of my work?

Hi all,

I am a recent graduate and just started this job on monday. I am single and live in CA, and am a dependent under my parents. So my work uses this system called Trinet for onboarding and providing tax information. The last time I was onboarded it was in person and I remember I had to choose between putting 0 and 1 and have no idea if that was related to state taxes or federal, but it was all done on paper. 

I think on Trinet, you are able to put your withholding info and so for CA my withholding was 0, and then for some reason, my federal said N/A. I think I may have had the chance to edit it intially but I accidentally didn't.  If I go back to edit it makes me fill out a W4 form but it seems like it's a W4 that ""changes"" my witholding. I have no idea what is going on and am so confused.

On Trinet it basically is a chart that looks like this

Type                                                       Tax Filing Status                                Witholding 

|Federal|Single |N/A|
|:-|:-|:-|
|CA State|Single, or Married w...|0|

All I know is that I would like to **have the maximum amount of tax taken out now so I or my parent don't have to pay later.** I don't mind receiving a lump sum later. Hence why I have always put zero in the past.  

So looking at this, should I edit and submit a W-4 or leave it as is? Is having ""N/A"" on Trinet concerning? I'm not getting any assistance from my work and I have been struggling to get a hold of our tax person. 

Thank you!",Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes
rpt1by,soniya42423,"I make 45K and work remotely from my parents' home. I live with an extremely abusive/toxic mother, should I fight it through or move to DC/Boston closer to my work offices?

Hi all.

So everyone, including my older extended family members of mine have been encouraging me to move out. I have an immigrant mom who is just another level insane, similar to a lot of the moms described in /r/asianparentsstories. A few examples is she won't let me see a gynocologist, get my wisdom teeth removed, she herself refuses to get boosted and barely got the vaccine by getting J&amp;J, cries when she doesn't get her way, and during really awful situations when she hears sometime she doesn't want to hear, will cry and ask me or my dad to kill her lol (a lot of south asian moms are like this). I am also not allowed to date people who aren't indian. She also gives the silent treatment a lot which is the worst, not to mention she is a hoarder and even my neighbors have expressed concerns. I have a decent relationship with my dad but he just chooses to tolerate my mom and stays silent.

I just graduted from uni this past June. I was going to apply to grad school my senior year but was too busy helping my parents find jobs after they both lost their jobs as a result of the pandemic. I graduated with a dual degree in poli sci:ir and global health. I had a very difficult time getting a job and just got one this month. I probabaly applied to around 120 jobs and only heard back from 2. I knew what I was getting myself into when I decided to not major in a STEM but I am very passionate about my line of work and feel like in the longrun I will be pretty succesful in it, so long as I keep up with my network, work hard, pursue more school, get more experience. I am now working for a non profit focused on global health.

I did do a really stupid thing of not negotiating my salary. I was so over the job hunting process I just said yes to it when I got my verabl offer. I \*deeply\* regret this and know I let my fear get to me. While I've lived in a low income household pretty much my whole life in So Cal, I know moving to a city like DC or Boston is extremely unrealistic with 45k. At the same time, I don't own a car and feel like a city with public transportation is my best bet.

I am applying to grad schools at the moment but think I will defer for a year, should I get into my top program since I do like the work I am doing at my current job. I only will attend grad school if I get sig financialaid or if I am allowed to TA and makeup for the tuition fees. I would like to have an MPP.

If I did move, I do plan on having roomates and would honestly be very alright with also splitting a room with someone.

rpt6bq,soniya42423,"I make 45k through my remote job and live with my parents. My mom is very abusive and toxic. Should I move to DC or Boston, closer to our offices, or fight it out another year?

Hi all.

So everyone, including my older extended family members of mine have been encouraging me to move out. I have an immigrant mom who is just another level insane, similar to a lot of the moms described in r/asianparentsstories. A few examples are she won't let me see a gynecologist, get my wisdom teeth removed, she herself refuses to get boosted and barely got the vaccine by getting J&amp;J, cries when she doesn't get her way, and during really awful situations when she hears sometimes she doesn't want to hear, will cry and ask me or my dad to kill her lol (a lot of south Asian moms are like this). I am also not allowed to date people who aren't Indian. She also gives the silent treatment a lot which is the worst, not to mention she is a hoarder and even my neighbors have expressed concerns. I have a decent relationship with my dad but he just chooses to tolerate my mom and stays silent.

I just graduated from uni this past June. I was going to apply to grad school my senior year but was too busy helping my parents find jobs after they both lost their jobs as a result of the pandemic. I graduated with a dual degree in poli sci:ir and global health. I had a very difficult time getting a job and just got one this month. I probably applied to around 120 jobs and only heard back from 2. I knew what I was getting myself into when I decided to not major in a STEM but I am very passionate about my line of work and feel like in the long run I will be pretty successful in it, so long as I keep up with my network, work hard, pursue more school, get more experience. I am now working for a nonprofit focused on global health.

I did do a really stupid thing of not negotiating my salary. I was so over the job hunting process I just said yes to it when I got my verbal offer. I \*deeply\* regret this and know I let my fear get to me. While I've lived in a low-income household pretty much my whole life in So Cal, I know moving to a city like DC or Boston is extremely unrealistic with 45k. At the same time, I don't own a car and feel like a city with public transportation is my best bet.

I am applying to grad schools at the moment but think I will defer for a year, should I get into my top program since I do like the work I am doing at my current job. I only will attend grad school if I get sig financial aid or if I am allowed to TA and make up for the tuition fees. I would like to have an MPP.

If I did move, I do plan on having roommates and would honestly be very alright with also splitting a room with someone. I just feel like it is very rare to find people my age who are looking to share a room. I did share rooms with my roommates in college, and honestly had such a good experience and felt like I was saving a lot of money.

I also don't want to be in a situation where I have to move back home, that is my worst fear. I'd rather save up for a year and fight it off and then leave knowing I never have to look back.

Hi all,

So I am a recent grad who started working for a nonprofit. My boss and org have been so sweet and understanding. But I can't help but feel so incompetent and just so out of place. I have been making so many careless mistakes digitally, it is so embarrassing.  I am on an annual salary and my signed hours are from 7-3 pm. I get a 30 minute paid lunch. My job is remote.

What I have been doing for the past two months since I started was logging my hours as:

7-12:00 PM Work

12-12:30 PM Meal

12:30-3:00 PM Work

My boss reached out to me today telling me that we have paid lunch and that I should use it and I was confused cause I always clock in my lunch and she approves them. She then told me she only sees my hours logged as 7-3:00 PM/8 hours. I then told her how I logged time and I haven't heard back. I know she saw my message.

I am FREAKING out. Was I supposed to be working 8 hours a day and then get a 30-minute lunch break, is that lunch break not included in the 8 hours? I am literally gonna start crying, this new job and professionalism have been so stressful. I wish I can talk to my parents about this but they both work minimum wage jobs on the hour and don't get paid lunch. I am so scared. Idk if it's cause I am the first in my family to work a professional job, but I feel like this transition has been so much harder for me than my peers. I don't know if I can do it.

Hi all,

So I am a single 22-year-old who makes 45k without taxes. I just got my first full-time job on  December 7th of 2021. During onboarding, I accidentally selected N/A when filling out the federal allowance portion of the form. It was not directly a W4 form but a form on a portal my workplace used to get tax info. For state allowances (CA), I put 0. My tax lady was recommending that I put 0 on all slots and told me to refill a W4 form (I'm guessing she noticed something wrong from my W-4 with my income only being for December for the 2021 tax filing season).

I am confused because the 2022 W4 on my workplace portal asks me to checkmark a box where I have to claim exemption. I don't know if I should be doing that? 

Ideally, I want them to take as much taxes out now so I minimize what I pay out of pocket when filing next year. I am also confused by what my tax lady meant because I do get around $147 in federal taxes taken out each paycheck. I am confused and quite frankly freaking out.

ug95cj,soniya42423,"Two fraudulent purchases on my CC, BoA seemed to have fixed things by deactivating and reissuing new CC, but is there anything else I should do moving forward for additional security?

Hi all,

Backstory: I used this QR code generator for a nonprofit I volunteered for but the head wanted me to get a subscription so they could use an expired QR code I made for a fundraiser.  I had this bad gut feeling about saying yes to getting the subscription from this website (which I expressed) but she venmo'd me the cost prior. She sounded super urgent and she was on her way to an event where she needed to have the QR code so I said ""screw it...what are the odds"" and put in my credit info. As soon as I processed the payment, I got a fraud text alert from BoA (my bank) asking if I made the purchase. It was weird cause the text alert showed two payments of $119. I was only supposed to pay $9.99. So immediately I responded 'no' this was not my purchase and then got a notification saying my BoA CC was deactivated. I logged back on to the BoA app and filed these claims as fraudulent. And then the BoA app said they are issuing me a new card in 5-7 business days and giving me a new account number. I logged back on and saw the last four digits of my new account number and my own balance prior to this purchase, travel rewards points are still there.

I think for the most part this new card/account should solve the situation and protect me from credit card theft, but are there any other added steps I should do for security? 

Also, will this hurt my credit score? I have always been good at paying my cc bills on time and in general, am very cautious with my finances and identity (I just let the pressure get to me this time). I do plan on speaking with a BoA advisor in person tomorrow.

Thanks for your help!

uxzgik,soniya42423,"Is it safe to use sell to pay for a 2-month sublet? I have never used Zelle before

Hi all, so in general I am very cautious about how I pay for things, especially online due to scams etc. I am a recently admitted grad student at a school in DC and am looking to spend the summer there for about two months before I commit. I found a sublet from a fellow student on the university's housing FB group. She seems to be legit, is a med student, and has been providing me videos and details about the space, roommates etc. We are having a video call tomorrow so she can show me the place and answer any more questions. (I wish I could visit in person but I am back home on the west coast).

I asked her what platform they use to pay for rent. She said they usually use Zelle but that she is fine with Venmo if they don't charge a fee (we both haven't done large transactions on Venmo before). I have had friends who have used Zelle (in a way similar to how they use Venmo) and I personally use Zelle to transfer in between my own banks. I would prefer to use venmo since it is not connected to my BoA app.

How secure is using Zelle in this instance? I don't 100% know her and have never used zelle to send money to others. Should I stick to Venmo (which is what I have done with my own sublets in the past but my rent was only $800 at the time)? This would be a two-month lease while she is away for summer break so I would not be directly paying the landlord. Any insight or advice would be great! Any red flags here?

So, yeah, I think I did something a little bit problematic. A major car dealership in the region has an annual show Plus giveaway. They mail out flyers to everyone with a scratch off prize code that tells you that you won a prize, listing the standards of a big prize that you know you're not going to win and a bunch of other smaller prizes including a cash prize of up to $100, which in fine print means $5. The odds listed on the brochure basically tell you that you're going to win something, generally $5. This is, of course, to get people in. So, I figure that, since my flyer says somebody else's name or current resident, I'm fine. Wander over, person sees me with the flyer, and just says they have to get a little bit of personal information just in case I win the big one. I give only my first name. The flyer has the location where I live, and I tell the gentleman that I'm not interested in buying car and won't be for likely another 8 to 10 years. Most of the paper, he leaves blank.

At the bottom, he asked me to sign, and I scribble out the line underneath that says authorizing credit check and wrote no credit, and I did not include a last name at all.

My parents (60+ but semi retired) wish to buy another property (They already live in one) to take advantage of the potential housing price reduction timed with the reduced interest rates.

They expect to keep the house for another 10 to 20 years, and are mainly using it as a means to rent and get extra income. Loan term would probably be 15 years.

Since their actual income and hence their DTI ratio is limited these days, they want to add my name to the loan. I do not own a house and i just started working, and I do not expect to buy a place of my own for another 4 to 5 years. They are doing this so that they can actually get a bank approval.  I have no intention of moving to their location where the house will be (east coast but im in west coast). They say that this will reduce my tax burden, and i will be able to have some equity extra too in 20 years.

Hi,
Two different questions. Feel free to answer one or both questions as they are very different.

1. Does it make to sell a stock for a loss for the deduction and then buy it one month later (whenever it's allowed to avoid the wash rule) for a similar price even if you think it will go up in a few years? Is the deduction from the loss worth more than the tax you will need to pay on the gain when it goes back up?

For numbers, assume 3k loss. The gain in a few years would be 3k at effective income tax bracket of 32%. Assume 20% capital gains or 25% if you want.

2. Can someone make a good argument for why I should have any bonds in my portfolio at all? I am currently 100% equity, with a 20 year retirement timeline. I don't touch money on downturns. Bonds fall less in down turns but they also don't make as many gains in good years and with recoveries as stocks. I am not referring to TIPS or series I bonds, but corporate bonds.

loab6g,spicyboi15,"Paying off lower interest debt make sense to lower monthly payments in near-term?

Iâ€™ll try to keep it short. I have around 20k in private student loans at ~6% interest whose minimum payments are in the range of $260/mo though I am currently paying around $350/mo to pay them down faster. I have 16 monthly payments (around 5k total, ~3% interest) left on my car that was bought in 2016. I am projected to receive a large amount of money back on my taxes which I have already filed and accepted.  My plan is to apply all of my return towards my debt. 

Though my loans are of higher interest and I â€œloseâ€/save less by paying off my car in full in the long run as opposed to the alternative. I think it makes more sense to free up more net income immediately than to save what I have calculated to be around $2-300 in additional interest over the next 16 months by paying the loans instead of the car? My question is if there is anything that I may be overlooking in this situation particularly if anything changes in terms of insurance or anything once a vehicle is paid off entirely? Any general advice is also appreciated.

lvbkam,spicyboi15,"Is it really worth getting an IRA when you already have a 401k for someone who currently is a beginner investor?

As title says. Iâ€™ve recently been trying to get more into investing and finance. Due to the way my company auto bumps up contribution % with annual raises I am contributing 9% to my Roth 401k with a capped 6% match for a combined 15% total. Iâ€™ve been reading up on IRAâ€™s and how the general rule is max your 401K to contribution limit (6%) and then put all the rest towards IRA. The benefit being the IRA is more flexible in what you can invest in and and be written off on taxes? - correct me if Iâ€™m wrong. But my question is for someone who doesnâ€™t really know what to invest in and whoâ€™s 401k or primarily just target funds atm is there really any benefit to the IRA until I learn more?

mfwns1,spicyboi15,"Private student loan refinancing

Probably a stupid question... but Iâ€™m wondering about the possible negatives or things Iâ€™m overlooking in my situation. 

Basically, I for whatever reason took out private student loans by the semester (till my final year) so I in total had 7 loans. Iâ€™ve been aggressively paying them off but still have 4 left totaling around 20k at ~6.7% interest. I also have 21k in public which is in forbearance but appears to be at 2.75% when it resumes? My minimum payment is currently $260 on just the private but Iâ€™ve budgeted to be able to throw about $1,000 at it per month, or 4x the payment and hopefully get it done by end of 2022 at the latest.  

Iâ€™ve been checking out refinancing the private loans and have been quoted 3.87% for a 5-year loan with minimum payments being around $370. Mathematically it obviously makes sense NOT to include the public in this refinance and that I can well afford the monthly payments (will still be doing 2.5-3x min payments). Is there anything that I may be overlooking here? It might sound stupid but is it worth refinancing for a *relatively* small debt that will be paid off very quickly? I am not sure if there are fees involved or if this affects taxes any? By my math this saves just about $700 in the loan lifetime if I am to pay $1000/mo towards it with the reduced rate.

Hey guys, simple post here. I am getting really into PF and investing, budgeting, etc. While I know there are programs out there that do niche things better (I.e mint for budgeting, etc) Iâ€™ve recently taken up creating a consolidated spreadsheet guide for things related to PF that is easy to use and customizable. Currently it has the following:

- Budgeting including category breakdown, % of take home, % of expenses, budget comparisons (if you are planning to move or be promoted soon for instance), and emergency fund duration.

- total retirement contributions including traditional and Roth 401k, IRAâ€™s, HSAs, ESOP, etc. with calculated current and future values based on % individual and company contributions and assumed current and future tax brackets for chosen retirement year.

- Debt plan / efficiency calculator (how much is going to interest instead of principal with your current payment plan and how long itâ€™ll take to payoff if you pay X more)

- Near-Term financial planner. Currently includes the current and next month with inputs for reoccurring monthly bills, and irregular expenses so that things can be planned without going into debt in the near future between paychecks.

I plan to grow this spreadsheet more and refine it over the next couple months until it is ready to be shared with friends, family, and the PF subreddit to hopefully benefit people and help get them a better handle on their finances and to learn more.

Very simple question and probably a bit silly. I understand the differences between Roth and traditional in terms of when taxes are paid. But say for example, I earn $50,000 and my tax rate is 20%. If I choose to contribute 6% to retirement that would be $3,000 a year. Negating the tax breaks, deductions, etc. if I choose traditional then obviously the entire $3,000 goes to my retirement account and I pay the 20% later on (assuming same tax bracket). However, my question is if I do Roth now will be actual contribution be $2400 as the taxes are taken out before being put in, or do I pay extra so that AFTER tax my contribution is 6% I.e $3,000?

p2dc6b,spicyboi15,"Investing part of emergency fund?

I know investing your EF gets asked 100 times a day and the resounding answer is that itâ€™s not meant to make money, itâ€™s meant to be a blanket ICE fund. That depreciation is the opportunity cost of protection.

I have an EF of 3-4 months saved up (5K ish) on top of a minimum balance of 1-1.5K I typically leave in my checking as a sort of mini-emergency fund for smaller emergencies outside of job loss, etc. Itâ€™s a peace of mind thingâ€¦

Given that collectively my on-hand cash-in-bank-accounts is actually closer to 4-5 months expenses is it semi-reasonable to instead invest a portion of this (say 2-3k) in a taxable brokerage account as a form of half investment half E-Fund in the event a serious emergency did happen? I would have more than enough instantly available outside of these investments to cover anything that may happen for 1-2 months allowing time to cash out these investments, if needed.

My wife (29) and I (33) have been married for 8 years and have rented apartments our entire marriage and working aggressively to get out of debt. We recently got out of debt and are saving as much as we can for a home and were curious when we should realistically buy a home.

* We live in the midwest were you can get a nice home for around 150k.
* Within the last 6 months, we both received nice pay raises
* Salary: $92,000 (combined salary before taxes). We also have a small business on the side where brought in about 30k last year before taxes and we expect it to be similar this year.
* Debt: We currently have zero debt
* We own two cars, both paid off. One car is 20 years old and may need replaced in a couple years but we are going to see how long we can keep her running
* We have about $25,000 in the stock market (house fund), $18,000 in our 401k and $7,000 in an emergency fund
* We put $1,000 a month into our house fund and $750 a month into our 401k
* We will not be having children
* We just recent paid off my student loans
* We are currently living very cheap for $400 a month (that includes utilities)
* We want a 15 year mortgage
* My credit score is 748

While our rent is very cheap, we don't hate where we live now. While we'd like our own place, where we currently live is fine for the time being and we aren't itching to leave right this second.

Based on our financial situation, when should we expect to realistically move out? I love having our expenses be so cheap, but I donâ€™t want to live here forever.

Weâ€™d like to have a house in the 170-200k range as that would put us in a nice home for our area.

Based on how much we have in our house fund and how much we are adding to it each year, we can expect to have 37k in a year, 49k in two years and 61k in three years. This doesn't include adding any of our side business money to that each year, which will probably be, at minimum, 10k a year. So we could realistically have 91k in our house fund in three years.

-We currently have two cars - one is a 2001 Ford sedan and one is a 2013 Kia sedan. The Ford has 102k miles and the Kia has 96k. Both seem to be running perfectly fine at the moment

-We are maxing out two 401ks each month 

-We have about 60k total in retirement (across all accounts) 

I guess my question is, should we be buying a home right now based on the low interest rates? Weâ€™ve been waiting (for no particular reason), but I hate to wait a couple years and then see interests rates jump up another 1.5% and then us lose money in the long run. We have some friends looking for a home right now and theyâ€™ve put in offers over asking price and didnâ€™t get it, so our small market isnâ€™t immune to whats happening everywhere. 

We are adding about $3,000 a month to our house fund, so Iâ€™m not sure if itâ€™s worth it to just keep saving and living cheap or go ahead and buy. 

Any suggestions or recommendations?",Yes,Yes,No,Yes,No
qg9inz,spydervenom,"How can I afford to buy a house, car and fund retirement?

My wife and I (30, 34) are considering buying a house but after doing the math, it seems really difficult to wrap my head around. 

This may seem like a silly question based on the numbers below, but how can I possibly afford these things? 

House Cost: Looking for something between 180-220k

Salary: $130,000 pre-tax (this includes two of our side businesses, so this number will likely decrease as we feel burnt out by one of them). This time next year I could see that number dropping by $20,000

Savings: $132,000 - this includes our emergency fund and house fund. We are adding about $3,000 a month to this account currently

Rent: $400 total (including utilities). We currently live really cheap and actually donâ€™t mind where we live, which is why we arenâ€™t in a rush to leave. 

Credit Score: Anywhere between 776-802 depending on what service I look at

Location: Midwest, small market 

Here are a few small pieces of info that could be relevant 

-We currently have two cars - one is a 2001 Ford sedan and one is a 2013 Kia sedan. The Ford has 102k miles and the Kia has 96k. Both seem to be running perfectly fine at the moment

-We are maxing out two 401ks each month 

-We have about 70k total in retirement (across all accounts) 

Now all of that sounds like we are in an okay financial situation and maybe in paranoid but hear me outâ€¦

If we buy a house on a 30 year loan, our mortgage would around $800-900 a month. This obviously doesnâ€™t include utilities, taxes, repairs, etc. 

We currently put $1000 a month from our paychecks into retirement accounts. 

We currently put $1,000 a month from our paychecks in savings (we put an additional $2,000 a month from our side business, but we likely wonâ€™t keep that up for too much longer so I donâ€™t want to count that).

So doing the math on buying a houseâ€¦take our $400 rent currently and probably triple it for our housing costs so thatâ€™s $1,200 a month.

We are saving $1,000 a month so now that savings will go toward our mortgage and we would have $200 left over (400 + 1,000 - 1,200 = 200) 

So that means we would be saving $200 a month. Now what happens when we want to buy a car? I feel like we are in a better financial situation to not just buy a beater, but I donâ€™t see where the rest of the money comes from in the budget. 

Yes we have an emergency fund and we have a nice pot of savings, but I donâ€™t see how a house and a car payment fits into our day to day budget. 

We shouldnâ€™t contribute less to retirement right? That seems like the wrong move. 

Am I missing something?",Yes,Yes,No,Yes,Yes
s37hu1,spydervenom,"I max both a Roth and Traditional IRA each year. Should they both be Roth?

xf41tl,spydervenom,"Pull Money out of Market for Down Payment or Leave it?

I am moving for a job in a different state in the next month or two. For the last several years, my wife and I have been saving for a downpayment, but knew we wouldn't be buying anytime soon. Knowing we had time, in March of 2020 we put that entire downpayment into some mutual funds (VTI, VOO, etc). As we kept getting paid, we kept putting more into the market because of the potential of growth. 

Long story short, it did really well. Over the course of a year and a half, we put in a total of 87k in and at one point last year it was up to 120k. Today it's at 98k. 

So now I have a job opportunity that I have accepted and we are looking to buy a house (between 200-240k). Should I put down a very small amount like 3% or should I pull money from my mutual funds for 20%? I hate to pull it out when it's already down, but I hate to pay PMI.

107q1fm,srekai,"Should I be making more Roth IRA contributions if I want to retire early?

Today, I max out my 401K and HSA contributions for $22500 and $2850, along w/ a 50% employer match on top of that, and I save up an additional 30k annually beyond that in a mix of HYSA and stock/ETF investments. I have a small Roth IRA with a few thousand that I have not actively managed.

I am in my early 20s, aiming for early retirement around the age of 40 with the goal of having 2 to 2.5M saved up overall to tide me over until I can start withdrawing from 401k at 59 1/2 and SSN later on. With my current housing plan, I aim to have my mortgage paid off by then, so my net expenses should be drastically lower by that age.

Because I want to retire early I have not made many Roth IRA contributions, however, I found out today that my employer also matches 50% on Roth IRA. Which means in theory, I should be contributing the limit of $6500 a year, for an additional $3250 of ""free"" employer match. But if I understand correctly Roth IRA also has a 10% penalty for early withdrawal before 59 1/2.

Basically, is the 10% penalty worth taking for the extra 50% employer match? Or should I keep all/most of my savings outside of the Roth IRA? Are there other considerations/penalties that I'm not aware of if I take money out of the Roth IRA early?

Edit: thanks everyone for the comments, I had confused Roth 401K with IRA, regardless, it seems like the right thing to do is to max contributions to the Roth IRA regardless. I opened up an account this afternoon and backdated the contributions to max out the 2022 contributions",Yes,Yes,No,No,No
109yw0d,srekai,"Roth IRA limits based on MAGI

Does stock award income count towards MAGI? I'm assuming it does.

I had figured I could contribute to my Roth IRA based on my taxable salary which is under the 138k limit for 2022. But I also received a bonus and stock awards that put me over the 153k limit. 

I already put in 2k into my Roth IRA with the intent to max it out by April 18th this year for 2022 contributions.

I'm assuming I should stop doing that, but how do I properly withdraw my contributions to the Roth IRA without paying a penalty? And what do I do instead, rollover the Roth into a Traditional IRA?

Honestly seems a little unfair that they don't let everyone contribute to Roth IRAs when the income difference isn't even that high. Just 15k and then all of a sudden you can't.",Yes,Yes,No,Yes,Yes
10aizy4,srekai,"Should I be doing a traditional IRA, Roth IRA, or something else if my MAGI exceeds the contribution limits and I max out 401k contribution?

So, these past few days have been very learning for me.

* I learned that contributing to a Roth IRA can be very beneficial since the earnings are tax free
* So then, I setup a Roth IRA and started contributing for 2022
* But then I found out that I can't actually make contributions to it since my MAGI exceeds the limits
* I learned that instead I can either do a traditional IRA or do a backdoor Roth conversion
* My family said that since I am maxing out my 401k contributions, then I cannot receive the tax deductible on IRA contributions, which seems to be correct. So they said, I should just be investing my money in savings/brokerage vs an IRA at all
   * My thought process was that regardless of tax deductible or not, Roth IRA has the benefit of tax free earnings and the ability to take out contributions before 59 1/2 if I've waited 5 years?

Who is correct here? Should I listen to my family and only invest in standard savings/brokerage or is the backdoor Roth IRA conversion still worthwhile?",Yes,Yes,No,Yes,No

So I made direct Roth IRA contributions despite being over the income limit, so I need to convert that back to a traditional IRA before proceeding with my backdoor conversion. I have left my traditional IRA in cash until I sort things out so that the backdoor conversion can work out.

I already invested my assets in the Roth IRA. And I already have a traditional IRA as well. Do these pose any complications in getting my Roth IRA converted back?

If so, what should I do to smooth out the process? Should I sell off my Roth IRA assets before trying to recharacterize?",Yes,Yes,No,Yes,No
10onkvz,srekai,"When to flip the switch on retirement age?

This might seem like a dark question, but dying is inevitable. And no one really knows how long they're going to live. And we do all this work to save up money so we can retire, but you also can't spend money when you're dead.

This might be more of a subjective rather than objective question. But how do you all decide around retirement planning for life expectancy. For example, you can get more SSN benefits per month if you wait a few years between retiring at 67 vs 70. However, if you're not going to live much longer beyond 70, then taking the benefit earlier is always better. And the same conundrum follows. You might need hundreds of thousands of dollars to live through your 70s, but you could also die in your 60s which is not unlikely.

With how the pandemic, I've sort of felt time has become an even more valuable commodity to me, and I want to make sure I'm maximizing my time and life for that reason.

Of course you don't want to end up in a situation where you don't have any money when you're extremely old and unable to work anymore.

But it really does beg the question how do you decide what is optimal? Or are we all just planning for the worst/longest case scenario?",Yes,Yes,No,Yes,No
10s3hb2,srekai,"What's considered living paycheck to paycheck?

There's a lot of these vague terms thrown out a lot of the time like being house poor and so forth. What do you all define to be living paycheck to paycheck? I ask this because I saw some recent threads discussing how the more people earn the more they spend. Which is totally true. There are supposedly plenty of rich individuals living paycheck to paycheck. But what that does actually mean.

For example, because I max out all these pre-tax contributions and other savings/investing areas, my actual take home is very low. I would say my monthly take home just about covers exactly how much I spend on necessities like food, housing, etc.

I only ever keep about a month to two months of expenses in my checkings. Is this considered living paycheck to paycheck? If I missed a month of salary, I wouldn't really be able to cover those expenses without dipping into my savings/emergency fund.",Yes,Yes,No,Yes,No
1117kzc,srekai,"Inflation Reduction Act eligibility

I would like to move to an induction stove at my current home. I have gas right now, and I personally have qualms about using an open-burner, not to mention it is supposedly not healthy for you due to the fumes. (the only upside to this is that gas is covered in my HOAs right now).

The way that I understand the inflation reduction act is that it comes in two parts.

* Up to $4000 tax credit
* Rebate for a % of the cost

I believe anyone can get the tax credit, but the rebate is the tricky portion for me. The act reads: ""More than 80 percent but less than 150 percent of the HHI in your area, you get 50 percent of the cost of the new appliance.""

How is eligibility based on income defined?

* My assumption is that this is based off of your AGI? (or is it MAGI)?
   * This would make a difference since there are large deductions I can take to reduce my MAGI
   * My AGI is almost certainly higher than 150%, but there is a world where I can drop my MAGI into that range.
* How is ""in your area"" defined?
   * I looked up this website: [https://www.huduser.gov/portal/datasets/il.html](https://www.huduser.gov/portal/datasets/il.html)
   * And it provides median income based on county, would this be correct? Or is there a different way to verify eligibility?",Yes,Yes,No,Yes,Yes
11af1pn,srekai,"Is it worth paying down all CC balances immediately for credit score?

I always pay off the full statement balance every month on time. However during the month I due accumulate enough balance in the thousands that will increase my total usage percentage by a few percent.

I know those free credit score estimators aren't wholly accurate, but I see anywhere between 5 to 20 point increases/decreases based on these fluctuations in usage.

Is there any long-term effect of carrying the balance until the statement cycle ends?

13m8xxp,srekai,"Should I apply for this credit card while planning to refinance in the next year or two?

Hi all, I was looking at some Amex offers for their cards, and they have some special pre-qualification  bonuses, where the Amex Gold card will give 90k points instead of the usual 60k, which I think is a good deal.

My only qualm is that applying for it adds another hard inquiry onto my report, which will lower my credit score for the next year or two as it stays on my report. In general, I have "" very good"" credit, in the mid to high 700s range, but I'm worried taking this out would drop be in the ""good"" range, which could affect the refinancing rates a bit. I know that from talking to my loan officer in the past, it can affect how much you end up paying for points and the overall rate.

In my mind, since home loans are a 15 to 30 year ordeal, which is much longer term, the value is of course higher. But it's hard to rationalize due to the immediacy of the signup bonus.

Am I overindexing on this one hard inquiry, or should I just wait it out and apply for the bonus after refinancing next year?",No,Yes,No,Yes,Yes

My current rate is at 5.5% for a 30 year fixed and I'm in my first year of payments. Given the current market and savings rates, would I be better off putting the extra payments towards the mortgage or investing the surplus?

I know that early on I'm just paying interest so my thought is that it would be good for paying down the principal to keep my options flexible for resale or refinancing in the next few years. But also market conditions look like it's a great time to put money into HYSAs, CDs, and the market.

zyr7v3,srekai,"Should I only ever hold my money in the markets?

The general advice has always been to keep your money invested in the market for the long term since the S&amp;P has provided an average of 10% returns annually.

But since the economy is also cyclical, there are downturns and upswings. Obviously it's very hard to know when these occur and by how much in the present.

However I'm wondering if it's worth trying to capitalize on the momentum swings up and down to exceed the average gains. For example, we had a pandemic boom followed by a huge drop off. Had someone sold near the peak and then reinvested now, they would be getting almost 25% more during this period compared to purely holding.

I know that selling your assets at a profit also has tax implications. But the essence of my question remains. Is it worth trying to analyze the market dips to achieve this? Is it too difficult for a layperson that doesn't invest full-time to accomplish this?",Yes,Yes,No,No,No

Backstory: parents moved overseas after father got his retirement. she waited another year to apply because her age ( 2021). 

At some point SS asked for a her citizenship certificate to verify her? we spent 3 months calling the embassy, sending emails. Nothing the embassy was closed because covid... so she miss the date to bring her document and got denied. and the 60 days to appeal just passed 2 days ago. I heard the embassy is open again.

vic0g0,Starlyns,"Filing as single to get more tax return?

My accountant recommended to change my status from filling married jointly to both single in ADP.

The concept is you get taxed more during the year but the returns will be even higher than the charges.

For context we got like $1300 return for married filling joint in our last taxes.

f7f0d1,steamin661,"I come to you all for your sage advice as I continue my journey to plan, save, and invest my money.

**PERSONAL DETAILS**

My age: 33 â€“ Health and Safety Manager (13 years)

Wife Age: 27 â€“ Family Law Attorney (3 years)

Monthly Expenses: \~4k (bare minimum is closer to 3k).

I realize I have not saved as much as I should have, I didnâ€™t really start focusing saving until I was \~27yrs old - after my first marriage.

We also arenâ€™t as frugal as we could be.

Below I have outlined all of our financial info as well as my investment questions.

&amp;#x200B;

**INCOME**

My income: 100k

Wife Income: 75k

**Total Income**: 175k

&amp;#x200B;

**FUNDS**

Checking Account: 5k

Saving Account: 50k

**Total funds**: 55k

&amp;#x200B;

**RETIREMENT**

401K: 80k (Mine)

Simple IRA: 25k (Hers)

My Roth IRA (Just opened): 6k

Her Roth IRA (Just Opened): 6k

Previously we made over the income limit and could not open a Roth IRA.

**Total Retirement**: 117k

&amp;#x200B;

**DEBT**

**Debt**: Vehicles 20k (0% APR) â€“ No other debt

&amp;#x200B;

**HOUSING**

Renting Apartment: We currently rent for $1500 a month in Katy TX. I have owned homes in the past, however I move around for work on average every 3-5 years, and with the high property taxes, high market prices, and historical flooding in Houston, I have opted to not buy a house at this time. I am hoping to find something within in the next year or two (maybe an auction sale?).

&amp;#x200B;

**Investment Question**: I am not sure what to do next. I have very little education in investing or retirement savings in general. The 50k in our savings needs to be moved into a high yield saving account (I was thinking Ally Bank), however 50k is still overkill for an emergency fund and we are still ending up with a net couple thousand dollars each month. My father-in law is also paying back a loan we gave him of 20k, which will be coming in over the next 6 months.

&amp;#x200B;

Ultimately, this money needs to be invested into something else, and I really donâ€™t know what next steps to take.

&amp;#x200B;

EDIT: Formating",Yes,Yes,No,Yes,No
fha5ce,steamin661,"Last year my income was above the Roth IRA income limit and I failed to take advantage of a ""backdoor"" IRA. Is it possible to do this for 2019 still before April 15?

fhn18s,steamin661,"I am working on opening a traditional IRA in preparation for a conversion to a Roth IRA, though I ran across some confusing reading material on eligibility. I need help understanding.

I am wanting to contribute to a traditional IRA and convert to a roth IRA for 2019 (before april 15th deadline). As I was doing some educational reading, I came across a paragraph that has me scratching my head:

""While income limits are a non-issue for the backdoor, thereÂ exists one importantÂ prerequisite to be able to properly execute the backdoor Roth.

**You cannot have tax-deferred money in an IRA in your name**.

That includes traditional **IRA**, SEP **IRA**, and SIMPLE **IRA**, but ***does not*** include 401(k), 403(b) or similar accounts. If you do hold tax-deferred IRA dollars, youâ€™ll be subject to taxes when making your conversion per the [pro-rata rule](https://www.kitces.com/blog/the-impact-of-the-ira-aggregation-rule-on-after-tax-distributions-roth-conversions-60-day-rollovers-rmds-and-72t-payments/).""

I had a 401k last year and my wife had a Simple IRA last year (and this year).

Does this mean we will have to pay taxes when we do our conversion?

Someone I talked to mentioned that since I am putting in post tax money to a traditional IRA it would be a tax write off, however since I am making the conversion, it will simply negate the write off.",Yes,Yes,No,Yes,Yes
fhuh87,steamin661,"I've got about 50k to invest. I might use half that as a down payment on a house in 6 months, or throw it all in to the market. What are the best long term investments as we ride this wave?

I was thinking once we bottom out, slowly start trickling money into something like the Vanguard Total World Stock ETFÂ (VT). I am focused on long term investments. Outside of my 401k and Roth IRA I dont have anything else. This will be the first time I actually invest in a non-retirement account.

Edit: added more context.  

I have an additional 35k in emergency fund. My job isnt super solid, but my wife's is. We are able to live 100% off her income. 

We have set ourselves up well and feel confident to weather the storms ahead. We have maxed out retirement, etc. And now is the time to put this additional money (50k) somewhere. This seems like the time to start thinking about it. 

Where ever I put the money I expect to keep it a long time - either the house or the market. So I'm trying to figure out which is the best bet.",Yes,Yes,No,Yes,No
fjtdri,steamin661,"Wife and I want to buy a house. We are looking at the next 3-6 months. We have 35k for down payment and 35k in emergency. My job is rocky. Her's is solid and covers all the bills. Would you buy?

I have owned several houses over the years. Moved a lot for work. We currently live in an apartment paying $1600 per month.  

I've waited to own another house becasue prices have been high in Houston and wanted to locate good property which isnt prone to flooding. Prices are starting to drop a little here and we have settled in a nice area for her work. We are ready to buy a house in the next 3-6 months. We have the money for a down payment AND 10 months in emergency funding.  

My job and industry is not stable. I would even go as far to say, working in oil and gas, I could get let go within the next 6 months. I have a good job and am told not to worry, but you never know.  

My wife is a family law attorney and is solid. She has little to no worry in career.  

Our monthly expenses are about 3300, which her job covers.  

If we buy a 180k house with 20% down, our monthly payment will be about 1k (600 less per month). I am confident we can afford it with her income if worse ever happened.

Would you buy a house now in my circumstances? Or keep renting?",No,Yes,No,Yes,Yes
gij9df,steamin661,"Currently looking to buy a home, which would reduce monthly expenses by $500. Have enough for 10% down and 1 year of emergency funds. Her job is solid. Mine is very rocky. Thoughts?

We live on Houston. She is a lawyer and I'm in oil and gas. After moving around for the last 10 years, we are pretty much set living here because of her great job.  

Her Salary: 75k
My Salary:100k  

We are looking at a 200k house with 10% down. PMI would be about $40 per month until we reach 20% (this has been verified by lender due to credit, etc.). Overall its well below our means.

Our current rent is $1600 per month, which is the going rate for the area. If we purchased a home, we would be looking at ~1k with taxes and insurance. A saving of $500 per month.

Prices don't fluctuate here like in CA (+/- 300k). And the location we are looking at has no history of flooding and FEMA classifies as low risk.  

The only negative to this situation is my job is rocky. Our monthly expenses are around $3k. We have 40k set aside for emergency (not utilized for house).  

Her job covers all the bills, and I think $500 less in monthly expenses is a plus. I understand homes have additional cost (I've owned 3 before now - we used to move a lot but now settled). However not $500 per month extra. It will also help with taxes. We currently have nothing to write off.  

What do you guys think? Does it seem like a good move? We have been renting for 4 years now and at this point it feels like the money is being thrown away and not establishing equity.",Yes,Yes,No,Yes,Yes
kwpofn,steamin661,"I just received a call from physical therapy place i went to last Jan 2020. They claim I owe a balance of $550. I can't pay that amount. What's even worse, it really feels like fraud...

I attended two physical therapy sessions in Jan of 2020.  

1st session: $100 for 1hr. 

2nd session: $100 for 1hr.  

I had insurance at the time. So I understood that I would have to pay something and it would go towards my deductible.  

Today the PT settelments office (Oakbend PT in Richmond TX) called and said I owed $500. They said for two sessions, the cost was $1200. Insurance paid $700. I owe $500.  

I just got off the phone with the actual PT office and asked how much it would be if I did not have insurance or wanted to just not use insurance, they said $125. By that logic, the MOST I SHOULD PAY is an additional $50 (already paid $100 per session).  

How is this legal or possible!?!! They can just charge whatever they want and if the insurance says they won't pay they then come to me???  

I'm very nervous and upset. What can I do?  


Edit: this is not a debt collector, but rather the actual med facility calling. It has not went to collections yet.",No,Yes,No,No,Yes
kwr5tg,steamin661,"The fees on my new Nationwide 401(k) have me shook. Also, should I go traditional or ROTH? Ive added all my details in the description.

I am 34 male. Married. Wife is 28. We have no debt. Salary of 90k. Wife makes 70k. We rent an apartment in Texas (super high property taxes, which is why we rent and plan to move in \~5years). Our monthly expenses are around 3k. Savings are as follows:

&amp;#x200B;

**Previous employer 401k**: 90k

**ROTH IRA**: 14k

**Ameritrade balance**: 7k

**Wife ROTH IRA**: 13k

**SIMPLE IRA (Wife previous employer)**: 35K

**Ally Savings Account**: 65k (high savings as economy and COVID has us worried)

**Total**: 224k

&amp;#x200B;

Now that I have been at my current employer for a year, I can contribute into the 401k, however there are options Im unsure of and the the fees seem really high.

&amp;#x200B;

**Basic 401K details:**

* It is through Nationwide
* They offer Traditional and ROTH 401k
*  100% match for first 3%, 50% for next 2% (match is based on compensation, so I make 90k, so max match is \~$3600).
* They allow me to pick a single fund or I can build my own investments from a list
*  Nationwide 401(k) has really high fees. Examples:
   * AmFds 2050 TrgtDtRtrmt R6 - Annual Operating Expense of 1.26% - Per $1k it $12.60
   * Vngrd 500 Index Fd AS (VFIAX) - Annual Operating Expense of 0.91% - Per $1k it $9.10

&amp;#x200B;

Other important notes:

* I plan to max out my ROTH IRA and was also planning on maxing the new 401k, however the fees have me a little shook.
* I do plan on leaving this employer within the next couple years.

&amp;#x200B;

Questions:

* If I plan on moving employers in a few years, should I just not worry about the fees, as I can just roll the money over into another IRA or 401k? Therefore the fees will maybe drop significantly? **Example**: Invest 19.5k in 2021, in 2022 I leave employer and roll the money into my Roth IRA.

&amp;#x200B;

* Also, what is the thought process around ROTH or traditional 401k. It seems to be a fairly debated topic. Ramsey say 100% go IRA, however most other articles I read made the case for traditional, sighting that when people retire, their income will usually be lower and therefore they will actually pay less in taxes (assuming taxes don't substantially go up). Something else which might be important for this, is I live in Texas with no State income tax. And plan to move to either Washington or Oregon in the future. So I would be contributing in Texas and taking retirement outside of Texas.

&amp;#x200B;

* Last question, are there any obvious investment options I should invest into from the following list that they offer?
   * CohenStrs RealEst Sec Inst
   * Henesy Gas Util Indx Inv
   * AmFds Cap Wld Gr Inc R6
   * AmFds New Prspct R6 (RNPGX)
   * JnsHndrsn Entrp N (JDMNX)

mpp837,steamin661,"I'm pretty confused on why I am receiving the recovery rebate credit when completing my taxes on TurboTax, can someone explain?

t39b4q,steamin661,"I'm looking to hire a company or single person to help organize and schedule my mothers transportation while in a nursing home.

My mother lives in another state in assisted living.

She has 3 to 5 appointments per week. Each appointment needs a scheduled van ride to and from her assisted living. The process is pretty much call the van service, spend 15-20 entering info for one ride and move on to the next. I imagine it about 5hrs per month worth of work.

tpeihe,steamin661,"Moved from Houston to Denver and the first night had been horrible. I'm really struggling here and need some advice

When I moved into my apartment this afternoon, the movers commented on how loud my upstairs neighbors were. Continual loud banging and constant running across the floor / my ceiling. I didn't think much of it, as this is a Saturday at 1pm and sounds like they have rowdy kids. I mentioned this to the apartment manager in passing, just letting them know it was something I was keeping an eye on. 

As the night went on and I began unpacking I started running into other issues as well. The garbage disposal litterally burnt out and began smoking when I turned it on. The hot water heater seems to have a leak as it's continuously running and water is pouring out the piping into the drain. The front wood paneling on the kitchen sink is coming off. The toilets will not flush. There are a variety of other issues but those and the neighbors are the worst of it.

Here I am close to 1am in the morning. Things have only gotten worse. More running and more jumping from neighbors. 

I've been trying to sleep since 9pm as I have been tired from moving. I called security around 11:30pm and they mentioned they had a similar complaint from my next door neighbor! So it's obviously not just me. 

I can't do this. 

I lived in a wonderful quite apartment before here and I'm freaking out. I moved my life for a new job from Houston to Denver only to end up in what feels like a shitty situation. The apartment complex is Cortland Lone Tree.    

I called the leasing office 10min ago and left them a message about either moving into another unit or breaking my lease.

I just took a new job in Denver making 115k per year. My wife works remotely from home (our apartment) making 75k per year. With my bonus, I make 125k. Together we make 200k. We make a good living. And you would think there is no reason why we can't afford a home. However, I can't mentally wrap my head around the cost.   

We currently pay $2200 for our apartment in Lone Tree CO. We live comfortably right now. We both max out our 401k each year. We have ~250k in retirement. 40k in savings. Zero debt.

xwpytc,steamin661,"My insurance continues to deny my medical claims and im unsure what to do. Please help with advice.

I have been dealing with Chronic Pain for 5 years. Never had an issue with insurance not covering things. Six months ago I moved to Colorado and started a new job.   

I found a new Pain Management doctor so I could continue my medication. That was an ordeal, but fortunately got it taken care of. I have been going to this doctor monthly for last six months.   

Long story short, I have spent enough money on doc visits, medications, MRIs, and monthly medication that I should have already met me deductible and max out of pocket.   

The problem is, my insurance has denied every single claim from the Pain doctor. They have approved my MRIs, Meds, and regular doctor, just not this pain doctor.  They first said they didn't receive the needed medical record. I fought and fought and eventually got them to send. Months later they have reviewed and STILL denied due to coding issues and justification of services.    

I don't know what to do.   

I have asked my insurance for advice and they say there is nothing to do except ask them to send more paperwork.    

The doctor office continues to send and I keep being told it's not enough.    

The funny thing is, they approved my MRI this year and they pay for my medications each month,  but they won't approve the doctor costs? The same doctor who order the MRIs and writes my medication scripts.

There are around $2000 out of pocket costs that they have not approved. They show I have paid $2900, but in reality I have spent $4900. 2900 + 2000 (denied).    

My current doctor has recommended I see a surgeon and this year would actually be a good one cause on paper I have met my deductible and max out of pocket. But since they deny these claims, I am pretty much forced to keep paying out of pocket.    

I am very worried I would go to see the surgeon and they deny that too, then I screwed!    

What can I do?   

I have Anthem Insurance and the pain doctor is Mountain View Pain Center.    

Edit: Also, the initial reaction might be ""just go to another doctor or why have you waited so long?""   

Because it was only an issue for the first couple month, they I go involved and they sent the records. I was then told it can take 30-60 days to review. That's 4 months. So while the initial issues sucked, I was told it was taken care of and needed to wait 2 months. I've now been working on this again and I am running into a road block.    

And it's not so simple to stop going as I need my meds every month.   

Now I am looking for another doctor, but I'm still in the same boat of  having $2k denied. I shouldn't be paying another penny, but I have to until they approve.    

So I'm screwed either way.",No,Yes,No,Yes,Yes
155qkyy,Steel_Reign,"I can't seem to escape the random monthly expenses

About 4 years ago, I finished my degree and initially started making double what I was at the time. Then 2 years later, I moved into a new position and nearly doubled that breaking into the 6 figure salary range, which is more than I ever thought I was going to make at any point in my life (hadn't made more than 30k/yr at that point and where I grew up 50k/yr was a perfectly fine place to stop.).

So of course I had some lifestyle creep, but nothing excessive. My wife and I had kids, needed an actual house and a second car but absolutely nothing out of our means. I have a 401k that I max out to ensure I get at least some savings. After bills and everything there should be about $1500 left over each month, but this always disappears.

Last month it was $1000 in medical bills, before that it was $700 in HOA dues + $300 for some small unexpected house repairs. This month it was $1000 in minor repairs for our older vehicle. Next month my dog is due for a vet visit with shots and flea medication, which will probably be close to $500. It seems like this has been the case almost every single month since I started my new job.

Do these types of expenses ever slow down? I just can't seem to put away for an emergency fund when they're eating up what is supposed to be my leftover money every month. Despite making what I thought was a ton of money, I'm still living paycheck to paycheck and not even doing anything fun with it.",No,Yes,No,Yes,Yes
16ju1a8,Steel_Reign,"Getting Laid Off Next Month in HCOL Area; How to prepare?

I was notified this week that my job is going to be eliminated in 30 days. I'll be receiving a 2-month severance package, but unfortunately after that I don't have much left in saving due to multiple family emergencies this year. So with what I have, the next month of pay and the severance, I can maybe squeak by for 4 months of bills.

My current monthly expenses are around 6k, and I've already cancelled pretty much everything that isn't essential. The last 2 big 'optional' things are pre-k for my kids (1300/mo) and our second car (500/mo). Taking the kids out of school would either make it harder for me to find a job or would mean my wife would have to quit hers. My wife makes about 2000/mo after expenses.

While I don't have much in savings, I do have a decent amount in retirement. About 5k in 529 plans for my kids, 30k in IRA (pre-tax), and 70k in 401k.

This is the first time I've ever been fired before and also the first time I've been without a significant amount of savings. So some of my questions are:

* Can I still draw unemployment with a severance package and what's the cap on unemployment (was making roughly 150k/yr)?
* I assume the 529 is the easiest/smartest to draw from if necessary, but what about the others? Additionally, I'll have to roll the 401k into something else; any suggestions (my IRA came from a previous 401k).
* I've heard the job market is rough right now, what's the general turnaround for finding a new job at this level? I'm a senior manager in tech.

I recently got laid off but was able to land a 40-hour/week contract job almost immediately. Unfortunately, it pays about 60% what I'm used to making and doesn't come with any benefits, so it's mostly a stop-gap until I can find something full-time closer to my desired salary.

Is my capital gains the difference between 440k-400k (40k gain) or 413k-400k (13k gain) or 413k-415k (2k loss). What I've read online led me to believe it's the 2nd (13k gain).

I'm in the process of buying a new home, and I've already been pre-qualified and have put 5% down, which was required to start construction.

However, I'm open to shopping around and possibly changing loan types depending on interest rates and closing costs. At the moment, I'm leaning towards a VA loan because it doesn't have PMI, but it does have a lending fee of 1.65%. Do other loan types also have this type of fee?

The estimated value of my new home is already $50,000 more than what I locked into and I have an 800+ credit score with 0 debt (outside of my current mortgage) if that helps anything. I may have enough to go up to 10% down after this house sells.",Yes,Yes,No,Yes,No

I'm not actively contributing to the IRA. It's an old company stock roll over that's been doing very well (4x in 10 years). I contribute 6% + 3% match into the 401k.

If I want to retire early, i don't think adding more to any of these is a good idea because I cant withdraw until my 60s.

of6fbx,Steel_Reign,"Vacation home as an investment?

I recently got a promotion at work and was looking into ways to expand my investment portfolio outside of my IRA and 401k, but I came into an interesting proposition. 

My family owns a large amount of property on lake in the Midwest and has decided to start piecing it out into lots and selling it. I was offered what seems like relatively cheap, interest free lakefront property (would cost less than $150k for 2 acres and having a modular home put in).

Where I currently live is excruciatingly hot in the summer and no one ever wants to go outside. The wife is always on about taking multi-week family vacations in the summer to somewhere cooler, so this seemed like a potentially dual option of an investment and a vacation home.

Based on my estimate, it would cost about 10k/yr to have it paid off in roughly 15 years. I figure this is about twice as much as normal 2-week family vacation would cost, but since I work remote we could spend the entire summer there and potentially rent it out during the non-winter parts of the year.

However, in most metro areas, a 2 bedroom apartment is that much, and if you need a 3 bedroom that's 3-4k/month when you can get a house for much less. It really seems like it's better to stretch passed that 30% if rent would eat up even more than that.

qbitci,Steel_Reign,"Picking Health Insurance Plans (US)?

My company has decided to streamline our health insurance policy next year and is removing/replacing a lot of options, and it's very difficult for me to decide what is the best decision. My current plan felt like a fine balance of medium monthly premiums + medium deductible + low co-pays.

Here is a summary of my new options:

* 5 Plans. Only the highest has co-pays. Lowest 2 tiers are irrelevant for me.
* Yearly premium difference between Plan A and B is $3000. Plan C is $3000 lower than Plan B.
* Deductible for Plan B is 3x that of Plan A, however, both have the same Out of Pocket Max.
* Deductible for Plan C is 1.5x higher than Plan B and Out of Pocket max is 1.25x higher.
* Only Plan A has co-pays ($25 office / $50 specialist / $150 ER). All other plans are 100% out of pocket until deductible is met (except preventative care).
* All plans include 100% preventative care visits as outlined by the US government.
* Monthly premiums are taken out pre-tax.

At face value, it seems like I should choose Plan B or C unless I expect to pay more than $3000 (or $6000) in specialist/non-standard office visits per year. An ER visit was be more financially damaging with Plan B but over the course of the year saving on the monthly premiums this would still almost even out. With out of pocket max being nearly the same, a life-threatening illness won't completely screw me either.

However, I wonder if there's more to this, such as wanting the higher premiums so I pay less in taxes each year? I feel like I'm missing something and this has been made more complicated than it should.

Previously, if you sold a used coach for $1000 but initially paid $2000 for it, you wouldn't pay taxes on the $1000 because it was technically a loss. If you sold the same couch for $2500, you would pay capital gains on the $500 because that's the profit.

I've considered selling before it's time to renew the registration next year and using that to buy another used reliable car (under $7k). The Rav4 is worth around $3k.

Buy a reliable used car for around $10,000-15,000 and paying maybe $4k down PLUS whatever I get for the Rav4. So I'd be getting a car loan of about $12-14k.

Long story short, just ended a 5 year relationship (had a ring/ready to propose which she wanted until recently) and we had plans to buy a starter home in Orange County ~$750K ($100K/down each) 3bd/2bth. We were looking for the past 8 months but our timing with COVID, low inventory, and low interest rates really made it difficult as we watched ourselves get priced out of some of the better areas.

I'm now in a situation where I'm 36 and feel like I should buy a place to restart my life, but with $100K down I'm basically looking at 2bd/2bth condos.

Annual income is $110K/gross + ~10% Bonus + $10K Equity

* $100k Savings (for down payment)

* $230k Investments (would only liquidate for emergencies, capital gains taxes/etc.)

* $114K Roth IRA

* $237K 401K

* Net take home excl. bonus/equity is ~$5.2K after HSA/401K contributions against ~$2.1K in monthly expenses ($1100/rent and ~$1K food/entertainment/misc) = ~$3K monthly buffer currently

* I rent a room in a nice $1M+ home with 2 other older gentlemen (55+), but now in my 30s and entering the dating pool again feel like it's a bit weird. Main reason I was here was because ex was getting her masters and living at home rent free, and we decided to save as much money as possible for a house when she graduated.

I'm looking at condos with an all in monthly payment (mortgage + HOA + Insurance + Taxes) of ~$2.5K in more desirable areas where it would be easy to rent a 2nd room (Irvine, Costa Mesa, Tustin).

The main reason I'm hesitant on buying is because of how insane the market is over the past year with COVID/Low interest rates... not sure if it's smart to buy a 2bd $500K condo at this point plus the additional $300-$400 HOA.
Plus side is low interest rates, but I expect home prices to drop if interest rates go up as well..

Alternative option is finding a roomate more around my age to rent a 2bd apartment for now (~$2.2K apt), but I feel like if I'm going to have a roomate anyways buying a condo and renting out a room makes more sense? I plan on living there at least 5 years.

lil9r6,Strife025,"Best way to handle non-retirement funds that are in a managed portfolio that you no longer want?

I'm currently 36 and have been saving since I graduated college.

For the first 10 or so years I let my uncle manage my savings whose a Financial Advisor through Capital Group/American Funds. Now there's nothing shady or anything and I've had good returns since I started saving in 2007, it's just that the managed funds have a .5-1% expense ratio and I haven't seen a return that justified that high of an expense.

Around 2016 I decided to stop putting money in my American Funds account other than the annual Roth IRA limit and started my own portfolio with Fidelity where my 401K was located. I generally just put money in a few ETFs (like SPY) and maybe throw a couple grand in some companies I like, but overall I'm a long-term/lower risk investor. I've seen that low cost ETFs seem to have similar/sometimes better performance than the managed mutual funds and I am kind of over manage funds in general now.

I currently have ~$267K in non-retirement and ~$134K in Roth IRA through American Funds. I know it's pretty simple to transfer my Roth IRA to Fidelity since it's a retirement account and I won't be penalized. My main question is in regards to non-retirement... I'm pretty sure I'm forced to leave it there because I'm going to get hit with capital gains tax and don't plan on liquidating it to use anytime soon (i.e. probably not until I retire in 30 years...)

Was just wondering what people's thoughts are on that (and maybe American Funds in general?), ideally I would love to just centralize everything but not at the cost of paying a bunch of taxes which probably won't be offset in returns anytime soon.

lqp7s3,Strife025,"Does anyone have suggestions on updating Cost Basis for in-kind transfer of mutual funds?

I just finished doing an in-kind transfer to consolidate my portfolio from American Funds to my Fidelity account. When I was younger my uncle was managing my investments in American Funds which has a really high ER (hence why I consolidated now that I'm in my 30s and am more actively managing my own money with index funds).

The transfer for non-retirement funds is held in 12 American Funds mutual funds totaling ~$260K, it had regular investments from 2007-2016 as well as dividend reinvestments, so not a simple cost basis.

Fidelity is giving me the option to manually update my cost basis for these mutual funds I just transferred and from what I've read online you can update only once using one of 4 different methodologies. Was wondering if anyone has advice on the best approach for this. What happens if I were to sell these funds to re-balance my portfolio without updating the cost basis?

Eventually I want to re-balance into a more simple index funds approach similar to my Roth IRA/401K, but trying to figure out the capital gains I might pay if I actually sold the ~$260K (my principle investment was about half of this, but because of dividend re-investments and paying taxes on that over the years I'm assuming it's not super simple). 

My thought process was to liquidate whenever another dip happens, since I'll lower my capital gains tax and I'll be instantly balancing into index funds which have also dipped. I've already paid up-front sales fees on some of the mutual funds, so don't think I need to rush re-balance immediately even if the ER is like .5% vs .1% for an index?",Yes,Yes,No,Yes,No
lr77nv,Strife025,"Looking for general advice on investment allocations across taxable account, 401K, &amp; Roth IRA.

I'm 36 and in the process of taking a step back and completely rebalancing all of my investments after years of just throwing money into funds without a real strategy. I didn't take advantage of tax advantaged accounts as much as I would have liked (for example only contributed 6% into 401K for the 50% company match and instead invested the rest into taxable investment account instead of maxing out 401K contribution limits).

I've read a lot the past week on asset allocations and investment across your entire portfolio and was hoping some people with more experience have some advice. I'm currently planning on investing in the 3 fund approach 65/20/15 asset mix. I was planning on using ETFs in taxable account (VTI/VXUS/BND), Mutual Fund index's in my Roth IRA (FSKAX, FTIHX, FXNAX), and my 401K is limited in options so I only have Vanguard targeted 2050 or 10 individual fund options with State Street S&amp;P 500 Index, VTSNX, and State Street U.S. Bond Index being most relevant for this allocation.

These are my current assets:

* $352K in individual taxable account with Fidelity

* $237K in 401K with Fidelity

* $132K in Roth IRA with Fidelity

* $101K in High Yield (lol) savings account as I'm in the process of looking for a ~$500K condo and will be putting 20% down

* $5K HSA (ignoring it for this purpose and have 65/20/15 self contained re-balance option since this isn't a true investment account)

As you can see, I haven't really maximized by tax deferred accounts (i.e. 401K) which is making it somewhat challenging to rebalance things. I'm planning on taking the 15% LTCG tax on my individual account to exit long term positions on high ER mutual funds and some individual stocks to rebalance. I anticipate saving less in taxable accounts in the future as I have since increased my pre-tax 401K and HSA withholdings and when I buy a condo my monthly cost of living will increase ~$1K/mo. I currently save about $30K of my net income per year which will probably go down to ~$10K after the above adjustments and increased expenses.

So the root of my question is based on reading the bogleheads wiki and balancing assets across all your account types; i.e. stock index funds are best in taxable accounts (Individual) -&gt; tax-free accounts (Roth IRA), and bonds are best in tax-deferred (401K). I'm thinking these are my options and not sure what is best:

1. Holding VTI in my individual account which is ~49% of my overall investment assets (excluding savings/HSA) and then balance the rest with my 401K/Roth IRA to get a 65/20/15 mix with emphasis of bonds in 401K as second priority. Knowing that I don't really want to rebalance my taxable account moving forward due to capital gains tax it seems like holding the biggest mix in there makes the most sense and balancing around it? I don't anticipate liquidating much/if any of my taxable account barring some unexpected emergency. I'll slowly fund up my savings account back to ~6-12 months of living expenses after I use it for a down payment.

2. Since I have limited options with my 401K not sure if it makes sense to just to buy into the 2050 target fund and completely remove it from the mix and manually balance the rest around my Roth IRA/individual account?

3. Completely isolate all 3 accounts and balance each individually. Turn off DRIP in taxable account and use future savings to continue to balance asset mix so I don't have to sell positions to rebalance. This probably seems like a less ideal option?

4. Something Else??

mdcria,Strife025,"Advice on down payment currently sitting in savings accnt earning practically nothing

Back in March 2020 when the markets were dropping like crazy I pulled $70K out of my taxable portfolio as a hedge against further declines (dumb but was ~10% of my total personal + retirement accounts so not the end of the world). The thought process was to save this for a down payment on a condo that I wanted to buy anyways in the next year. 

Fast forward to now, I've put offers on 3 places but a combination of high demand and low inventory has made the market insane and I've lost all 3 places even though I've offered $30-$40K over listing. 

I've been kind of dejected on buying a place for now (first time home buyer in my 30s), my friend/family suggested just waiting until vaccine roll out and hopefully inventory becoming more normal. Even if prices stay the same at least there will be more options since everyone says it can't stay like this forever. Right now not only are things expensive but there's also very few good options.

So this brings me to the root of my question, I currently have $90K ($20K for emergency fund that will remain) sitting in a HYSA earning .4% interest which I feel like is a huge waste. I'm debating putting $70K back in my Fidelity account since I'm probably not going to even attempt to purchase a place again for 6 months.

The second part to this is that I have some positions (few large cap single stocks and some high ER mutual funds) in my taxable account I want to exit and move to market index funds (i.e. VTIAX). I've recently decided to simplify my investing into a 3-5 fund approach (total market + bonds + couple sector focused index funds). My thought process is that I can put this $70K into VTIAX and when the time comes that I decide I want to purchase a place again I can exit my other positions that I want to do anyways (so LTCG and not STCG on this $70K).

I'm aware that the market can always shift/correct and there's a risk to losing money in the short term, my thought process is mainly that because I'm not actually pressured to move from my current situation I could just ride it out if that happens (I have a good living situation in a place I've lived at for 5 years and only pay $1050/mo in rent in a HCOL area in SoCal).

Is this a dumb decision, should I just leave my money in cash that is probably earning less than inflation if I have even some desire to still purchase a condo in the next year?",Yes,Yes,No,Yes,Yes

Alright so this is a bit of a complicated question and there's probably not one good answer, but figured I'd see if anyone has good insight.

I put together a spreadsheet of my current annual income and estimated expenses with precise tax calculations based on Fed/State tax tables for 2021: [Imgur Income](https://i.imgur.com/AznsIi3.png)

I'm currently saving a large portion of my income mainly because I live well below my means and don't feel the need to spend money.

The Summary is:

* 138K gross

* 47K-40K taxes depending on 401k contribution options

* ~28K expenses

* 65K-71K Assets (depending on taxes)

In the next couple of years I expect to buy a Condo and my expense obligations would go up ~18K (mid scenario) still allowing me to save ~50K/yr.

I'm 36, single (ended a 5yr in Feb), and have really been analyzing my portfolio this year (less about individual fund allocations and more overall strategy between accounts for tax purposes). In the past, I've just been doing 401K traditional, Roth IRA, and rest into individual taxable/HYSA. I'm at the point where I have too much money in non-retirement because I haven't been utilizing all my retirement account options (I didn't max my 401K or HSA in the past). 

I'm also trying to figure out how best to balance with Traditional 401K if I start doing mega-backdoor Roth. My 401K plan with Fidelity allows for after tax contributions which I started this paycheck, I also called them and they confirmed that I can do in-service withdrawals on after tax dollars and theoretically I have the ability to do mega-backdoor although the rep wouldn't advise me on the process.

**Current Assets:**

* $6K HSA

* $100K HYSA (emergency fund/down payment)

* $137K Roth IRA

* $244K Traditional 401K

* $359K taxable non-retirement

**Questions:**

1. My plan is $75K/yr in net retirement income with a retirement goal of 60-65 mainly because I don't mind working right now (so could very well have more than I need). Assuming this is 401K/pre-tax dollars that would be ~$100K gross. Because this is lower than my current gross income of ~$138K I'm trying to figure out if it makes sense to continue traditional 401K or switch to Roth 401K (or some hybrid)

2. In relation to the above, I'm really trying to minimize contributions to non-taxable at this point and ""catch-up"" for retirement accounts. This is why I started to research into mega-backdoor Roth this year. My plan is to contribute ~20K post-tax dollars automatically from my paycheck into 401k and do an annual backdoor (so will still probably have some non-retirement contributions but way lower than the past). Knowing this, does it make sense to contribute $19.5K to traditional to lower my taxes ~$6K/yr if I'm putting $26K into Roth as well (vs $46K into Roth and none into Traditional and eating taxes now).

I posted about maybe finding a fee based financial/retirement planner yesterday for questions like this but people suggested just posting here instead first.. so wondering if anyone has good advice :x

**Background:**

* 36 years old

* Live in Orange County, CA

* $880K NW, no debt: $10K emergency funds, $90K HYSA (downpayment), $360K Taxable Brokerage, $260K 401K, $150K Roth IRA, $8K HSA (3 Fund 65/20/15 overall portfolio not including HYSA &amp; emergency fund)

* Base Salary $126K + Profit Share = ~$140K-$145K total comp

Long story short, I basically put off purchasing a condo the past 3 years to buy a home with my ex after she finished her masters program and got a job. We recently broke up in Feb. after 5 years together and I no longer have the dual-income or need for a SFD in SoCal (like $800K+) so I'm trying to decide what to do. As everyone knows, this has come at a terrible time because the housing market is crazy.

A 1 story condo (no one above/below) with only 1 shared wall and 2 car garage is going up for sale in a neighborhood I like for $550K 1144 sq ft (this was my original price limit I set for myself)... but I fully expect it to sell for $575K-$600K based on my experience in this market and recent comps (have lost 2 offers previously). This is basically the closest I can get to an actual detached home at this price level for a condo...

On one hand I really want to own a place eventually, on the other hand I have a pretty good living situation currently and save a ton of money in a HCOL area. I've lived in a really nice 4bd/3bth 3K sq ft house with two other guys for the past 5 years, 1 mile from my job, in a nice neighborhood... I only pay $1050/mo. We have a $4,200/mo lease which has stayed the same for 5 years and one roommate has the master + office room so pays half.

**Thoughts:**

* To put an offer down I would need to sell more of my taxable investments (20% down or really no chance in this market), plus extra for closing costs, furniture, etc.

* Mortgage + Taxes + HOA + insurance would put me at a ~$2.8K monthly payment which is about the limit I'm comfortable with for my salary. My plan was to rent out a room but don't want to base my ability to make payments on that.

* I'm currently maxing my 401K, Roth IRA, HSA, + an extra ~$2K/mo, I wouldn't be saving the extra $2K anymore and may not be able to max out the 401K without a roommate if I purchased a place (accounting for maintenance, unexpected stuff, etc.)

* Buy vs rent calculators say renting is better if an equivalent place is less than ~$2K/mo (7 years staying put). It's kind of hard to compare because I have 2 roommates but also live in a nice house ($1K/mo) vs living in a smaller place (but my own) for $2.8K with the potential to rent out a room for $1K (net $1.8K). This puts both scenarios roughly the same financially if I rent out a room, so I'm basically trading more responsibility and dealing with a renter vs worry free living situation and not having to deal with any extra work.

Part of me thinks I should not buy a place for now and just keep saving aggressively until I actually need a place, the other part thinks that as I'm getting older I really should think about buying a place...

I'll preface this by saying it's not strictly financial, and I'm someone who is very frugal despite my income, think it's a combination of a few factors but thought this is maybe the best place to post this.

**Background:**

* 36 years old, driving the same 2001 civic since I was 16; bought new myself after working my ass off for 2 summers to put a down payment, cosigned by parents, continued to pay off thru college 

* $140-$150K/gross income, save ~$50K maxing out retirement accounts (401K, Roth IRA, HSA) + extra into taxable brokerage using 3-fund portfolio strategy

* Car also only has 134K miles on it as I don't drive much anymore, only drive ~5K miles/yr at this point. Live in SoCal suburbs though so still need a car with no public transportation and things a bit spread out.

Recently due to it's age some cosmetic stuff has been ""falling apart""; headliner is starting to separate in a couple spots, driver side tint starting to peel off, black rubber around window starting to dry out and peel off... nothing major but still kind of annoying. Also I have some work coming up in the near future for ~$1K (2nd new timing belt/water pump since 2009 was last time I replaced them, slight oil leak which needs new oil pump). 

Overall I think for the age it's in pretty good shape though, and yes I'm aware I'm 36 and driving a ""riced"" out civic still although it's not loud at least :):
[Car Pic from Today](https://i.imgur.com/TRCwWzw.jpg)

With that all said, some F&amp;F telling me my car is still fine, just continue driving it. If you asked me this is what I would say as well... also hesitant to buy right now because of inflated market.

Other camp says I should drive something more age appropriate since I'm getting older and have disposable income, also added caveat that I recently got out of a 5 yr relationship and will need to date again soon... 

If I do buy something it will still be pretty conservative, maybe another civic or mazda 3 or a step up for a camry/accord. I really want a Lexus IS but can't justify the price for how little I drive...

Wondering what people think... Thanks.",,,,,
10rrbjl,Successful_Leg_707,"Do most family member trustees serve gratis or for pay?

Family member trustee in this situation is taking 1.5% of the trust assets per annum for all the individual trusts created under the agreement.  On top of that, charges investment advisory fees and hires an attorney for advice about how to administer a trust.  These administration fees are overkill for adult children as beneficiaries, who each have an individual trust. At this point, any professional trustee would be more knowledgeable and cheaper.  This has been a bone of contention among family members where everyone ends up angry.  Is this a pretty common scenario?",,,,,

j1em18,Successful_Leg_707,"Money missing from ILIT (irrevocable life insurance trust)?

I am the beneficiary of an ILIT that came into existence several years ago.  In case anyone doesn't know, an ILIT owns the life insurance policy of an insured.  The death benefit is shielded from estate taxes and generation skipping taxes.  It is a strategy to keep the income out of a decendent's estate; otherwise, if the amount was included in the estate and it was above a certain IRS threshold, estate taxes would be paid.

The tax-free death benefit was $1.8 million.  According to the trust document, the benefit was to be split into 1/3 shares, per stripes.  I would have expected that since no taxes would have been taken out, the trust would be initially funded with $600,000; however, that was not the case, it was more like $500,000.  Is there any reason why there would be a shortfall?  Are there typically expenses that deducted from the life insurance benefit?",,,,,

jjvhv7,Successful_Leg_707,"Is there a case for investing in actively managed mutual funds?

All the evidence I have seen is that, for most people (not talking about institutions here), it makes sense to follow a low-cost, passive index based investing strategy.  That would mean invest in broad market equity and fixed income funds that follow an index and not try to do better than the market.  If someone where to try and do better, that would require time and research to find opportunities to profit -- you pay an actively managed fund through a higher expense ratio, and hopefully you get alpha that exceeds the expenses you are paying.  However, if they did better, could they sustain it? or would it just be all due to luck?  

I'm trying to understand the opposition (and I know this sub advocates index based investing, which I agree) -- is there anyone out there who thinks there is a place for active management?

Grandfather left trusts for three grandkids as beneficiaries.  He named his only living daughter a Kira as trustee.  Kira is not married, doesnâ€™t have kids or friends and is a spiteful person.

Trust also states that â€œKira cannot be removed for any reasonâ€.

Kira doesnâ€™t want the beneficiaries to have any money. Most requests are denied or have strings attached like they have to pay out of pocket for reimbursement which make it difficult to get anything.  Only things like medical or dental are for reimbursement, any other requests get flat out denied.  And still they need to be paid by the beneficiary first.

u7zbtm,Such_Occasion_5760,"Health Insurance Options after losing Job Because of diagnosis of illness(terminal, chronic, critical)

Hello,

&amp;#x200B;

I do have a term insurance cover with living benefits which will offer me 25% of the coverage if one of the illnesses terminal, chronic, critical ever occurs.

But I'm wondering if I'm working through a W2 and get health care insurance through W2, and if I lose the job, say after 3 months of leave of absence, and they fire me, what happens to my insurance to cover expenses?

I know, then the COBRA kicks in, but that is a short period of time.

I'm a software engineer with a desk job. 29 yo, M, 180k/annum, married with 1 kid, stay-at-home wife

This is what I received from the Northwest mutual agent on the policy:

Q-1: Is it OWN or ANY occupation coverage? Could they deny the claim saying that I can work on anything else if I can't work on my own occupation anymore due to some reason?

\- The policy weâ€™re applying for is â€œmodified own occupation.â€ Our home officeâ€™s definition of that is â€œThe insured is totally disabled when both unable to perform the substantial and material duties of the regular occupation and not gainfully employed in any occupation.â€

Q-2: Does this policy have an alcohol/mental disability limitation?

Alcohol/drugs would not qualify for a claim. Mental disorders would qualify for a claim depending on how it affects your work functions (and assuming there are no exclusion riders for it during underwriting).

The policy designed for you has a benefit that lasts until Age 67.  


My employer offers 60% of base pay(125k) free of cost. And the benefit will be taxed. They will pay me 3900/month if I were to get disabled. The monthly premium is 38$, which goes up so is the payout amount. They used my current gross income(w2+other = 180K) and my current employer's disability policy payout to come up with 3900$ to make sure I get 100% of the paychecks when I'm disabled starting the 91st day of the policy effective until I'm 67. The benefit increases with inflation or pay rises and also the premium amount per month paid.

Is there anything I should know about before applying for this policy? Can anyone help me understand if this is good?",,,,,

t6l4oa,SuddenlySilva,"investment/growth strategy for dependent social security $16-20K/year - i'm 62 wife is 52

DO I have this right?  Following is my sketch of a plan for kids socsec.   


We are both retiring this year with pensions and my Social Security. We have two boys (11 &amp; 13)   
They will get about $16-$20K in dependant socsec benefits.   The money comes in their  names so it's effectively tax free. 

We have the next 7 years to make the most of this resource for them. 

My wife will work part time so there's the earned income.  I opened a Roth just for this so that starts the five year clock for withdrawal.   I could open a second Roth for my wife but we will not be able to withdraw until she's 59 1/2 except for education expenses,   so that might work. 

I could open 529 but i don't want to tie up too much  specifically for education.  Our retirement is all about the boys for the first 10 years.  We got a late start and we have to make up as much as we can.

That means their education expenses might include relocating to the city they go to school (probably within the state)  Or even moving overseas.   


So, out of $20K/yr I  can put $7000 in my Roth and start pulling it out tax free in five years for whatever i want.  I can put another $7000 in wifes Roth but withdrawal in five years is limited to legit education expense,   Do i have this right?   


There may be a few more dollars.  I have not  found a clear answer from ssa.gov.  It could be as much as $24,000 until the first kid turns 18.

z02vku,SuddenlySilva,"Stash money in IRA to avoid 2022 tax on 401K distribution ?

I just retired, spouse is still working for a while.  I had a loan balance on my 401K which upon retirement became a taxable distribution for 2022.  


Am i correct in my understanding, i can load a like amount into an IRA before April 15 and effectively erase that tax hit?   


I know, it's a bit convoluted.  The retirement is pretty well setup with a federal pension and being a kept man but we could not move the cash to the loan in time so it becomes taxable income for 22.

so ""wife"" and I just started refi'ing the house

former interest rate was 4.375. and we have done  around 6 years of payments on it ( so around 24years left). house value is around 220k and we are 172k remaining in our current mortgage loan. Current payments including insurance is  1669.

Current lender came back with a new 30 years term at 2.875%. Monthly payments would be around 1200. If we keep the same payments it will lower the time from 24 years remaing to around 16 years cutting of around 8 years of payments new

Chase (our main bank) came back with 2.99 but monthly payments around the same 1200ish

so im thinking current lender is just adding a bigger refi cost into the loan which is what is making up for the lower interest rate..

Now I want to place the 20k somewhere but they need to be pretty liquid and stable so im not putting them into investments. but looking into HYSA but thatis a doozy as well with the current low interest rate.

is there a better stable/semi liquid placement i only need around maybe 1 withdrawel a quater if even that.

I'm also thinking about finding maaby a HYSA that has a good SUB to make up for the lower interest and then move it around quaterly/yearly to get new SUB's. any recommendations for good subs is welcome

70.000 - 19.500 401k = 61.500

61.500 - 3.500  HSA =  58.000

58.000 with the standards 11.000 deductible is still going to place me in 48.000 taxable income with is still in the 24% bracket.

If i am getting this right that means my next 6k to an IRA  if it was an Roth i pay 24% tax off however if i go traditional i am not paying taxes until at pay out which most likely will be lower as my income will be lower at the time.

So Why is Roth recommend so much. Just for liquidity or am i missing a point here ?

plnf3k,Sven_Bent,"The hidden cost of 15year-mortgage

You will often hear people recommending a 15year mortgage over a 30yar because it cheaper. But that perspective often ignores opportunity cost and the fact you are utilization more resources to make it cheaper.

The alternative is to use a longer mortgage and use the same resources to grow faster than the debt and you will most often outperform financially on the 30year mortgage.

The results in most cases a 30year mortgage you can pay back faster and cheaper than a 15year mortgage

This is called opportunity cost. You lost out an opportunity on the extra monthly payments you are using on the 15year loan.

The premise is simply. You use the same amount of money every month as you would with your 15year mortgage but instead of it all going to the mortgage. with the 30y mortgage you use the different in monthly payments to invest.

Aka instead of $1200 going to mortgage on a 15 year mortgage, you do $800 to mortgage and $400 to retirement/investments.

This also have the benefits that in slim years you would be draining your EF slower as you are only responsible for a smaller monthly payment

I will be using two simply calculator for these examples

[https://www.amortizationtable.org/](https://www.amortizationtable.org/)

[https://www.calculator.net/investment-calculator.html](https://www.calculator.net/investment-calculator.html)

Then I am using mortgage examples from banks that poped up searching for ""mortgage offers"" I will roll the points into the loan amount. This will handicap the longer mortgages

I will use investment growth with a 10% nominal growth which is appears to be the average looking over 10, 30 and even 50 years of the total stock market (aka for people using broad ""safe"" index investment strategies)

This is usually where people would say â€œSee the 30y mortgage is 50k more expensiveâ€ â€¦And yes it is, but it over 30years now let looks into what we can make in those 30 years.

The monthly difference is 1,334.68 - 822.51 = 512.17 you can invest monthly all 30 years in the 30year mortgage

&amp;#x200B;

In both cases we used the monthly payments of 1,334.68 over 30 years so the ""cost"" is the same in both situations for that we got 1 house and either 531,795.20 in our investments or 1,056,526.46 in our investments

Choosing the 15year mortgage highly reduce our financial situation

In the end we lost in the 15 year mortgage

1,056,526.46 - 531,795.20= 524,731.26

The 15year mortgage cost you half a million dollars in hidden opportunity cost. Or over twice the starting loan amount.

&amp;#x200B;

BUT I WANT TO THE FREEDOM OF NO MORTGAGE, some people might say.

OK, that is a perfect valid value to have. Itâ€™s going to cost you a little but in your future financial situation but even here 30year mortgage goes better. Letâ€™s look

Investment Balance 204,071.05

Mortgage Balance 138,188.23

Total after paying off the house = 65882.82

&amp;#x200B;

After 15 years and finish paying the house, you will with a 30yar mortgage + investment end up with 65 thousand dollars more in your hand.

That is a pretty good start for the rest of your investment life

What does it do for 15 years of investing the mortgage payments?

&amp;#x200B;

Again, it easy to see the 30year mortgage comes out way ahead even if you goal is to pay of the house in 15 years

After 15 additional years of investing, you are behind 807,004.09 - 531,795.20 = 275208.89 in your financial. or the entire worth of your house.

Half a million less

Bottom line is you need to consider the entire impact on your finances when doing a mortgage and not just the impact on the cost of the house.

if not, you might just cheat yourself from a lot of money

Investment are not a sure thing which is why averages was calculated. you might value a stable growth more than and unstable growth. My thumb of rules is  that stable growth is twice as good as unstable averages. so any  with and interest rate above  half the average in investments  could  be prioritized above investments

&amp;#x200B;

**TLDR: 15year loans with today low interest rates will in average hinder your finical growth tremendously and/or increase the time to pay of the mortgage**

&amp;#x200B;

Full disclosure: I did not take in gains taxes I was assuming 401k/IRA or something similar as investments vehicle.  Any gains taxes will limit the differences.

&amp;#x200B;

**ON RISK**

it seems that alot of people are not understanding what averages are doing and claiming stock market risk was not calculated in the picture. 

It was. that is how averaging something does. it take bot the high and low and gives you an number of what it all sort outs to. it was clearly indicated tha the average used for the stock market was taken from look at the performance over  50, 30 and 10 years on the stock-markets. THIS INCLUDES THE RISK ON THE BAD YEARS

&amp;#x200B;

Now on loosing your jobs. let me reiterate.

if you have lost you income the worst thing you can do is have a high expense. with a 15y mortgage you have a higher expense so you are saddle tighter.  Your drain your EF faster you are running a higher risk of defaulting and being hit bit all the bad stuff that comes with that

on a 30y mortgage you can stop putting in funds in your investments decreasing your monthly expense directly, straddling you less  tight, Reducing the strain on your EF.

**30y mortgage makes it EASIER to ride out a bad time.**

and that is not calculating the fact that you have a big chunk of liquidity in your investments for easy access that is not only EASIER to acceas than the equity in your home. but also BIGGER.

Everyone keeps telling me that ""renting is throwing away money""

I'm pretty sure I'm staying in the area I am in, a MCOL area. My rent is $1200 a month (likely to increase to $1350ish in July)

I am 24

I am interested in retiring early, (aiming for late 30s, 40s if I have to).

I made $134,000 last year, though my base pay is somewhere around $65,000 per year. My employer offers large overtime incentives, which should be decreasing and I assume I'll make $100,000ish in 2023.

My goal is to max my 403b, 457b, Roth IRA, HSA plus a couple thousand extra into a brokerage account. 

Yes, rent is expensive but the way I see it owning a house is a lot of work. I don't have to deal with any sort of maintenance where I live now, I don't have a family and I am perfectly content with what I have.

A decent house would probably be in the $200-300K range where I live.

I keep a pretty low balance in my savings ($8500), have $33,000 in easily liquefiable assets, mostly my brokerage account. While selling would incur capital gains, I have losses from last year I can carry forward to offset them. And an additional $72000 between retirement accounts and my HSA.

plgayk,swaggy_butthole,"(US) Trying to plan for retirement (22), what is the best way to allocate my funds? I have a 403b, 457 b and roth IRA

I am 22, and I live in Kentucky. My base income is $58,500/year. I plan on working overtime throughout the year; my place of work offers significant overtime pay, often an extra 40$ an hour or so (on rare occasions can be up to 80$ hour on top of regular pay) where I usually make about $30 an hour.

I don't think it's important to spell out my expenses here; I live well within my means and limit spending wherever possible. My plan is to retire as early so I am planning for that now. I have roughly 4 months of expenses saved up as cash as well as liquefiable assets (crypto and stocks.) I have no loans or debts whatsoever.

So, as far as retirement goes I have the 403, 457b and roth IRA as my options. I also have an HSA. So balancing these funds in the most advantageous way possible is my goal here.

**What I've been doing**

My employer offers a 200% match for my 403b, up to 5% of my pay so that's a no brainer (I made a post before that mentioned this and people mentioned over and over how that's not possible, no one does a 200% match, etc. Yes, it is 200%, I am positive.)

On top of that, I've been putting $500/month into my Roth, $200/month into my 457b, and $200/month into my HSA (my employer also contributes $1000/year into my HSA).

**What I'm thinking about doing**

Employer matching is only available for the 403b, so that portion definitely needs to stay

I am thinking about completely striking the roth contribution from my retirement plan. From my research, the 457 and 403b seem to perform better. over time (assuming tax savings are re-invested.) 

Since I am taxed at about 31% (state, local and national). I might have done my math wrong there, so if anyone thinks it should be different let me know. but taking away the $500 a month from the roth would leave me with about $700 a month to invest. I think the best move is to try to max out my 457 if possible, it seems to be objectively superior to the 403b, especially since I plan on retiring earlier.

I dont expect any major health costs anytime soon, but there is the HSA I have to think about as well. I am thinking what I might do is add $500/month into my 457 and $250 a month into my HSA with the money left after taking out my roth contribution.

I have only been working for 3 months (pretty much fresh out of college) and haven't had a chance to work overtime yet. I would like to make enough to max out my 457 this year at which point I would probably contribute any extra savings into either my HSA or possibly my 403b

is the roth even worth touching? It sounds great if you're low income but I can't imagine my income bracket would be higher in retirement than it is now.

For reference, I make $26 an hour, roughly $31 with my shift differentials. Paychecks are bi-weekly

My most recent paycheck I increased my retirement contribution by $200 a paycheck. I also only made $2163.95. Fed withholding tax is only 7.8% of my post deduction income.

After all deductions, I get to keep around $760/2 weeks. This is just barely enough to cover living expenses. I work overtime if I want something like a vacation or a fun night out, but most of that extra money from overtime goes into my Roth IRA and other investments (other taxable accounts.)

In 2016 my dad died. He was a lifelong academic (professor) and had his retirement invested in TIAA. My mother handled his finances and was extremely risk-averse, so everything was placed in either an annuity or a money market account.

My mother died last year (2022). My sister and I are the named beneficiaries on the TIAA account.

Instead, my choices are to either stay in the existing plan as a beneficiary or take a full lump sum payout (with all of the tax implications that entails).

I am trying to find somebody to contact to see if these shares still exist. It might be that my mother sold them immediately, but I have no record of any sale. My mother passed away last year.

I've been on Berkshire Hathaway Energy's website but can't find any contact information.

Does anyone have any advice for how I might determine if the shares are still in my mother's name?",,,,,
ydex2i,tadhg555,"How to track down Treasury bond information for deceased relative

Apologies if this is the wrong sub to post this question.

My mother recently passed away. Unfortunately she did not keep very good records, and in sorting through her files I've noticed a number of notes she kept indicating that she may have purchased T-bills or bonds at some point (e.g., a lot of references to TreasuryDirect, etc.).

Here's my question: If I only have her Social Security number, but no actual account number for TreasuryDirect (nor any individual bond numbers), is there any way that I can find out if she holds any bonds?

What would happen to those bonds now that she's dead?

yjhi8h,tadhg555,"Question about financial planners

I am looking for a financial planner to help me manage investments. I know that I want to use a fiduciary, but I am a little unclear on how the process works.

Would the CFP actually manage my funds, or would they simply provide advice on what I might do?

For example, if they recommended that I invest in a mutual fund (say Fidelity), would they do that for me, or would I need to open an account with Fidelity?

I ask because I would prefer to avoid a situation where I am getting conflicting advice (from my CFP and whomever would be assigned to my account with Fidelity).

yo8wjs,tadhg555,"Confused about advisors

Following up on an earlier postâ€¦ My wife and I recently came into some money and we are looking for some professional guidance.

My inclination is toward a flat-fee fiduciary with whom we could discuss our goals and risk tolerance, and who would work with us to develop a financial plan for our investments. We would then implement the plan, and if necessary return to this person to discuss any major changes in the years to come (paying as needed for future consultations).

Hereâ€™s where I am confused: nearly every person I have spoken to who has a financial planner works with someone at a wealth management firm who handles their investments for a percentage (usually around 1% or so). 

These are very smart people whom I would trust on most any other topics, so I am surprised that they seem unconcerned about the amount they are spending.

Am I missing something? Is there a benefit to having a money manager on retainer that Iâ€™m not seeing? Do they have access to a level of investment that I wouldnâ€™t be able to get on my own (shorts, etc.)?

ywfgut,tadhg555,"Increasing payroll deductions to offset RMD?

I have a somewhat naive question about inherited IRAs and the tax impact of potential RMDs. If the tax rules change (as it appears they might) and beneficiaries again have to take yearly RMDs, I was wondering if it  makes sense to increase the amount that one contributes to a pre-tax 401k in order to offset any increase in taxable income.

For example, let's say I currently make $100,000/year and contribute 10% to my pre-tax 401k. Then let's say that my RMD for 2023 will be $10,000. If I increase my pre-tax 401k contributions to 20%, would that effectively keep my taxable income the same?

Does it work that way?",,,,,

My mother passed away last month, and I am trying to make sense of her estate. I am going to be meeting with a financial planner and a CPA, but I wanted to see if anyone had insight into a specific issue I'm dealing with.

I understand the 10-year rule regarding any inherited IRA I receive, but I was wondering about any RMDs that my mother was responsible for before she died.

My mother did not take the 2022 RMD from her IRA, so my understanding is that her brokerage will distribute that amount to me and I will be required to pay any taxes on it based on my current tax bracket.

However, the coroner has not yet determined an official cause of death for my mother (due to issues at the hospital), and it's doubtful that I will legally be able to settle her estate and receive anything until 2023. (I am a named beneficiary for the IRA, but they need a death certificate with cause of death to finalize any transaction.)

If I can't receive my mother's 2022 RMD until next year, will I be subject to the IRS' 50% penalty, or can they forgive it given the extenuating circumstances? How do I notify the IRS about this?",,,,,
hh2lc8,TaeTwoTimes,"How To Refinance Personal Loan?

So about a year ago I eagerly wanted to get one of cars over always wanted , only issue was it wasnâ€™t within the 10 year model year limit my banking institution gives out Car loans to so I had to take out a personal loan for it through them. Yes, I know I shouldâ€™ve shopped around to other banks and see who could do an actual car loan but the car probably wouldâ€™ve sold if I waited another day and I didnâ€™t have the cash at that time. So my question is , the loan is through my primary credit union. Have all my accounts through them , is it possible to refinance this loan through another bank And if so how do I go about it and when I do refinance will it effect my credit since the age of that existing open account will close Iâ€™m assuming ? Itâ€™s a crazy interest rate of about 14% on this and still owe 9k paying around 305 a month and only about a little over half of that goes to the actual principal ,initially I didnâ€™t care due to the excitement of the car but now I realize it was foolish. Iâ€™m 21 have about 20k put away and  have a good job. I can pay this off and it wouldnâ€™t really effect me but I like keeping liquid capital to play around and invest with.

Didnâ€™t get any responses on my last post, so Iâ€™ll try again. 


Hey all, I've been checking in on my retirement portfolio lately, and I have a few questions.  I'll list all my info first


33, married, first baby due in September


Currently maxing out my 401(k) and my Roth IRA, here's my combined portfolio between both accounts: (percentages are rounded)


25.5%  VTSAX (entire Roth IRA)

25%  FSPSX

16%  FXAIX

9.5%  FIDELITY CONTRAFUND (benchmark is S&amp;P 500, but only has 300 funds and different weighting. Also higher expense ratio)

7.5%  DFEVX

6%  MPC (a mistake, I know)

6%  FSMAX

3%  DODIX

.5%  VBMPX


Overall allocation:

63%  US Equity

32.5%  INTL Equity

3.5%  Bond/income


1)  I bought MPC through the employee stock purchase program in my 401(k) when everyone thought they were doing great.  Since then, the stock has done nothing but drop, and I am down about $4k from my total cost basis (25% of my MPC investment).  I still believe the stock will get back to where it was and beyond, but I don't know how long that will take.  When do you cut your losses on an investment?  I know I'm losing money on not being invested in something like FXAIX that is producing returns.  Should I hold or sell?

2)  Do I have redundant holdings?  Should I try to reduce down to 4-5 holdings or is it not that big of a deal?  Fees aren't really an issue.  My most expensive holding is DFEVX at .64% gross exp ratio.


3)  How should I use my money after I max out my 401(k)?  I put back 17% of my paycheck, and I will probably max out in October or November.  I can still get a 7% employer match through after-tax contributions.  I don't have much retirement savings outside of my 401(k) and Roth IRA.

fg3scc,Teddyworks,"Windfall advice, and also some retirement savings tax treatment

We could use some advice on our current situation. Weâ€™ll be having a windfall from the sale of a rental property soon. After paying off the mortgage, we should have about $25k leftover. Weâ€™re trying to figure out how to handle it. 
 
Me: 33
My wife: 28
First child due in September!!

**Income:**

Me: $120k minimum (hourly employee with plenty of overtime opportunities)
Wife: $60k

**Debt:**

$120k mortgage at 3.25%

**Savings and investments:**

$7k high-yield savings
$8k HSA (maxing out)
$120k 401(k) (maxing out)
$40k my Roth IRA (maxing out)
$8k her Roth IRA 
$4k Fidelity brokerage

**1.)** How should we use the $25k windfall?  We have considered paying it all as a principal payment on our current mortgage, or using it all to begin investing more in our brokerage account. Most likely would be in an index fund. I know I could probably have higher returns than 3.25% in the stock market, but it would also be a huge weight off our shoulders if we paid off the mortgage by the time Iâ€™m 40 too...

**2.)** We also plan to start maxing out her IRA. We have been thinking more about using a traditional IRA. Our AGI was $173k after our 2019 tax returns. It will lower a little bit next year after selling our rental property. If we used a traditional IRA, it might drop us down to the 22% bracket? I have always been confused on how to handle this situation, but I basically just split my savings 50/50 between pre-tax and after-tax. I can save Roth contributions in my 401k as well.

So we have a rather interesting family situation so itâ€™s a little tough to describe. Weâ€™re in the *VERY* early stages of this discussion, so Iâ€™m just trying to get a decent handle on things before more serious discussions and talking to lawyers and bankers. 

Essentially, my wife and I live on a 1 acre lot (we own) in the middle of a family owned (her family) farm land. We expected to have this land passed down to us (although I knew things might get complicated someday). 

Now, a family member that is the main executor (not sure thatâ€™s the right term) of the revocable trust wants to sell their portion of ownership in order to move away and stay close to their son in their retirement. 

So now we own our home in this cornfield and we are somewhat in a tough spot. Itâ€™s a lot of money. We would roughly be buying 70 acres of farmland. Itâ€™s already rented out to a farmer. Thereâ€™s also oil wells and we would have mineral rights, although I donâ€™t believe theyâ€™re major producers. Iâ€™m guessing a few bpd for each of the 4 wells. 

Letâ€™s presume that the cash rent and oil payments would cover 80% of the yearly mortgage and tax payments (since I have no idea of the specifics, only taking my best guess). So some money would be coming out of our pocket. We can afford this, although not saying itâ€™s ideal. 

Generally, I stick to the Boglehead approach, but it sure seems like a lot of people around here buy up land like itâ€™s the best investment. I guess what Iâ€™m asking.. what kind of things do I need to think about ahead of buying? Obviously I donâ€™t know much about land ownership. What are some benefits that Iâ€™m not seeing?

I've always been a financially inclined guy, and always loved saving/investing/planning, etc.  I've been realizing more and more that I kind of feel like we're plateaued.  We could easily just continue on as we have been and have a fantastic retirement and all those normal things.  We also feel like we are capable of more, and being a Boglehead.. it's very hard to feel like you're accomplishing much (even though you are).

&amp;#x200B;

So we're kind of looking for ideas.  I've really been thinking we need to meet with a CFP, which is on our outlook as well.  I'll give a quick rundown of our financials

&amp;#x200B;

**\*\*Income (combined) -\*\***

\- 2021 AGI $185k

**\*\*Debts -\*\***

\- Home - $108k 14 years left @ 2.25% (Appraised at $165k)

\- Minivan - $18k 3 years left @ 2.5%

**\*\*Savings -\*\***

\- HYSA - $35k (emergency &amp; large upcoming expense)

\- Brokerage - $50k (mostly S&amp;P500)

\- 401k - $250k (Pre-tax)(max-out every year)

\- Roth IRA - $95k (both accounts combined/ max both out every year)

&amp;#x200B;

So we had saved up to remodel our kitchen which is why we have such a large savings.  Well we got to that point and we really weren't inclined to follow through.  Then we got word of a future opportunity to buy a large amount of income producing farm-ground from family (roughly 80 acres @ $6k-$10k/acre).  So we've kind of held on to this money to see how that situation turns out.

&amp;#x200B;

We're now kind of at an impasse.  The farm-ground purchase could go either way, and still might be a few years out before its available.  We've considered real estate, but our schedules are so hectic, that I'm not sure it's viable for our happiness/marriage quality (we both work shift work).  Rentals are promising if they're quality properties that wouldn't need much renovating/maintenance.  We're in a small town in Southern IL, so higher rent prices can be a tough sell.

&amp;#x200B;

We've kind of held off on paying down our debt because the rates are so dang low, and we feel we have a pretty safe cushion should something happen.

&amp;#x200B;

Perhaps I just need to vent, but surely I'm not the only one to have this struggle between wanting to do more investing yet not having a whole lot of time to give.",,,,,

p4mng2,TheRealMulli,"401(k) questionâ€¦

The company I work for matches 50% up to 6% of pre-tax income so with that and reading around the webs about contributing 15%-20% of your gross income and since I get paid weekly, how much should I invest per paycheck? I put down 10% per paycheck and I get paid about $420 per week so thatâ€™s $42 a week into my 401(k). Am I doing too much or is this fine? 

I was going to follow the 50/30/20 rule and since 20% goes to savings I figured Iâ€™d take 10% weekly and put into my companyâ€™s 401(k) and the other 10% will go into my personal savings.

But could yâ€™all let me know if this is a good plan atm

So as I said I bring home about $420/week and if I break that down via the 50/30/20 rule, that gives me $210/week for needs, $126/week for wants and $84/week for savings. 

Needs are around $550/month, Wants run about $50/month and then after the 10% contribution into my works 401(k) Iâ€™d have $42 left per week to throw into personal savings.

So Iâ€™m starting to budget and trying to get a hold on my money and am currently looking at going with the 50/30/20 Rule. My question is since I mostly see that 401(k) is counted along with the 20% savings, how should I go along breaking down my weekly check via this rule?

For my 401(k) I do 6% cuz my employer matches up to 50% of the first 6%

So to break it down imma low ball on how much I usually bring home per week:

$400/wk (itâ€™s usually more than this by maybe $20-$40, but to be on the safe side Iâ€™ll say only $400)

Now Iâ€™ve got two bank accounts, one at Ally and the other at Capital One. Ally is for bills and emergency fund since they have the savings buckets so each paycheck Iâ€™ve got 70% going into my Ally Checking which then I split up into needs and savings. The remaining 30% of my paycheck goes to Capital One for my Daily Checkingâ€™s for you guessed it wants and daily stuff. 

My question is, since the 401(k) is taken into consideration for the 20% savings and Iâ€™m only putting in 6% into that, that means Iâ€™ve got 14% left to budget into an emergency fund savings so with that 70% Iâ€™m putting into my Ally account, should I divvy it up as 56% into my Bills and then that 14% into emergency fund or just keep it as is 50% still into Needs and 20% still into Savings?

Hey everyone! I had a business go under last August where I had to refund almost all of our clients. When I ran out of money to refund them, I asked them all to open PayPal disputes to get their money back. Since August Iâ€™ve had a negative $44,000 PayPal balance.

gk1qol,thesonofnarcs,"Iâ€™m 24 years old and heavily in debt - how can I thrive while paying it off and get past the shame, paralysis, and fear Iâ€™m feeling?

Hey everyone! Iâ€™m a 24 year old guy living with my parents. 

I just graduated college in December after 5.5 years. 

From 2016 through the summer of 2019 I built what got to be a large, fast growing, and successful business until I closed it in August last summer. 

Over the course of almost four years I worked with hundreds of clients and built a name for myself until it all came crashing down. 

I had only paid myself $1,000 a month as a salary and mistakenly reinvested every penny back in the business without any kind of cushion or saving anything for myself. 

The failed business left me heavily, heavily in debt at 23 years old. $68k to be exact 

Iâ€™m an entrepreneur to my core. At 24 Iâ€™ve never had a â€œreal jobâ€ working for anyone but myself. 

Iâ€™ve been working on launching a new business, but the shame, anxiety, and fear has lead to mental paralysis. 

Itâ€™s just this big secret Iâ€™m keeping.

While I am paying them $500 a month for rent, My parents have no clue. They arenâ€™t very supportive of me being an entrepreneur as it is and we are on shaky ground relationship wise because of it. They make good money but they couldnâ€™t help even if they wanted to.

I got myself into this mess and somehow some way will get out of it myself. 

Throughout last fall and early this year Iâ€™ve went to each creditor one by one and explained my situation. Theyâ€™ve all been very understanding. 

The payment plans Iâ€™m on with each creditor are manageable and very, very long term (two creditors make up 75% of what I owe and both have me on 4 year payment plans), but just the thought of having that much debt for such a long time is causing me so much anxiety. 

None of the debt is on my credit report. My score is 680. 

The one thing that scares me to death is the UCC lien Kabbage filed for the the loan I took toward the end of the business.

I guess my question is how do you remain productive and at peace mentally while in debt? How do you pace yourself? 

Iâ€™m a big thinker and am not the most patient person. The thought of it potentially taking 4 years to be debt free alone leaves me paralyzed mentally if that makes sense. 

I just keep pushing myself to find a way to make more money faster. Itâ€™s put me in this never ending spiral of churning through business ideas and chasing money.",,,,,

i5h02m,thesonofnarcs,"Why you have to look beyond the balance sheet: A Cautionary Tale

For almost 7 years I was a dyed in the wool value investor. I did very well. 

As I would look back on stocks I passed on investing over the years I saw many of them went to zero or close to it. 

So, I got the bright idea of using LEAP put options on companies I would never go long on. 

I started in the casino, hotel, and resort space. I spent two weeks one by one researching and then ranking each company based from strongest to weakest on all the metrics and benchmarks Graham talks about in the Intelligent Investor (interest coverage, what their bonds yielded, working capital, credit rating, etc.)

My goal was to find the absolute weakest company in the sector/industry. A company with an atrocious balance sheet that was barely surviving. 

In my mind I thought it would be the perfect one to bet against. 

I found it. It was Penn National Gaming (PENN). They ranked number one as the weakest company. They have billions in debt, negative working capital, negative tangible book value, and not enough money before tax to cover the interest payment.

They have had to continually issue new shares and dilute their stock. Their current shares outstanding are 200% higher than they were 4 years ago. 

PENN reached a low of $3.50 during the March crash. When I finished my research it was at $28.

My thesis was that with the company being in such horrible financial shape and their casinos being closed for so long would take the stock back down and potentially make the company file Chapter 11. 

Even if their casinos reopened I did not think that they could survive on a fraction of their former traffic. 

With all that in mind it seemed like it was possible for the stock to go back to what it was in March. 

I had such conviction I invested $1,000 in puts with a $3 strike that expire in January.

I made one big mistake. I didnâ€™t know about Dave Portnoy when I initiated my position. I didnâ€™t think Barstool could generate enough revenue to save them. 

Dave Portnoy is the equivalent of Elon Musk in the sports world. Just like Elonâ€™s tweets move Tesla Portnoy has been able to move PENN.

I donâ€™t blame him. I just made the mistake of overestimating the influence one person can have on a stock. 

Today the stock is worth $49. I bought my puts when stock was at $28. 

Iâ€™m down 70%. The money I lost does sting, but it doesnâ€™t bother me. 

I went in knowing I could lose it all or make 42X my money. I saw it as an asymmetric bet. 

But, at 24 years old this lesson will stick with me the rest of my investing career.

I owe PayPal $40,000 from a failed business two years ago when I was 23

In the spring of 2020 after not hearing from them for almost 7 months I emailed the executive team/CEO and told them my story. 

I asked for a payment plan. 

Some high level executive had the COO of the debt collection agency they contract with (meaning they didnâ€™t sell the balance) call me personally and oversee my account. 

He was managing my account personally (meaning the main agency wasnâ€™t calling and it wasnâ€™t in their teams system). He knew my story and basically just said to pay when I can and what I can and that PayPal would be monitoring my payments.

I paid off $4,000 of it in a year. 

Today I called to make a payment and was told that the account was removed from the agency and to call PayPal. 

My hope was that it was sent to another agency that I could set up a new payment plan with.

I called PayPal and was told it was back in house with them. 

I guess I wasnâ€™t paying fast enough?

The problem is they donâ€™t and wonâ€™t accept or set up Payment plans because itâ€™s not a line of credit and thereâ€™s no interest (itâ€™s just a negative balance).

They said that I can call and make partial payments as often as I want but thereâ€™s nothing to setup. 

The lady in the collections department also didnâ€™t know how long theyâ€™ll keep it in house.

They also wonâ€™t settle. The collection agency was willing to knock $10,000 off.

Iâ€™m a little freaked out by all the ambiguity from PayPal. I had a smaller balance with them in another account (that Iâ€™ve since paid off) from the same business and they called my parents house at all hours.

I currently work as a driver for a federal contractor, which is dependent on passing a security clearance, which is unlikely. So I will be looking for another job soon. I think my earning potential is anywhere from $18,000 to $40,000 a year, depending on the job.  
Right now, my expenses are very low because I live with my parents, rent free. They also pay for my car insurance and phone bill.  
My only recurring expenses are gas, health insurance, and dental insurance.  
Until my current job asks me to leave, I plan to use my money to:  
Get a root canal  
Take care of car maintenance and repairs that I've been putting off  
Move into an apartment  
File for chapter 7 bankruptcy  
From there, I will find another job, and begin to:  
Pay off student loans  
Save for a condo  
And then begin my path to financial independence. Any advice, tips, or tricks on my plan?",,,,,
175ja8s,TheVoicesTalkToMe,"Budgeting for Therapy

I have BPD. Therapists trained in DBT, which is recommended for BPD, generally only accept one insurance in network. That's fine. I'm paying $140 a month for that one specific insurance. Next, there is a long waiting list to become a patient. That's fine. However, the biggest issue is that they charge anywhere from $100-$175 a session, and treatment requires a session each week. Treatment is minimum six months to a year to see improvement, two years until I can reasonably expect BPD to no longer severely impact my life. 

  
That's $400 on the low end to $700 on the high end \*each month\* just for therapy. Plus the $140 for health insurance. 

  
I'm making $18/hour plus an extra $4/hour bonus at my job, so it's combined $22/hour. This is the high end for salary for my occupation.

Hello! Quick question for you all.

I have a 2016 Honda Civic, which I love. I got it when I was in college and it's treated me very well. It's been on a lot of road trips with me and as a result it's got about 160,000 miles on the odometer. Despite the high miles, it still runs well, and the only expenses I've incurred with it are routine upkeep (tires, brakes, fluids, etc.). And the body is still in beautiful shape.

My question is this -- does it make more financial sense to trade in periodically, or should I run my Honda until the wheels fall off? A local dealership estimates I could get around $12,000-$15,000 for it given the current state of the car market, and I could afford to level up to a newer Civic or Accord with lower miles. On the other hand, I could probably continue to drive this car for another five years (or more), though the trade-in value by then will probably be next to nothing.

So, which scenario makes more financial sense? Trade in and bank a good chunk of money to put toward a newer model with fewer miles, or run the car until it dies, at which time I'll have to buy a new car without the benefit of being able to trade in my Civic for the cost of half the new car?

ryvmez,throwaway_4829890973,"My car was totaled and now I'm (unfortunately) in the market for a new one. Should I buy used or new, and should I finance or pay in full?

Hi!

Earlier this week, I allowed my mom to borrow my car. As it turns out, this was a big mistake. On her way home, she got into an accident and totaled the car (she was fine, thankfully). My car was a 2016 Honda Civic -- cheap to maintain, reliable, and fully paid off. Needless to say, I was really hoping not to have a car payment for the foreseeable future -- especially given the fact that I recently graduated from college and wanted to put all the money I possibly could toward a downpayment on a home and invest the rest.

But, unfortunately, I am now in the market for another car. My insurance payout will help, but my car had high miles, and therefore there's still going to be at least a $10,000 gap between the value of my old Civic and the value of a newer model (I will probably buy a Honda Insight, which is essentially a hybrid version of the Civic). Obviously, this is a terrible time to be in the market for a car, as prices have inflated at least 35% on used cars.

So, given this less-than-ideal situation, what is the most financially responsible thing to do? I can either pay for a new Honda that will likely last a decade or more, or I can pay slightly less for a used Honda that may not have been maintained properly by the previous owner and may not last as long due to previous use. Also, I can afford to pay for the car in full, but I think it may be more financially prudent to secure a low APR loan and invest the money I would otherwise be spending to pay the car off in full.

Advice would be greatly appreciated. Thank you all so much.

EDIT: I can get a 2022 Honda Insight for $26,500 or a used model for a couple thousand dollars less. Even the equivalent of what I had (2016 Honda Civic) would be around $20,000 for a model with under 50,000 miles. Really an awful time to be in the market for a car.",,,,,

Hi, everyone!

Unfortunately, my car was recently totaled by another driver, and I am now in need of another car for everyday use. However, I will likely be leaving the country for an extended period in four months, which complicates this situation. I can either buy a used car (Honda) at an inflated price, considering the current state of the used car market, or I can opt for something a bit more unconventional: I could buy a new Honda Accord, use it for a few months, and then sell it back (either to a dealership or on the private market) when it comes time to leave.

Considering the current value of used cars (which I don't imagine will go down much in only a few months), I think this may be a decent way for me to give myself a means of transportation while recouping most of my money down the road.

Is this something that would be financially wise, in your opinion, or do you think used car values will start to deflate sooner than April?

My 2016 Honda Civic (160,000 miles) was totaled by another driver recently, so I am unfortunately in the market for another car. I am anticipating a \~$15,000 payout from the insurance company -- which would be enough to get me into another high-mileage Civic, but I'm not sure it would be wise to pay for a used car that has 160,000 miles already. 

**So, I am left in a bind. As you are probably aware, used car prices have increased 35% over the last year. That in mind, I have found several 2016-2018 Honda Accords with \~50,000-70,000 miles for between $23,000 and $26,000 OTD, while a new Accord with zero miles would cost me closer to $30,000 OTD.** 

The same is true of Civics: used Civics with \~75,000 miles are often selling for only slightly less (and sometimes more!) than \*new\* Civics, so I would be in the same situation if I decided to buy another Civic (but I would prefer an Accord).

I am also factoring anticipated depreciation into my calculus. As the used car market begins to cool down over the next year or two, I would expect a used Accord priced at $24,000 now to lose a third of its value or more, which is a huge waste of money and probably even worse in terms of depreciation than a new Accord.

I know buying new is typically frowned upon in this sub, but considering the state of the used car market right now, which do you think is the better choice?",,,,,
sf991d,throwaway_4829890973,"What's the wiser decision: Pay car in cash to avoid fixed-rate debt, or take a 1.9% APR car loan and risk market volatility and invest most of the money in VOO?

I'm purchasing a car next week. I've been offered a 1.9% APR loan, which I understand is very good. I'm considering making a small downpayment and investing the rest in VOO or another solid ETF, but concerned about the short-term volatility of the market vs. fixed-rate debt I'll be incurring (it's probably unlikely, but possible that the ETF could underperform the 1.9% interest rate of the loan). 

Keen to hear opinions on which would be the wiser decision.",,,,,
sfvbg2,throwaway_4829890973,"I have a large sum of money that I want to invest. Would I be relatively safe to put it all in VTI and let it sit?

Hi, everyone!

I'm a recent college graduate and recently was fortunate to receive $160,000. I am debt-free (except for a small $2,500 car loan at 1.9% APR that I'm using to build credit) and have a substantial emergency fund of $15,000, plus additional savings of $25,000. My 401k and IRA are maxed out for the year.

The money has been sitting in a savings account since I received it because I'm not sure which ETF (or ETFs) to put the money in. I'll probably either throw all of it ($175,000) in VTI, or put 60% of it in VTI and 40% in VSUX.

I've spent countless hours researching how to invest this money and I'm honestly ready to be done with it. Thoughts on this plan?

Thanks!

P.S. -- I'm a little concerned about the potential for a stock market crash in the near future. I've heard a lot of speculation in the media about this. I know it's generally foolish to try to time the market, but I'd feel pretty dumb if I invested $175,000 in the stock market right before a crash. Should I wait to invest, or just make the jump now?",,,,,

sq6jih,throwaway_4829890973,"Will closing a new credit card negatively impact my credit score?

At the end of January, I applied and was approved for a Discover credit card. I have a good credit score (757) and already have several open credit cards, so I didn't think there'd be any issues. However, I was contacted by Discover yesterday and asked to consent to an IRS tax return check. I'm very uncomfortable with a credit card company thumbing through my tax returns, so I politely declined and closed my account.

As I said, the account was less than two weeks old, and I never actually used it. Will closing my Discover card hurt my credit score?",,,,,
u8xv0w,throwaway_4829890973,"I need to offload a car that is almost brand-new. Should I sell it back to the dealership or try a private-party sale?

Hi!

I bought a new Honda Accord back in January for $1,000 below sticker price (which shocked me at the time). Almost four months later, it has approximately 3,500 miles and I need to sell it because I will be moving out of the country (I did not know about this when I purchased the car). I have a couple of months to offload the car, so I am not desperate to take the first offer someone gives me, and I would ideally like to sell the car at as little a loss as possible. Is this reasonable given the state of the used car market? And, additionally, I had planned to take a road trip with my family next month before I move abroad -- would you advise me to rent a car, or would the devaluation of an additional \~3,000 miles on the odometer be negligible?

yfv28f,throwaway_4829890973,"My uncle unfortunately passed recently and left me with a decent chunk of money. I don't want to squander it, so would I be better off investing in properties or an index fund?

Hi!

As I said in the title, my uncle recently passed and as a consequence I have been left with a decent chunk of money (around $200,000). I'm not exactly sure what to do with it yet, but I am certain that I want to use it to build further wealth rather than squander it by letting it sit in a bank account or some other low-interest vehicle. 

I have thought about putting it all into an ETF (such as VTI), especially considering I'd be buying at a significant discount relative to when it was selling for $240/share last year. However, my preference would be to use a significant portion of the money to build a stream of passive income, probably by investing in a rental property or two. 

Having a source of monthly income would be ideal because I am currently a student and don't have much of an income to speak of. 

Any advice would be welcome! Very interested to hear feedback and to know what others would do if you were in my situation.

Thanks!",,,,,
rvtcip,throwback656,"Is it a pragmatic decision to park your emergency fund in I-series bonds?

So I usually have a 10K USD rainy day/emergency fund. The rest of my money is parked in ETFs. As soon as I get my salary, I take out a chunk of it and transfer it to my Brokerage account and buy index funds with it.    


Now, with I-series bonds offering 7.12% interest. I am tempted to invest my rainy day/emergency fund into it. I will have 1000 dollars in my bank account for emergencies. If push comes to shove, I can always liquidate my ETF holdings and I will have cash in my bank account in 3 to 4 days.

ryxg1h,throwback656,"From a taxes POV strictly, is it meaningless to donate to charities if I am claiming the standard deduction.

Before I get downvoted to oblivion for asking this, the charities that I donate to mean a lot to me. I never donated to them as a means of avoiding taxes. No matter what people tell me today, I will continue to donate to them.  


Now I claim standard deduction every year. I am a salaried employee. Single. With just some dividend and capital gains income on the side. I don't own an apartment or a car. Given all of this, the standard deduction is the best for me. But in a given year I donate like 1000$ to 1500$ to charities. Is there a way I can get a sort of tax write-off for those donations?

soo01i,throwback656,"I am trying to debate if I should see my old dentist vs a new one closer to my home.

I used to see a dentist close to my office for a dental cleaning and stuff. He took an X-Ray of my whole mouth barely 6 months ago. Now I switched jobs and I found a new dentist closer to my home and she has great reviews on Google/Yelp.

My new insurance only allows a full mouth X-Ray once in 3 years. And since I have new insurance she wants to do a brand new X-Ray of my whole mouth again. I got a copy of my X-Rays which at this point is barely 6 months old and she is refusing to use those :| She wants to do an X-Ray again. This is just a routine dental checkup/cleaning that I get every 6 months.

I have two concerns at this point. (1) If I do have to get an X-Ray maybe next year for an actual problem, I would have to pay for it out of pocket. (2) I don't want to get an X-Ray for no justifiable reason. X-rays are radiation. Just because it is free, I am not going to bombard my mouth with radiation, because this dentist can bill my insurance company an extra 100$.

On the whole, to me, it feels like the dentist is just being greedy. I called her and asked her why she wants to get another X-Ray and she is like because it is free. I want to get my own X-Ray done.

Should I just stick with my old dentist even though he lives far away from me? What will happen if I just go to this Dentist and refuse to get an X-Ray?

I spent the whole of today going through my transactions trying to

(2) My Section 199A dividends satisfy the holding period.  
(3) Find the cost basis for the small portion of the gold that the gold ETF I held(IAU) sold last year to cover its expenses. (15 cents)

At this point, I am really vexed with this whole process. According to Turbotax, I will probably get 200$ back if my qualified dividends are actually qualified dividends. And the gold ETF sold 15 cents worth of gold last year.  


Can I just mark all of my qualified dividends as ordinary dividends and the 15 cents that IAU sold last year as income?
