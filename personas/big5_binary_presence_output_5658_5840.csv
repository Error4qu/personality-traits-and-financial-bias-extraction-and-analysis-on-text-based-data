mhkr5u,Strife025,"Advice for finding a Fee Based Advisor to answer some questions (i.e. one time meeting)

I'm at the point in my life (36) and with a large enough overall portfolio that I have some more complicated questions I think would make more sense asking a professional and paying $500 or whatever it costs one time to set a more concise strategy for the next 10-15 years.

I'm less concerned about fund choices since I invest in a few indexes and don't want someone to actively manage my portfolios or sell me products, it's more about allocations between account types, overall asset allocation, tax questions, and some of the more complex strategies and if it's applicable to me (i.e. mega-backdoor Roth IRA since my company allows post-tax contributions after the $19.5K limit) since I max out my 401K and Roth IRA already and I'd like to reduce my taxable brokerage investments in the future as a % of my overall assets.

I searched on NAPFA but there's a ton of different firms around me and it's hard to figure out who is good. I don't have any personal contacts that have a recommendation, just wondering if anyone has tips before I randomly start trying to search around for someone? Also anyone have a clue what a typical hourly rate would be?",Yes,Yes,No,Yes,No
mi1kx1,Strife025,"Balancing between Traditional, Roth, and Mega-backdoor Roth contributions

Alright so this is a bit of a complicated question and there's probably not one good answer, but figured I'd see if anyone has good insight.

I put together a spreadsheet of my current annual income and estimated expenses with precise tax calculations based on Fed/State tax tables for 2021: [Imgur Income](https://i.imgur.com/AznsIi3.png)

I'm currently saving a large portion of my income mainly because I live well below my means and don't feel the need to spend money.

The Summary is:

* 138K gross

* 47K-40K taxes depending on 401k contribution options

* ~28K expenses

* 65K-71K Assets (depending on taxes)

In the next couple of years I expect to buy a Condo and my expense obligations would go up ~18K (mid scenario) still allowing me to save ~50K/yr.

I'm 36, single (ended a 5yr in Feb), and have really been analyzing my portfolio this year (less about individual fund allocations and more overall strategy between accounts for tax purposes). In the past, I've just been doing 401K traditional, Roth IRA, and rest into individual taxable/HYSA. I'm at the point where I have too much money in non-retirement because I haven't been utilizing all my retirement account options (I didn't max my 401K or HSA in the past). 

I'm also trying to figure out how best to balance with Traditional 401K if I start doing mega-backdoor Roth. My 401K plan with Fidelity allows for after tax contributions which I started this paycheck, I also called them and they confirmed that I can do in-service withdrawals on after tax dollars and theoretically I have the ability to do mega-backdoor although the rep wouldn't advise me on the process.

**Current Assets:**

* $6K HSA

* $100K HYSA (emergency fund/down payment)

* $137K Roth IRA

* $244K Traditional 401K

* $359K taxable non-retirement

**Questions:**

1. My plan is $75K/yr in net retirement income with a retirement goal of 60-65 mainly because I don't mind working right now (so could very well have more than I need). Assuming this is 401K/pre-tax dollars that would be ~$100K gross. Because this is lower than my current gross income of ~$138K I'm trying to figure out if it makes sense to continue traditional 401K or switch to Roth 401K (or some hybrid)

2. In relation to the above, I'm really trying to minimize contributions to non-taxable at this point and ""catch-up"" for retirement accounts. This is why I started to research into mega-backdoor Roth this year. My plan is to contribute ~20K post-tax dollars automatically from my paycheck into 401k and do an annual backdoor (so will still probably have some non-retirement contributions but way lower than the past). Knowing this, does it make sense to contribute $19.5K to traditional to lower my taxes ~$6K/yr if I'm putting $26K into Roth as well (vs $46K into Roth and none into Traditional and eating taxes now).

I posted about maybe finding a fee based financial/retirement planner yesterday for questions like this but people suggested just posting here instead first.. so wondering if anyone has good advice :x

mljo0s,Strife025,"Did I screw myself at all on Backdoor Roth IRA?

This is the first year I'm having to do a backdoor Roth IRA because I recently sold some positions in a taxable account with capital gains to simplify my portfolio and get out of high ER funds.

I originally contributed earlier in the year to Roth IRA like normal, so I had to have Fidelity recategorize my Roth IRA contribution I put in earlier in the year to a new traditional account. 

It just went through and they moved money to a new Trad. IRA account but because of gains I currently have $6,137 in there. My plan was to wait until the end of the month for the account statement showing I have a Traditional IRA then backdooring it back into my Roth IRA. I know usually they advise just keeping it in the money market so you don't gain/lose anything, since I have $6,137 in there currently though is this an issue?

I already submitted my tax returns back in early Mar and received my refund.

I did a big analysis of my portfolio and investment strategy over the past month and one thing I didn't do last year that I changed for this year is maxing out my HSA. I was reading that I can deposit directly into my HSA for 2020 contributions (usually its an automatic paycheck contribution) and then I'm assuming I update my taxes which would lower my taxable income.

I've never filed an amendment before and I usually use Turbotax but the software is saying ""...the IRS is still working on finishing up the Amended Return area (Form 1040X) for 2020. That means this area isn't quite ready yet.""

When would I typically be able to do this? I would be depositing almost $2K in my account for 2020 and I'm in the 24% Federal/9% CA State Bracket meaning I would get back an additional ~$660 in refunds I think.

navqhc,Strife025,"Practical TLH Question for today's market drop

So I've never actually TLH before but I rebalanced my portfolio earlier this year based on internet advice to simply into a 3 Fund Portfolio.

Currently my portfolio is setup in the following way:

* Taxable: Primarily VTI Total Market ETF, I sold a bunch of high ER mutual funds (.8-1.3) back in March to rebalance with a LTCG bill ($40K LTCG, ~$10K taxes because I live in CA so 15% + 9%)

* Roth IRA: 100% FSKAX Fidelity Total Market Mutual Fund

* 401K: Bonds, Total International, and a little bit of U.S. Equities to round out my 65/25/15 asset mix (due to limited 401K options the U.S. Equities are in a 5:1 blend of RS S&amp;P 500 and RS Sm &amp; Mid Cap funds)

As of today, my VTI holdings are down from $138K total cost basis to $135.5K. I would like to take advantage of TLH to sell/re-buy into a similar holding but since I've never done this before I'm not sure exactly what constitutes a wash sale for Index Funds. From my research it sounds like SCHB is an option as performance is near identical to VTI but one is an index against Dow Jones U.S. Broad Stock Market Index and the other is an index against CRSP US Total Market Index.

Also I have a margin account with Fidelity and my understanding is I can sell VTI and immediately re-buy SCHB before funds are settled without actually trading against margin so I'm not actually out of the market for any substantial period of time.

nnd40v,Strife025,"Advice on Condo Purchase based on Finances/Situation in HCOL area?

**Background:**

* 36 years old

* Live in Orange County, CA

* $880K NW, no debt: $10K emergency funds, $90K HYSA (downpayment), $360K Taxable Brokerage, $260K 401K, $150K Roth IRA, $8K HSA (3 Fund 65/20/15 overall portfolio not including HYSA &amp; emergency fund)

* Base Salary $126K + Profit Share = ~$140K-$145K total comp

Long story short, I basically put off purchasing a condo the past 3 years to buy a home with my ex after she finished her masters program and got a job. We recently broke up in Feb. after 5 years together and I no longer have the dual-income or need for a SFD in SoCal (like $800K+) so I'm trying to decide what to do. As everyone knows, this has come at a terrible time because the housing market is crazy.

A 1 story condo (no one above/below) with only 1 shared wall and 2 car garage is going up for sale in a neighborhood I like for $550K 1144 sq ft (this was my original price limit I set for myself)... but I fully expect it to sell for $575K-$600K based on my experience in this market and recent comps (have lost 2 offers previously). This is basically the closest I can get to an actual detached home at this price level for a condo...

On one hand I really want to own a place eventually, on the other hand I have a pretty good living situation currently and save a ton of money in a HCOL area. I've lived in a really nice 4bd/3bth 3K sq ft house with two other guys for the past 5 years, 1 mile from my job, in a nice neighborhood... I only pay $1050/mo. We have a $4,200/mo lease which has stayed the same for 5 years and one roommate has the master + office room so pays half.

**Thoughts:**

* To put an offer down I would need to sell more of my taxable investments (20% down or really no chance in this market), plus extra for closing costs, furniture, etc.

* Mortgage + Taxes + HOA + insurance would put me at a ~$2.8K monthly payment which is about the limit I'm comfortable with for my salary. My plan was to rent out a room but don't want to base my ability to make payments on that.

* I'm currently maxing my 401K, Roth IRA, HSA, + an extra ~$2K/mo, I wouldn't be saving the extra $2K anymore and may not be able to max out the 401K without a roommate if I purchased a place (accounting for maintenance, unexpected stuff, etc.)

* Buy vs rent calculators say renting is better if an equivalent place is less than ~$2K/mo (7 years staying put). It's kind of hard to compare because I have 2 roommates but also live in a nice house ($1K/mo) vs living in a smaller place (but my own) for $2.8K with the potential to rent out a room for $1K (net $1.8K). This puts both scenarios roughly the same financially if I rent out a room, so I'm basically trading more responsibility and dealing with a renter vs worry free living situation and not having to deal with any extra work.

Part of me thinks I should not buy a place for now and just keep saving aggressively until I actually need a place, the other part thinks that as I'm getting older I really should think about buying a place...

Just wanted to get people's thoughts from a financial perspective. Thanks.",No,Yes,No,Yes,No
obwh1x,Strife025,"Has anyone ever successfully appealed getting charged for ""preventative"" lab work?

Sounds like this is fairly common.. but I'm in my 30s, went in for preventative checkup which is supposed to be covered under my Blue Shield of CA PPO insurance.

Doctor visit was covered, but most of the blood work isn't even though it's what I imagine most people would consider preventative, so now I'm paying out of my deductible for it.

I called my insurance and they said the Venipuncture and Lipid panel is covered... but not Comprehensive Metabolic Panel, Hemoglobin, Complete Blood Count, or TSH 3rd-Gen.

Googling these makes it seem like they are all very common preventative tests especially something like Comprehensive Metabolic Panel... but I guess insurance wants to avoid paying for as much as possible.

Does everyone just bite the bullet and pay this stuff or tell their doctor they don't want these things in the future. Just seems kind of dumb that these basic things which can give you an early indicator on more serious issues (and huge bills) aren't considered preventative.

So I'm basically getting 50/50 split from friends &amp; family pushing me to get a new car vs driving what I have now, wanted to see what reddit thinks.

I'll preface this by saying it's not strictly financial, and I'm someone who is very frugal despite my income, think it's a combination of a few factors but thought this is maybe the best place to post this.

**Background:**

* 36 years old, driving the same 2001 civic since I was 16; bought new myself after working my ass off for 2 summers to put a down payment, cosigned by parents, continued to pay off thru college 

* $140-$150K/gross income, save ~$50K maxing out retirement accounts (401K, Roth IRA, HSA) + extra into taxable brokerage using 3-fund portfolio strategy

* Car also only has 134K miles on it as I don't drive much anymore, only drive ~5K miles/yr at this point. Live in SoCal suburbs though so still need a car with no public transportation and things a bit spread out.

Recently due to it's age some cosmetic stuff has been ""falling apart""; headliner is starting to separate in a couple spots, driver side tint starting to peel off, black rubber around window starting to dry out and peel off... nothing major but still kind of annoying. Also I have some work coming up in the near future for ~$1K (2nd new timing belt/water pump since 2009 was last time I replaced them, slight oil leak which needs new oil pump). 

Overall I think for the age it's in pretty good shape though, and yes I'm aware I'm 36 and driving a ""riced"" out civic still although it's not loud at least :):

With that all said, some F&amp;F telling me my car is still fine, just continue driving it. If you asked me this is what I would say as well... also hesitant to buy right now because of inflated market.

Other camp says I should drive something more age appropriate since I'm getting older and have disposable income, also added caveat that I recently got out of a 5 yr relationship and will need to date again soon... 

If I do buy something it will still be pretty conservative, maybe another civic or mazda 3 or a step up for a camry/accord. I really want a Lexus IS but can't justify the price for how little I drive...

Grandfather left trusts for three grandkids as beneficiaries.  He named his only living daughter a Kira as trustee.  Kira is not married, doesnâ€™t have kids or friends and is a spiteful person.  Trust is for health, education, maintenance and expense, and potentially gives the trustee leeway to make decisions on whether to disburse or not.  Trust also states that â€œKira cannot be removed for any reasonâ€.

Kira doesnâ€™t want the beneficiaries to have any money. Most requests are denied or have strings attached like they have to pay out of pocket for reimbursement which make it difficult to get anything.  Only things like medical or dental are for reimbursement, any other requests get flat out denied.  And still they need to be paid by the beneficiary first.

When beneficiaries ask questions about the trust, the trustee will not be direct and uses a tactic of charging an attorney large bills in the sum of $2000-5000 to answer questions on her behalf.  Trustee will make subtle jokes to the beneficiaries about not getting money â€” sent a birthday card  to one of the beneficiaries saying they get nothing.

I'm working with a local bank that is in 3 states nearby. It's a portfolio loan, so I didn't have many options.

**Note**: I have a ""Note Modification"" option on this mortgage which is, rate matching at some point in the future when they go down for a fee of $1000 once per year.

yvbwv7,Such_Occasion_5760,"Disability Insurance From Northwest Mutual

I'm a software engineer with a desk job. 29 yo, M, 180k/annum, married with 1 kid, stay-at-home wife

This is what I received from the Northwest mutual agent on the policy:

Q-1: Is it OWN or ANY occupation coverage? Could they deny the claim saying that I can work on anything else if I can't work on my own occupation anymore due to some reason?

\- The policy weâ€™re applying for is â€œmodified own occupation.â€ Our home officeâ€™s definition of that is â€œThe insured is totally disabled when both unable to perform the substantial and material duties of the regular occupation and not gainfully employed in any occupation.â€

Q-2: Does this policy have an alcohol/mental disability limitation?

Alcohol/drugs would not qualify for a claim. Mental disorders would qualify for a claim depending on how it affects your work functions (and assuming there are no exclusion riders for it during underwriting).

The policy designed for you has a benefit that lasts until Age 67.  


My employer offers 60% of base pay(125k) free of cost. And the benefit will be taxed. They will pay me 3900/month if I were to get disabled. The monthly premium is 38$, which goes up so is the payout amount. They used my current gross income(w2+other = 180K) and my current employer's disability policy payout to come up with 3900$ to make sure I get 100% of the paychecks when I'm disabled starting the 91st day of the policy effective until I'm 67. The benefit increases with inflation or pay rises and also the premium amount per month paid.

Is there anything I should know about before applying for this policy? Can anyone help me understand if this is good?",Yes,Yes,No,No,No

10 years out, my boys are in there 20s and we're sitting on $80,000. It's a great start to a retirement account and it would be easy to have that in tax deferred IRA or a ROTH in their names as soon as they have some earned income.

But maybe one of them needs it for a house? Or to gamble on a startup? WHose name do we invest it in? It could be mine or theirs.

DO I have this right?  Following is my sketch of a plan for kids socsec.   


We are both retiring this year with pensions and my Social Security. We have two boys (11 &amp; 13)   
They will get about $16-$20K in dependant socsec benefits.   The money comes in their  names so it's effectively tax free. 

We have the next 7 years to make the most of this resource for them. 

My wife will work part time so there's the earned income.  I opened a Roth just for this so that starts the five year clock for withdrawal.   I could open a second Roth for my wife but we will not be able to withdraw until she's 59 1/2 except for education expenses,   so that might work. 

I could open 529 but i don't want to tie up too much  specifically for education.  Our retirement is all about the boys for the first 10 years.  We got a late start and we have to make up as much as we can.

That means their education expenses might include relocating to the city they go to school (probably within the state)  Or even moving overseas.   


So, out of $20K/yr I  can put $7000 in my Roth and start pulling it out tax free in five years for whatever i want.  I can put another $7000 in wifes Roth but withdrawal in five years is limited to legit education expense,   Do i have this right?

Should I put $1800 to fix the suspension and keep it or should I sell it for around 2K-2.5K?

we barely put 8K miles a year on it.

My husband will probably need extra car but the work is in walkable distance for now.

Now the actually money stay on your accounts since it move back and forth no need to actual move it just make sure the papers are therey

Once you die those money in you is you kids that you borrowed so they get there money back first before inheritance is divided out and taxed

mmtrrh,Sven_Bent,"Why Roth IRA/401k

I am making around 70k a yeas.  which puts me easily in the 24% tax bracket for the top of my income. ( my wife makes around the same so even as a couple we are both in this situation).

Now im just doing the math on my own income for illustration purpose

70.000 - 19.500 401k = 61.500

61.500 - 3.500  HSA =  58.000

58.000 with the standards 11.000 deductible is still going to place me in 48.000 taxable income with is still in the 24% bracket.

If i am getting this right that means my next 6k to an IRA  if it was an Roth i pay 24% tax off however if i go traditional i am not paying taxes until at pay out which most likely will be lower as my income will be lower at the time.

So Why is Roth recommend so much. Just for liquidity or am i missing a point here ?

plnf3k,Sven_Bent,"The hidden cost of 15year-mortgage

You will often hear people recommending a 15year mortgage over a 30yar because it cheaper. But that perspective often ignores opportunity cost and the fact you are utilization more resources to make it cheaper.

The alternative is to use a longer mortgage and use the same resources to grow faster than the debt and you will most often outperform financially on the 30year mortgage.

The results in most cases a 30year mortgage you can pay back faster and cheaper than a 15year mortgage

This is called opportunity cost. You lost out an opportunity on the extra monthly payments you are using on the 15year loan.

The premise is simply. You use the same amount of money every month as you would with your 15year mortgage but instead of it all going to the mortgage. with the 30y mortgage you use the different in monthly payments to invest.

Aka instead of $1200 going to mortgage on a 15 year mortgage, you do $800 to mortgage and $400 to retirement/investments.

This also have the benefits that in slim years you would be draining your EF slower as you are only responsible for a smaller monthly payment

I will be using two simply calculator for these examples

I will use investment growth with a 10% nominal growth which is appears to be the average looking over 10, 30 and even 50 years of the total stock market (aka for people using broad ""safe"" index investment strategies)

&amp;#x200B;

This is usually where people would say â€œSee the 30y mortgage is 50k more expensiveâ€ â€¦And yes it is, but it over 30years now let looks into what we can make in those 30 years.

The monthly difference is 1,334.68 - 822.51 = 512.17 you can invest monthly all 30 years in the 30year mortgage

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

In both cases we used the monthly payments of 1,334.68 over 30 years so the ""cost"" is the same in both situations for that we got 1 house and either 531,795.20 in our investments or 1,056,526.46 in our investments

Choosing the 15year mortgage highly reduce our financial situation

In the end we lost in the 15 year mortgage

1,056,526.46 - 531,795.20= 524,731.26

The 15year mortgage cost you half a million dollars in hidden opportunity cost. Or over twice the starting loan amount.

BUT I WANT TO THE FREEDOM OF NO MORTGAGE, some people might say.

OK, that is a perfect valid value to have. Itâ€™s going to cost you a little but in your future financial situation but even here 30year mortgage goes better. Letâ€™s look

&amp;#x200B;

After 15 years and finish paying the house, you will with a 30yar mortgage + investment end up with 65 thousand dollars more in your hand.

That is a pretty good start for the rest of your investment life

What does it do for 15 years of investing the mortgage payments?

&amp;#x200B;

Again, it easy to see the 30year mortgage comes out way ahead even if you goal is to pay of the house in 15 years

After 15 additional years of investing, you are behind 807,004.09 - 531,795.20 = 275208.89 in your financial. or the entire worth of your house.

&amp;#x200B;

Paying of the house in 15 years and then investing, you are behind 1,225,788.29 - 776,105.10 = 449683.19 at the 30-year mark

Half a million less

Bottom line is you need to consider the entire impact on your finances when doing a mortgage and not just the impact on the cost of the house.

if not, you might just cheat yourself from a lot of money

&amp;#x200B;

Investment are not a sure thing which is why averages was calculated. you might value a stable growth more than and unstable growth. My thumb of rules is  that stable growth is twice as good as unstable averages. so any  with and interest rate above  half the average in investments  could  be prioritized above investments

&amp;#x200B;

**TLDR: 15year loans with today low interest rates will in average hinder your finical growth tremendously and/or increase the time to pay of the mortgage**

&amp;#x200B;

Full disclosure: I did not take in gains taxes I was assuming 401k/IRA or something similar as investments vehicle.  Any gains taxes will limit the differences.

&amp;#x200B;

\---

**ON RISK**

it seems that alot of people are not understanding what averages are doing and claiming stock market risk was not calculated in the picture. 

It was. that is how averaging something does. it take bot the high and low and gives you an number of what it all sort outs to. it was clearly indicated tha the average used for the stock market was taken from look at the performance over  50, 30 and 10 years on the stock-markets. THIS INCLUDES THE RISK ON THE BAD YEARS

&amp;#x200B;

Now on loosing your jobs. let me reiterate.

if you have lost you income the worst thing you can do is have a high expense. with a 15y mortgage you have a higher expense so you are saddle tighter.  Your drain your EF faster you are running a higher risk of defaulting and being hit bit all the bad stuff that comes with that

on a 30y mortgage you can stop putting in funds in your investments decreasing your monthly expense directly, straddling you less  tight, Reducing the strain on your EF.

**30y mortgage makes it EASIER to ride out a bad time.**

and that is not calculating the fact that you have a big chunk of liquidity in your investments for easy access that is not only EASIER to acceas than the equity in your home. but also BIGGER.

I am 24

I am interested in retiring early, (aiming for late 30s, 40s if I have to).

I made $134,000 last year, though my base pay is somewhere around $65,000 per year. My employer offers large overtime incentives, which should be decreasing and I assume I'll make $100,000ish in 2023.

My goal is to max my 403b, 457b, Roth IRA, HSA plus a couple thousand extra into a brokerage account. 

Yes, rent is expensive but the way I see it owning a house is a lot of work. I don't have to deal with any sort of maintenance where I live now, I don't have a family and I am perfectly content with what I have.

A decent house would probably be in the $200-300K range where I live.

I keep a pretty low balance in my savings ($8500), have $33,000 in easily liquefiable assets, mostly my brokerage account. While selling would incur capital gains, I have losses from last year I can carry forward to offset them. And an additional $72000 between retirement accounts and my HSA.

plgayk,swaggy_butthole,"(US) Trying to plan for retirement (22), what is the best way to allocate my funds? I have a 403b, 457 b and roth IRA

I am 22, and I live in Kentucky. My base income is $58,500/year. I plan on working overtime throughout the year; my place of work offers significant overtime pay, often an extra 40$ an hour or so (on rare occasions can be up to 80$ hour on top of regular pay) where I usually make about $30 an hour.

I don't think it's important to spell out my expenses here; I live well within my means and limit spending wherever possible. My plan is to retire as early so I am planning for that now. I have roughly 4 months of expenses saved up as cash as well as liquefiable assets (crypto and stocks.) I have no loans or debts whatsoever.

So, as far as retirement goes I have the 403, 457b and roth IRA as my options. I also have an HSA. So balancing these funds in the most advantageous way possible is my goal here.

**What I've been doing**

My employer offers a 200% match for my 403b, up to 5% of my pay so that's a no brainer (I made a post before that mentioned this and people mentioned over and over how that's not possible, no one does a 200% match, etc. Yes, it is 200%, I am positive.)

On top of that, I've been putting $500/month into my Roth, $200/month into my 457b, and $200/month into my HSA (my employer also contributes $1000/year into my HSA).

**What I'm thinking about doing**

Employer matching is only available for the 403b, so that portion definitely needs to stay

I am thinking about completely striking the roth contribution from my retirement plan. From my research, the 457 and 403b seem to perform better. over time (assuming tax savings are re-invested.) 

Since I am taxed at about 31% (state, local and national). I might have done my math wrong there, so if anyone thinks it should be different let me know. but taking away the $500 a month from the roth would leave me with about $700 a month to invest. I think the best move is to try to max out my 457 if possible, it seems to be objectively superior to the 403b, especially since I plan on retiring earlier.

I dont expect any major health costs anytime soon, but there is the HSA I have to think about as well. I am thinking what I might do is add $500/month into my 457 and $250 a month into my HSA with the money left after taking out my roth contribution.

I have only been working for 3 months (pretty much fresh out of college) and haven't had a chance to work overtime yet. I would like to make enough to max out my 457 this year at which point I would probably contribute any extra savings into either my HSA or possibly my 403b

is the roth even worth touching? It sounds great if you're low income but I can't imagine my income bracket would be higher in retirement than it is now.


Also, Does anyone happen to know what happens If I accidentally contribute more than my yearly limit for my 403b/457b?",Yes,Yes,No,Yes,No

I am paid hourly, not by salary. I live in Kentucky, USA. I have no independents or major deductions.

I pulled some recent paychecks to look at how much my retirement contributions were affecting my taxes.

For reference, I make $26 an hour, roughly $31 with my shift differentials. Paychecks are bi-weekly

2 paychecks ago:

Total earnings: $2438.41. I have 404.67$ pre-tax deductions ($373.60 into HSA, 457b and 403 accounts; $31.07 for dental and health insurance)

withholding tax federal: $178.47 Medicare and social security: $170.38

Someone told me that federal tax rate does not include Medicare and social security and my federal taxes should be somewhere above 12% based on my extrapolated income of $63,388 from this pay period but it comes out to 11.4% including pre-tax deductions

My most recent paycheck I increased my retirement contribution by $200 a paycheck. I also only made $2163.95. Fed withholding tax is only 7.8% of my post deduction income.

I just stated working in June, so maybe it's because my income for the year is still low ($14,500 total for the year so far). So maybe that's why.

I have an HSA I max out yearly as well; I plan to pay for all health expenses with cash and save the receipts and use it as an adjunct retirement account down the road.

After all deductions, I get to keep around $760/2 weeks. This is just barely enough to cover living expenses. I work overtime if I want something like a vacation or a fun night out, but most of that extra money from overtime goes into my Roth IRA and other investments (other taxable accounts.)

My issue is rather complex, and I havenâ€™t been able to find anything dealing with my specific circumstances online. Iâ€™m planning to meet with an estate attorney, but thought Iâ€™d reach out to this sub to see what folks think.

Here we goâ€¦

In 2016 my dad died. He was a lifelong academic (professor) and had his retirement invested in TIAA. My mother handled his finances and was extremely risk-averse, so everything was placed in either an annuity or a money market account.

My mother died last year (2022). My sister and I are the named beneficiaries on the TIAA account.

My original desire was to roll over the TIAA into an Inherited IRA I set up with Fidelity.

However, TIAA now tells me that because I am a â€œ2nd Generationâ€ beneficiary (i.e., Dad â€”&gt; Mom â€”&gt; me) the IRS wonâ€™t allow me to roll over the account into an Inherited IRA. Instead, my choices are to either stay in the existing plan as a beneficiary or take a full lump sum payout (with all of the tax implications that entails).

Now, I donâ€™t necessarily think this guy is lying, but given that I canâ€™t find anything on the IRS sites relevant to the regulations he claims exist, Iâ€™m somewhat dubious.

Hey Guys,

A year ago I purchased /financed a ATV through Yamaha. The way they operate is they donâ€™t give you a traditional loan, they give you a line of credit (credit card) and then put the purchase amount onto the card. I can pay it off cash then sell and recoup the money but Iâ€™d rather not. My question is if I go about selling the bike before the credit card is paid what can happen? Could I immediately pay the remaining amount as soon as I sell it and be done with it or ?",,,,,

Hey Guys, 

My second oldest account on my credit is a personal loan I took out for a car a little over 2 years ago when I was 19. It has a 14% interest rate and a remaining balance of around 8k out of the original 11,700. I intend to refinance this since my credit score and overall credit file has dramatically improved. Iâ€™m sure I can shop around and get this in an actual auto loan with a much lower apr. My main question is should I apply for credit cards I intend on getting before refinancing and closing this account so my average age of credit doesnâ€™t drop and increase my chances of getting denied or lower initial limits.

Hey guys I have an idea but also open to other opinions. I was thinking of taking a cash advance on a credit card I have with a limit of 20k. Itâ€™s a process to get this done and also itâ€™s a transfer fee. So outside of a traditional cash advance direct deposit of atm/withdrawal any alternatives ?Here is my idea...


Cash App allows you to have multiple cards both debit and credit  and also bank accounts linked to it. If I use credit card on cash app to send letâ€™s say 5k to a CLOSE friend. Then get them to send the 5k back to me via cash app and I deposit that 5k from my cash app balance into my bank account I have pretty much moved 5k credit into 5k liquid without any fees.

Didnâ€™t get any responses on my last post, so Iâ€™ll try again. 


Hey all, I've been checking in on my retirement portfolio lately, and I have a few questions.  I'll list all my info first


33, married, first baby due in September


Currently maxing out my 401(k) and my Roth IRA, here's my combined portfolio between both accounts: (percentages are rounded)


25.5%  VTSAX (entire Roth IRA)

25%  FSPSX

16%  FXAIX

9.5%  FIDELITY CONTRAFUND (benchmark is S&amp;P 500, but only has 300 funds and different weighting. Also higher expense ratio)

7.5%  DFEVX

6%  MPC (a mistake, I know)

6%  FSMAX

3%  DODIX

.5%  VBMPX


Overall allocation:

63%  US Equity

32.5%  INTL Equity

3.5%  Bond/income


1)  I bought MPC through the employee stock purchase program in my 401(k) when everyone thought they were doing great.  Since then, the stock has done nothing but drop, and I am down about $4k from my total cost basis (25% of my MPC investment).  I still believe the stock will get back to where it was and beyond, but I don't know how long that will take.  When do you cut your losses on an investment?  I know I'm losing money on not being invested in something like FXAIX that is producing returns.  Should I hold or sell?

2)  Do I have redundant holdings?  Should I try to reduce down to 4-5 holdings or is it not that big of a deal?  Fees aren't really an issue.  My most expensive holding is DFEVX at .64% gross exp ratio.


3)  How should I use my money after I max out my 401(k)?  I put back 17% of my paycheck, and I will probably max out in October or November.  I can still get a 7% employer match through after-tax contributions.  I don't have much retirement savings outside of my 401(k) and Roth IRA.  Should I be saving money in a taxable account since I plan to retire when I'm 55?  How should I plan for the years between retirement and 59.5 years old when I can start withdrawing from my Roth IRA?",,,,,
fg3scc,Teddyworks,"Windfall advice, and also some retirement savings tax treatment

We could use some advice on our current situation. Weâ€™ll be having a windfall from the sale of a rental property soon. After paying off the mortgage, we should have about $25k leftover. Weâ€™re trying to figure out how to handle it. 
 
Me: 33
My wife: 28
First child due in September!!

**Income:**

Me: $120k minimum (hourly employee with plenty of overtime opportunities)
Wife: $60k

**Debt:**

$120k mortgage at 3.25%

**Savings and investments:**

$7k high-yield savings
$8k HSA (maxing out)
$120k 401(k) (maxing out)
$40k my Roth IRA (maxing out)
$8k her Roth IRA 
$4k Fidelity brokerage

**1.)** How should we use the $25k windfall?  We have considered paying it all as a principal payment on our current mortgage, or using it all to begin investing more in our brokerage account. Most likely would be in an index fund. I know I could probably have higher returns than 3.25% in the stock market, but it would also be a huge weight off our shoulders if we paid off the mortgage by the time Iâ€™m 40 too...

**2.)** We also plan to start maxing out her IRA. We have been thinking more about using a traditional IRA. Our AGI was $173k after our 2019 tax returns. It will lower a little bit next year after selling our rental property. If we used a traditional IRA, it might drop us down to the 22% bracket? I have always been confused on how to handle this situation, but I basically just split my savings 50/50 between pre-tax and after-tax. I can save Roth contributions in my 401k as well. 

**EDIT**: did some additional searches and found my answer. Looks like we cannot take a tax deduction on a traditional IRA with our high income. 

**3.)** I own a few individual stocks in my brokerage account, and plan to buy some more in the future. This is just more as a hobby than anything. But should I open an IRA with Fidelity to start buying those individual stocks in the tax-advantaged IRA?",,,,,
g5gjb4,Teddyworks,"Should I refinance?

We just bought our house in October of 2019, and weâ€™re already in a position to refinance! Crazy times we live in right now haha.

rxrbt1,Teddyworks,"Possibly purchasing farm ground in the future.. is it generally a good investment?

So we have a rather interesting family situation so itâ€™s a little tough to describe. Weâ€™re in the *VERY* early stages of this discussion, so Iâ€™m just trying to get a decent handle on things before more serious discussions and talking to lawyers and bankers. 

Essentially, my wife and I live on a 1 acre lot (we own) in the middle of a family owned (her family) farm land. We expected to have this land passed down to us (although I knew things might get complicated someday). 

Now, a family member that is the main executor (not sure thatâ€™s the right term) of the revocable trust wants to sell their portion of ownership in order to move away and stay close to their son in their retirement. 

So now we own our home in this cornfield and we are somewhat in a tough spot. Itâ€™s a lot of money. We would roughly be buying 70 acres of farmland. Itâ€™s already rented out to a farmer. Thereâ€™s also oil wells and we would have mineral rights, although I donâ€™t believe theyâ€™re major producers. Iâ€™m guessing a few bpd for each of the 4 wells. 

Letâ€™s presume that the cash rent and oil payments would cover 80% of the yearly mortgage and tax payments (since I have no idea of the specifics, only taking my best guess). So some money would be coming out of our pocket. We can afford this, although not saying itâ€™s ideal. 

Generally, I stick to the Boglehead approach, but it sure seems like a lot of people around here buy up land like itâ€™s the best investment. I guess what Iâ€™m asking.. what kind of things do I need to think about ahead of buying? Obviously I donâ€™t know much about land ownership. What are some benefits that Iâ€™m not seeing? (Tax deductions, tax write-offs,government programs..) what are some disadvantages or expenses that Iâ€™m not seeing?

tue4ba,Teddyworks,"35m/upper-middle income/married/1 child; Where do we go from here??

I've always been a financially inclined guy, and always loved saving/investing/planning, etc.  I've been realizing more and more that I kind of feel like we're plateaued.  We could easily just continue on as we have been and have a fantastic retirement and all those normal things.  We also feel like we are capable of more, and being a Boglehead.. it's very hard to feel like you're accomplishing much (even though you are).

&amp;#x200B;

So we're kind of looking for ideas.  I've really been thinking we need to meet with a CFP, which is on our outlook as well.  I'll give a quick rundown of our financials

&amp;#x200B;

**\*\*Income (combined) -\*\***

\- 2021 AGI $185k

**\*\*Debts -\*\***

\- Home - $108k 14 years left @ 2.25% (Appraised at $165k)

\- Minivan - $18k 3 years left @ 2.5%

**\*\*Savings -\*\***

\- HYSA - $35k (emergency &amp; large upcoming expense)

\- Brokerage - $50k (mostly S&amp;P500)

\- 401k - $250k (Pre-tax)(max-out every year)

\- Roth IRA - $95k (both accounts combined/ max both out every year)

&amp;#x200B;

So we had saved up to remodel our kitchen which is why we have such a large savings.  Well we got to that point and we really weren't inclined to follow through.  Then we got word of a future opportunity to buy a large amount of income producing farm-ground from family (roughly 80 acres @ $6k-$10k/acre).  So we've kind of held on to this money to see how that situation turns out.

&amp;#x200B;

We're now kind of at an impasse.  The farm-ground purchase could go either way, and still might be a few years out before its available.  We've considered real estate, but our schedules are so hectic, that I'm not sure it's viable for our happiness/marriage quality (we both work shift work).  Rentals are promising if they're quality properties that wouldn't need much renovating/maintenance.  We're in a small town in Southern IL, so higher rent prices can be a tough sell.

&amp;#x200B;

We've kind of held off on paying down our debt because the rates are so dang low, and we feel we have a pretty safe cushion should something happen.

&amp;#x200B;

Perhaps I just need to vent, but surely I'm not the only one to have this struggle between wanting to do more investing yet not having a whole lot of time to give.",,,,,

Anyways, Iâ€™m trying to figure out what my first step should be in getting myself out of this deep pit of debt Iâ€™ve dug myself in to... I should honestly find a new job, but everywhere Iâ€™ve checked out nearby has such a toxic environment and where I currently work has a great work environment and I donâ€™t want to lose that even though eventually itâ€™ll happen. 

Appreciate you taking the time to listen to my rant and I hope someone is able to help me take the steps to start becoming financially sound. 

FYI I was a stupid teen and even more dumb in my early 20s and now itâ€™s haunting me... ðŸ˜¬",,,,,

p4mng2,TheRealMulli,"401(k) questionâ€¦

The company I work for matches 50% up to 6% of pre-tax income so with that and reading around the webs about contributing 15%-20% of your gross income and since I get paid weekly, how much should I invest per paycheck? I put down 10% per paycheck and I get paid about $420 per week so thatâ€™s $42 a week into my 401(k). Am I doing too much or is this fine? 

I was going to follow the 50/30/20 rule and since 20% goes to savings I figured Iâ€™d take 10% weekly and put into my companyâ€™s 401(k) and the other 10% will go into my personal savings.

But could yâ€™all let me know if this is a good plan atm

So as I said I bring home about $420/week and if I break that down via the 50/30/20 rule, that gives me $210/week for needs, $126/week for wants and $84/week for savings. 

Needs are around $550/month, Wants run about $50/month and then after the 10% contribution into my works 401(k) Iâ€™d have $42 left per week to throw into personal savings. 

Is this a good starting point or should I change anything?",,,,,

wh581q,TheRealMulli,"50/30/20 Budgeting rule, trying to figure this out with my income

So Iâ€™m starting to budget and trying to get a hold on my money and am currently looking at going with the 50/30/20 Rule. My question is since I mostly see that 401(k) is counted along with the 20% savings, how should I go along breaking down my weekly check via this rule?

For my 401(k) I do 6% cuz my employer matches up to 50% of the first 6%

So to break it down imma low ball on how much I usually bring home per week:

$400/wk (itâ€™s usually more than this by maybe $20-$40, but to be on the safe side Iâ€™ll say only $400)

Now Iâ€™ve got two bank accounts, one at Ally and the other at Capital One. Ally is for bills and emergency fund since they have the savings buckets so each paycheck Iâ€™ve got 70% going into my Ally Checking which then I split up into needs and savings. The remaining 30% of my paycheck goes to Capital One for my Daily Checkingâ€™s for you guessed it wants and daily stuff. 

My question is, since the 401(k) is taken into consideration for the 20% savings and Iâ€™m only putting in 6% into that, that means Iâ€™ve got 14% left to budget into an emergency fund savings so with that 70% Iâ€™m putting into my Ally account, should I divvy it up as 56% into my Bills and then that 14% into emergency fund or just keep it as is 50% still into Needs and 20% still into Savings?

Hey everyone! Iâ€™m a 24 year old guy living with my parents. 

I just graduated college in December after 5.5 years. 

From 2016 through the summer of 2019 I built what got to be a large, fast growing, and successful business until I closed it in August last summer. 

Over the course of almost four years I worked with hundreds of clients and built a name for myself until it all came crashing down. 

I had only paid myself $1,000 a month as a salary and mistakenly reinvested every penny back in the business without any kind of cushion or saving anything for myself. 

The failed business left me heavily, heavily in debt at 23 years old. $68k to be exact 

Iâ€™m an entrepreneur to my core. At 24 Iâ€™ve never had a â€œreal jobâ€ working for anyone but myself. 

Iâ€™ve been working on launching a new business, but the shame, anxiety, and fear has lead to mental paralysis. 

Itâ€™s just this big secret Iâ€™m keeping.

While I am paying them $500 a month for rent, My parents have no clue. They arenâ€™t very supportive of me being an entrepreneur as it is and we are on shaky ground relationship wise because of it. They make good money but they couldnâ€™t help even if they wanted to.

I got myself into this mess and somehow some way will get out of it myself. 

Throughout last fall and early this year Iâ€™ve went to each creditor one by one and explained my situation. Theyâ€™ve all been very understanding. 

The payment plans Iâ€™m on with each creditor are manageable and very, very long term (two creditors make up 75% of what I owe and both have me on 4 year payment plans), but just the thought of having that much debt for such a long time is causing me so much anxiety. 

None of the debt is on my credit report. My score is 680. 

The one thing that scares me to death is the UCC lien Kabbage filed for the the loan I took toward the end of the business.

I guess my question is how do you remain productive and at peace mentally while in debt? How do you pace yourself? 

Iâ€™m a big thinker and am not the most patient person. The thought of it potentially taking 4 years to be debt free alone leaves me paralyzed mentally if that makes sense. 

I just keep pushing myself to find a way to make more money faster. Itâ€™s put me in this never ending spiral of churning through business ideas and chasing money.",,,,,

Iâ€™m curious the best way to profit off a company thatâ€™s about to go bankrupt in the near future (6 months to a year) with options?

Itâ€™s strictly a bad balance sheet play. Right now this company canâ€™t make the interest payments on their debt and has no working capital. 

They have no tangible assets as well. 

In the next few months they will breach their bond covenant

i5h02m,thesonofnarcs,"Why you have to look beyond the balance sheet: A Cautionary Tale

For almost 7 years I was a dyed in the wool value investor. I did very well. 

As I would look back on stocks I passed on investing over the years I saw many of them went to zero or close to it. 

So, I got the bright idea of using LEAP put options on companies I would never go long on. 

I started in the casino, hotel, and resort space. I spent two weeks one by one researching and then ranking each company based from strongest to weakest on all the metrics and benchmarks Graham talks about in the Intelligent Investor (interest coverage, what their bonds yielded, working capital, credit rating, etc.)

My goal was to find the absolute weakest company in the sector/industry. A company with an atrocious balance sheet that was barely surviving. 

In my mind I thought it would be the perfect one to bet against. 

I found it. It was Penn National Gaming (PENN). They ranked number one as the weakest company. They have billions in debt, negative working capital, negative tangible book value, and not enough money before tax to cover the interest payment.

They have had to continually issue new shares and dilute their stock. Their current shares outstanding are 200% higher than they were 4 years ago. 

PENN reached a low of $3.50 during the March crash. When I finished my research it was at $28.

My thesis was that with the company being in such horrible financial shape and their casinos being closed for so long would take the stock back down and potentially make the company file Chapter 11. 

Even if their casinos reopened I did not think that they could survive on a fraction of their former traffic. 

With all that in mind it seemed like it was possible for the stock to go back to what it was in March. 

I had such conviction I invested $1,000 in puts with a $3 strike that expire in January.

I made one big mistake. I didnâ€™t know about Dave Portnoy when I initiated my position. I didnâ€™t think Barstool could generate enough revenue to save them. 

Dave Portnoy is the equivalent of Elon Musk in the sports world. Just like Elonâ€™s tweets move Tesla Portnoy has been able to move PENN.

I donâ€™t blame him. I just made the mistake of overestimating the influence one person can have on a stock. 

Today the stock is worth $49. I bought my puts when stock was at $28. 

Iâ€™m down 70%. The money I lost does sting, but it doesnâ€™t bother me. 

I went in knowing I could lose it all or make 42X my money. I saw it as an asymmetric bet. 

But, at 24 years old this lesson will stick with me the rest of my investing career.

I owe PayPal $40,000 from a failed business two years ago when I was 23

In the spring of 2020 after not hearing from them for almost 7 months I emailed the executive team/CEO and told them my story. 

I asked for a payment plan. 

Some high level executive had the COO of the debt collection agency they contract with (meaning they didnâ€™t sell the balance) call me personally and oversee my account. 

He was managing my account personally (meaning the main agency wasnâ€™t calling and it wasnâ€™t in their teams system). He knew my story and basically just said to pay when I can and what I can and that PayPal would be monitoring my payments.

I paid off $4,000 of it in a year. 

Today I called to make a payment and was told that the account was removed from the agency and to call PayPal. 

My hope was that it was sent to another agency that I could set up a new payment plan with.

I called PayPal and was told it was back in house with them. 

I guess I wasnâ€™t paying fast enough?

The problem is they donâ€™t and wonâ€™t accept or set up Payment plans because itâ€™s not a line of credit and thereâ€™s no interest (itâ€™s just a negative balance).

They said that I can call and make partial payments as often as I want but thereâ€™s nothing to setup. 

The lady in the collections department also didnâ€™t know how long theyâ€™ll keep it in house.

They also wonâ€™t settle. The collection agency was willing to knock $10,000 off.

Iâ€™m a little freaked out by all the ambiguity from PayPal. I had a smaller balance with them in another account (that Iâ€™ve since paid off) from the same business and they called my parents house at all hours. 

I made it clear that I only wanted them to call my cell phone only. She said that wouldnâ€™t be a problem but it doesnâ€™t give me much comfort.

I negotiated the APR before buying the car. I don't remember the exact rates, but the dealership was giving me 8% through Wells Fargo and I was pre-approved for 6% through Capital One. I originally intended to put down $1000 and my financing was based on that figure. 

My mistake was that I got the 6% APR by putting down $2000 versus 8% APR by putting down $1000. 

The dealership emailed me on Wednesday asking me to sign a new contract with the updated APR. I'm scared because I don't remember what I signed first and I don't know if this is going to come back to bite me.

Hello! Quick question for you all.

I have a 2016 Honda Civic, which I love. I got it when I was in college and it's treated me very well. It's been on a lot of road trips with me and as a result it's got about 160,000 miles on the odometer. Despite the high miles, it still runs well, and the only expenses I've incurred with it are routine upkeep (tires, brakes, fluids, etc.). And the body is still in beautiful shape.

My question is this -- does it make more financial sense to trade in periodically, or should I run my Honda until the wheels fall off? A local dealership estimates I could get around $12,000-$15,000 for it given the current state of the car market, and I could afford to level up to a newer Civic or Accord with lower miles. On the other hand, I could probably continue to drive this car for another five years (or more), though the trade-in value by then will probably be next to nothing.

So, which scenario makes more financial sense? Trade in and bank a good chunk of money to put toward a newer model with fewer miles, or run the car until it dies, at which time I'll have to buy a new car without the benefit of being able to trade in my Civic for the cost of half the new car?

ryvmez,throwaway_4829890973,"My car was totaled and now I'm (unfortunately) in the market for a new one. Should I buy used or new, and should I finance or pay in full?

Hi!

Earlier this week, I allowed my mom to borrow my car. As it turns out, this was a big mistake. On her way home, she got into an accident and totaled the car (she was fine, thankfully). My car was a 2016 Honda Civic -- cheap to maintain, reliable, and fully paid off. Needless to say, I was really hoping not to have a car payment for the foreseeable future -- especially given the fact that I recently graduated from college and wanted to put all the money I possibly could toward a downpayment on a home and invest the rest.

But, unfortunately, I am now in the market for another car. My insurance payout will help, but my car had high miles, and therefore there's still going to be at least a $10,000 gap between the value of my old Civic and the value of a newer model (I will probably buy a Honda Insight, which is essentially a hybrid version of the Civic). Obviously, this is a terrible time to be in the market for a car, as prices have inflated at least 35% on used cars.

So, given this less-than-ideal situation, what is the most financially responsible thing to do? I can either pay for a new Honda that will likely last a decade or more, or I can pay slightly less for a used Honda that may not have been maintained properly by the previous owner and may not last as long due to previous use. Also, I can afford to pay for the car in full, but I think it may be more financially prudent to secure a low APR loan and invest the money I would otherwise be spending to pay the car off in full.

Advice would be greatly appreciated. Thank you all so much.

EDIT: I can get a 2022 Honda Insight for $26,500 or a used model for a couple thousand dollars less. Even the equivalent of what I had (2016 Honda Civic) would be around $20,000 for a model with under 50,000 miles. Really an awful time to be in the market for a car.",,,,,

Hi, everyone!

Unfortunately, my car was recently totaled by another driver, and I am now in need of another car for everyday use. However, I will likely be leaving the country for an extended period in four months, which complicates this situation. I can either buy a used car (Honda) at an inflated price, considering the current state of the used car market, or I can opt for something a bit more unconventional: I could buy a new Honda Accord, use it for a few months, and then sell it back (either to a dealership or on the private market) when it comes time to leave.

Considering the current value of used cars (which I don't imagine will go down much in only a few months), I think this may be a decent way for me to give myself a means of transportation while recouping most of my money down the road.

My 2016 Honda Civic (160,000 miles) was totaled by another driver recently, so I am unfortunately in the market for another car. I am anticipating a \~$15,000 payout from the insurance company -- which would be enough to get me into another high-mileage Civic, but I'm not sure it would be wise to pay for a used car that has 160,000 miles already. 

**So, I am left in a bind. As you are probably aware, used car prices have increased 35% over the last year. That in mind, I have found several 2016-2018 Honda Accords with \~50,000-70,000 miles for between $23,000 and $26,000 OTD, while a new Accord with zero miles would cost me closer to $30,000 OTD.** 

The same is true of Civics: used Civics with \~75,000 miles are often selling for only slightly less (and sometimes more!) than \*new\* Civics, so I would be in the same situation if I decided to buy another Civic (but I would prefer an Accord).

I am also factoring anticipated depreciation into my calculus. As the used car market begins to cool down over the next year or two, I would expect a used Accord priced at $24,000 now to lose a third of its value or more, which is a huge waste of money and probably even worse in terms of depreciation than a new Accord.

I know buying new is typically frowned upon in this sub, but considering the state of the used car market right now, which do you think is the better choice?",,,,,

I am currently working on an H1b. If I lose my job, I have to leave the country in 2 or 3 months. I don't remember the exact details.

I have about 400K in Index funds and 100K in my 401K account. I make around 230K(Base + Bonus + stocks). I have 5 years of experience as a software engineer.

I am currently leasing a studio apartment in Jersey City, NJ. For 1700$ a month. I am 30 and I am single. I don't have any plans of getting married. I would want to return back to India before I turn 40.

Under these circumstances is it advisable to buy a studio apartment in NYC manhattan? For 5 to 10 years?",,,,,
soo01i,throwback656,"I am trying to debate if I should see my old dentist vs a new one closer to my home.

I used to see a dentist close to my office for a dental cleaning and stuff. He took an X-Ray of my whole mouth barely 6 months ago. Now I switched jobs and I found a new dentist closer to my home and she has great reviews on Google/Yelp.

My new insurance only allows a full mouth X-Ray once in 3 years. And since I have new insurance she wants to do a brand new X-Ray of my whole mouth again. I got a copy of my X-Rays which at this point is barely 6 months old and she is refusing to use those :| She wants to do an X-Ray again. This is just a routine dental checkup/cleaning that I get every 6 months.

I have two concerns at this point. (1) If I do have to get an X-Ray maybe next year for an actual problem, I would have to pay for it out of pocket. (2) I don't want to get an X-Ray for no justifiable reason. X-rays are radiation. Just because it is free, I am not going to bombard my mouth with radiation, because this dentist can bill my insurance company an extra 100$.

On the whole, to me, it feels like the dentist is just being greedy. I called her and asked her why she wants to get another X-Ray and she is like because it is free. I want to get my own X-Ray done.

Should I just stick with my old dentist even though he lives far away from me? What will happen if I just go to this Dentist and refuse to get an X-Ray?

t2epax,throwback656,"Are there any consequences for over-pay taxes to the IRS? Will I get audited?

I spent the whole of today going through my transactions trying to   
(1) Make sure my Qualified dividends are actually Qualified Dividends. (I switched from Robinhood to Schwab last year).  
(2) My Section 199A dividends satisfy the holding period.  
(3) Find the cost basis for the small portion of the gold that the gold ETF I held(IAU) sold last year to cover its expenses. (15 cents)

At this point, I am really vexed with this whole process. According to Turbotax, I will probably get 200$ back if my qualified dividends are actually qualified dividends. And the gold ETF sold 15 cents worth of gold last year.  


Can I just mark all of my qualified dividends as ordinary dividends and the 15 cents that IAU sold last year as income?  


I don't want to do so much work for 200$.  Will I get audited for doing these kinds of things?",,,,,
