uj8wq3,NinoZachetti,"Game plan to help pay for kids' college

Background:  I'm an early 50s divorced male with two kids that will both be off to university late this summer.  There are no savings specifically earmarked for our kids' education and all of our assets were divided equally in our divorce a few years ago.  Here's my current financial scenario:

*I own a home worth $2 million with about $285k left on my 3.125% 30-year mortgage.  My monthly mortage payments are about $1,300/month.

*I have about $180k in my Schwab retirement account allocated mostly to target date 2035 index funds (SWYFX).

*I own my car and have no other debt other than normal monthly expenses.

*After paying taxes last month I have about $20k remaining in cash in a bank money market account that is there to cover monthly expenses and serve as an emergency fund.

*I started my own LLC a year ago and make around $100k per year.  My first client is having significant supply issues so my contract with them is extremely unstable right now.  I updated my resume today and am going to begin looking for new client(s) immediately.

*I realize that I am not well-positioned for a normal retirement horizon right now and that I'll likely have to sell my home at some point to be able to do that.  I live in a metro area where real estate is absolutely insane, so I view my home equity as my eventual retirement, not the modest about I have in my IRAs.  I live well within my means, haven't been on a real vacation in many years, drive a 2011 Chevy with low miles, shop frugally, dine out rarely, etc.  I am very happy with what I currently have and my home is my happy place.

My ex and I have met with the financial teams at each of the universities that our boys will be attending.  Both will be taking the maximum federal student loan amounts of $5,500 and we have enough GET units to mostly cover each of their first semesters.  My parents are going to be kicking in $2k each which I will deposit into bank accounts that I will establish for each boy and will use this money for payments to the schools.  Beyond that it looks like there is a gap of approximately $5,000/month over the college months total between the two, so we're going to have to come up with a game plan to close this gap.

Assuming a 50/50 split of this burden between my ex and me, and also assuming that I accept this burden, that's $2,500/month that I will be on the hook for, and I don't have that kind of pad in my earnings.  The Parent Plus loan is one option, and I've also begun brainstorming others such as a private loan, line of credit, or HELOC.  Given the interest rate on my mortgage compared to current market I'm guessing that a cash-out re-fi isn't going to be an attractive option for me.  Though we likely won't be having to make any significant payments until the first of next year (as a result of our GET units), I'm motivated to begin making decisions on this now as a result of my LLC client being very unstable.  If a worst-case scenario happens and my client doesn't renew my contract with me and I have difficulty finding a new client I don't want any lending institution refusing my loan request as a result.

So I'm trying to decide what to do here and am experiencing a lot of anxiety about this.  I knew college was going to be expensive but I didn't anticipate this much of gap between their federal student loans  and overall total cost.  I would be very appreciative of any advice given to me for the best game plan to move forward.

p5nlca,No7onelikeyou,"New to investing! Roth IRA vs Taxable account question

Hello! I donâ€™t know everything, not even close, so please excuse me if this is an â€œeasyâ€ question to answer. 

When it comes to investing long term, most think maxing out a Roth IRA is fantastic, due to the tax benefits, especially when someone is a little older and can take it out completely tax free (59 and a half years old). 

Due to the annual contribution limit, is it designed to be that way? As far as the big compound interest not really taking effect until years and years. Why is there a limit anyway? They donâ€™t want someone having too much? I mean isnâ€™t a $6k limit per year small? Once someone is 50 then it goes to $7k, but I mean thatâ€™s at 50 years old.

Anyway, I was then looking up info on a taxable brokerage account, from my understanding, there is NO contribution limit. Talk about a night and day difference! Despite the taxes. 

Since time is HUGE when it comes to investing, isnâ€™t it best to put in as much as possible, with as much time left as possible? 

For these two examples, $180,000 is the total. I used a compound interest calculator at investor.org. 

$0 initially. $500/monthly for 30 years at 8%. Just over $679,000 is the total after all that time. Thatâ€™s for $6,000/year

Compared to $180,000 at once. As well as $0/month, for 30 years at 8% as well, the total comes out to be over a million dollars more lol

So despite the taxes, would it be best to put in as much as possible into a taxable account due to the compound interest and time? Where as even with taxes, the amount â€œtake homeâ€ would still be higher? 

If someone can invest $15,000/year...instead of $6,000/year in to the Roth and $9,000 into a taxable, wouldnâ€™t they be better off putting in all $15,000 in to the taxable? Not as beneficial tax wise, but how do you factor in the amount being much higher since so much is being put in, with the compound interest going crazy even early on, especially then with so much time left? 

A Roth IRA sounds great, but is someone better off putting in more elsewhere, thanks to it being a higher total amount compared to dividing up among accounts?

(C) Two family home for $800k-900k. = ~$4300 monthly mortgage payment.

o9u5rn,NoGimmicks,"My parents have a severely underfunded retirement account but own and live in an income producing property. What's the best plan for retirement?

My parents have less than $20k in retirement accounts and ~$25k in savings. They took out a $30k loan from family to pay off the house a couple of months ago. Based on their previous mortgage payments, property/rental taxes, I calculate they will now be netting $20k a year from the rental income. 

My dad has always worked physical jobs and has recently been having knee and back issues. He is ready to retire yesterday, but his goal is to hang in there 2 more years. I am thinking he should use those two years of full-time work to open and max out Roth IRAs for himself and my mom. If all goes according to plan in two years the $30k loan will be paid off while maxing out the Roths. After that he can transition to a part-time job or a full-time job that is less demanding so he can continue to max out the Roth IRAs and the rental income will pay for regular bills.

Five years from now he will be 60 and my mom 63 and they will have a paid off house, $70k in their Roths (+ growth hopefully) and my two younger siblings that live with them now should be starting their own careers be able to survive on their own by then.

They can then sell the house which is currently valued at $1.28 million on zillow and the owner of the house next door offered $900k 3 years ago without even stepping inside. Barring a huge market crash in the next 5 years they may be able to sell for $1mill and buy a single family home in a lower cost of living area for under $300k. After closing costs, fees, taxes, etc I'm hoping they have at least $550k leftover. 

**What kind of tax implications are there if they took that $550k and stuck it in a taxable brokerage account all at once and began to withdraw from it annually for retirement ?**

If they have $600k at retirement (taxable account + roth + tiny 401k) and follow the 4% rule they will have $24k a year to live off of to start. I think they can manage with a paid off home and no other debt. There will also be some sort of social security coming in and with three children we can help fill in the gaps if we have to.

Any suggestions or criticisms of the plan are highly appreciated!

Edit: The house is over 100 years old and they have been lucky that there really has only been one major issues in the 21 years of ownership. I feel like its only a matter of time before something expensive needs fixing.

re8fei,NoGimmicks,"I'm worried my new student loan provider will increase my monthly payments based on my new income. How can I keep my payments low?

**TL;DR** at the bottom  

I currently owe $18,200 in student loans. No car payments, mortgage, or credit card debt. I have ~$4000 set aside for student loans and contribute $300 weekly to that account, so in one years time I should have $19,000+ and be able to pay off the loans in full.

The reason I'd rather pay it all off at the end of year rather than making large monthly payments throughout the year is that my emergency fund is very depleted and I would feel more secure having access to cash from the student loan account until I can rebuild my emergency fund. I also would prefer to max out my Roth contributions earlier in the year.

When I originally did my income based loan repayment questionnaire I had just started working full-time in my field and was not making a lot of money. Since then I've had a $30K salary increase and my expenses are lower since my fiancÃ©e and I live together now.

My discretionary income will also appear higher because I took on a part-time job in July of this year. That income is strictly to pay for the wedding, but I doubt that is something I can specify to the loan service provider.

**With payments starting up again I am worried that if I select an income based repayment option my monthly payments will substantially increase. What would be the best repayment plan to keep monthly payments low?**    

***Side Note:***  

My emergency fund is usually in a healthy state but this year I heavily tapped into it as I started off the year unemployed, bought an engagement ring, opened up a Roth IRA for the first time and maxed out 2020 and 2021 contributions. I should be able to restore it back up to normal in the next 7-8 months.

**TL;DR:** I've had a significant salary increase and am afraid a income-based repayment plan will result in a high monthly payment.

rlml8n,NoGimmicks,"Buying a house in two years, should I be concerned about the effect of paying off my student loans early, number of new credit cards, and having two new jobs?

Sorry in advance for the long post!

As of today my credit scores are 797 from Transunion, 781 from Experian, and 794 from FICO. 

My oldest account is 13 years and my average account age is 3.7 years.

My credit report shows 5 recently opened accounts on my reports. I opened 3 credit cards in 2021 and 1 account in 2020. My fiancÃ©e opened  an account in 2020 on which I am an authorized user so it shows up on my report as well.

On Experian when I opened three credit cards this year within 3 months of each other my credit score went from 794 to 733. Its since made its way back to 781. FICO and TransUnion took dips too but don't have those number available. They are back in the high 790s now.

I have a total of 12 total accounts which includes two student loans that have opening dates of Sept and Feb 2017. My plan is to pay them both off early. December 2022 is the goal.

**I am concerned that because my average account age is only 3.7 years if I pay off my student loans and those two accounts are closed than my credit score will drop significantly. Will ~1-1.5 years time be enough for it bounce back? And/or will the improvement to my DTI outweigh the potential drop in credit score?**

Ideally I also want to open one more card in January 2022. This would be the last card I ""need"" to maximize my cashback. I'm a person that spends less with credit cards than cash and once I call and downgrade my CSP card after the first year, none of my cards have annual fees. If the lookback period for ""recently opened cards"" is two years than this last card should fall off by January 2024. 

I am getting married in May 2022 so I took on a part-time job to cashflow wedding/honeymoon costs. I am unsure if I want to continue with the job after the wedding and I'm not sure if it may hurt my mortgage application. My part-time job was my full time job from August 2017-October 2020 (although my first year was at 1 location and then years 2-3 was at another location with separate payroll). I left in October in 2020 and returned in July 2021 as part-time.

**I've read that banks want to see 2 year of employment, if I took a break from the part-time job after the wedding would it hurt me if I haven't reached two consecutive years of employment by the time my wife and I are applying for a home loan in 2024? Does the fact that its my part-time job and not full-time make this question moot?**

I started my full-time job in March 2021 after being unemployed from October 2020-February 2021 and anticipate remaining with my current employer until mortgage time.

Regarding my DTI, its currently at 9% when only factoring in my full-time salary and no student loan payments. When payments restart it'll be ~13%. With the part-time job factored in then my DTI improves.

Once I'm married and the student loan is paid off our combined DTI would be ~8% or better depending on if I'm working part-time or either of us gets raises.

BTW I hope I'm calculating DTI correctly. As I understood it the only debt I have is rent + student loans. Don't have any car or personal loans and all credit cards are current.

My mother in law is at a crossroads. She got out of a bad situation where her husband unexpectedly died without insurance, leaving her in a huge house with hundreds of thousands of dollars of debt, including $50k on credit cards, a new car loan, and liens on the home. Sheâ€™s 70 and collecting social security, but also working, making ~$45,000 a year.

She got out of that mess, sold the house, used the equity to pay down debt, and eliminate the liens, paid off half of her car, and rented a home by paying for a year in advance. The year is almost up and she has to decide: rent or buy?

Her monthly from SS is $2,500. She has $10k remaining on the card, but is floating that to keep her liquid assets until she makes this decision. She has $80,000 in the bank. Her rent is too much ($2,000), but she wants to buy a home thatâ€™s $300,000 (I canâ€™t convince her to look at houses for less) and use $60k down to lower the payment and avoid PMI.

I like the idea of her buying simply because if she runs out of money she will have the equity rather than some landlord, but thereâ€™s something to be said about not eliminating that lump sum of liquidity. Renting for a number of years will probably never put her in the position to own again, but she will have emergency money. Sheâ€™s in fine health, but sheâ€™s 70.

What happens if one super athlete is recruited to the pros straight from high school and doesnâ€™t attend college? What if I save more than the cost of their choice community college?

Are there any reasons to go for one over the other that I should think about? And for an IRA, can it be in the childâ€™s name instead of limiting my own annual contributions?","Loss Aversion, Regret Aversion, Sunk Cost Fallacy","The statement reveals several biases. The concern about restrictions on using 529 plans and the potential for the children to not utilize the funds due to a ""free ride"" or early athletic career suggests Loss Aversion, as the individual is worried about losing the value of their investment. Regret Aversion is also present, as the individual is considering alternative options (IRA) to mitigate potential regret if their current choice (529 plans) doesn't work out. Additionally, the mention of having already invested in 529 plans since birth and the concern about saving more than the cost of community college indicates a Sunk Cost Fallacy, as the individual is hesitant to abandon or adjust their existing investment due to the resources already committed.","The user exhibits a cautious and risk-averse approach to financial planning, driven by a desire to minimize potential losses and regret, while also being influenced by past investments."

icn5ky,NoHinAmherst,"Considering a refinance/HELOC, but what pitfalls?

Iâ€™m looking at interest rates, letters Iâ€™m getting with offers, and weighing my options. The impetus behind this consideration is my driveway needs to be replaced (quote: $9,000), one A/C is rusting out but still running (quote: $7,000), we have a sinkhole from builder debris thatâ€™s 5 feet deep in our backyard (I did confirm itâ€™s not water/natural, but quotes for this range on what weâ€™d want to do, minimum $5,000) and while Iâ€™d like to put ALL of this off another 10 years, it seems money is â€œcheapâ€ right now. And of course, the wife wants a new kitchen (quote: infinity...ignore this portion).

Iâ€™m looking for feedback about what things to look out for when asking around, what tricks I should avoid if I consider a refi or second mortgage or HELOC.

Some info: 
- My mortgage rate is currently 3.5%. I have 26 years remaining, though I had been paying it as a 15 year.
- We plan to live here forever, though thatâ€™s dependent upon work.
- My credit is 806-849 depending on the agency.
- My mortgage owed is about $300,000 on a $409,000 mortgage and the home value average estimate is around $460,000.
- No debt other than the mortgage and my car payment of $360 which ends in two weeks!
- Liquid capital: $70,000 (7 month safety net).

I could just as easily leave all of these repairs and improvements until the wheels fall off, Iâ€™m not itching. I just donâ€™t want to miss an opportunity to make these repairs when my credit is high and rates are low, when it could cost me a lot more at a later date.

Ideally, Iâ€™d like to get the magical scenario where my payment is the same or close to what it is now, due to a lower rate, but also put equity to use to fix and update the home.

mmwnsu,NoHinAmherst,"How to bring my credit back up

Georgia, USA

I had a score of 849 for a while and used that to refinance my house in October/November. 

With that score the following was and remains true: credit cards paid off completely every month, no car loan, no debt, no student loans, always paid on time for 20+ years, oldest account is 15+ years, only two credit cards*, no dings of any sort.

The only thing I changed was I took advantage of a Delta skymiles card to get 75,000 miles in late December. I signed up, put the $2500 necessary to earn my reward, paid it off, and stopped using it (didnâ€™t cancel). My credit dropped to 784 with the new hard inquiry and line of credit. No big deal, still prime, but I hope to have it go back up so itâ€™s not a single incident away from being sub-760 (prime). 

4 months later and Iâ€™m up to 795 but not moving. Is there something else I should be doing? Iâ€™d like to cancel this new card after the award clawback period next year and I know that will lower my score temporarily, which is why I want to get back up.

ok73h1,NoHinAmherst,"Looking for a solution to a stupid problem I created with the IRS

This tax year was different for my family, as it was for many others. I typically owe money at the end of the year, but due to a loss of income during the pandemic from my wife who is a real estate agent (1099-NEC) and suddenly had to spend much more time working out of the house with our two kids, we were owed a refund. My refund was something like $5,606 and, as it turns out, this matters.

I filed early, around Feb or March, and my return was accepted. I file with multiple states, so I always check my bank accounts to make sure that the refunds come in and just as importantly, the checks owed to another state were cashed by that state. Within two weeks, I saw a direct deposit of $5,606 and that my MA check was deposited. Great! But then a couple weeks later I noticed that the IRS deposited $3,727.94 a day or two after my refund AND another deposit of $1,873.06 around a week later.

What were these two amounts? My taxes were complete, and these random totals were confusing. Refunds should be rounded to a dollar amount anyway, so why the $0.06 or $0.94? Those add up to a dollar! Wait, those two checks add up to $5,600 when combined. Did the IRS just pay me twice? Am I about to get a third check for $6?

A Google search told me that sometimes the IRS might make a double payment by mistake, and if that's the case, you better not keep it. They may take a long time to notice, but when they do, you'll owe it WITH INTEREST AND FEES. No thanks; I did my taxes, I filed on time, and I'm not going to find out next year that I owe the IRS this money back, plus more, because of their mistake.

First, I called my bank and asked if the IRS could or would just pull the money back and was told that's impossible. Then I called the IRS (imagine the amount of time on hold) and spoke to someone in the refund department who could not confirm that I'd been paid twice. We also wondered about the missing $6. Why was the double payment in two checks? Why did those add up to $5,600? Why not $5,606? In the end, she suggested that I call my bank and have them reject those two checks, assuming another $6 check would arrive in the future -- at least it wouldn't cost me much of anything in interest when it arrived. So I did.

Is anyone reading this in a family of four, with two dependents, earning an AGI under the limit to qualify for the stimulus, yelling at me for what I did? That's right, I returned my $1,400 per person stimulus check, for joint filers with two children. I still have no idea why they broke it into two random-sized checks and don't know when or how or if the backlogged IRS will send the money back.

I currently rent for $1350 a month in my current city, and was planning to buy a house in the new city. I looked at a few places, didn't love anything so never ended up making any offers, and figured I'd at least rent for a bit and get a feel for the new city a bit more. I was a bit bummed because with house prices going up everything in my price range was in the suburbs or a cookie cutter townhome. I considered upping my price range but something I'd like would be around $700K and I couldn't see myself justifying a place like that for just myself 

Looking at rentals in the new area I'm probably up to $2300 for somewhere I'd like to live. I don't love the fact my rent would be almost doubling by moving, but mentally just offset it by saying theres no state income tax where I'm moving so I'll have more take home (not a wash, just a make myself feel better). 

When I look at the rental costs it kind of makes me reconsider some of those non-ideal home options such as the townhomes. The mortgage would be a little bit more than rent but I can still afford it. I don't have a strong NEED to own a home or anything and have enjoyed renting relatively hassle free and being able to move around freely.

If we went for 20% on a house, we'd nail the student loan debt away as soon as she returned to work.

To give you my backstory, I left a retail store two months ago making $21 hour full time supervisor due to layoff. Iâ€™ve recently applied at my local T-Mobile store since the position is sales and got offered part time $16 hr but was told I can possibly make more because of commission.

Thereâ€™s a lot of social pressure for everyone to buy a house when they can. I was currently planning on buying one soon as well but now Iâ€™m having second thoughts about doing so.

Iâ€™m currently a 25 year old single guy. My total gross annual income is about $110-120k. I expect to get promotions every couple of years or so for the next decade or so so my compensation should grow about 5-10% a year on average until my mid thirties when promotions will become less frequent.

I currently have about $250k saved up. $150k of that is in a taxable brokerage account and the rest is in retirement accounts. I currently save about $50k/year including all employer matches and incentives.

So I feel like financially I can buy a house especially if I save for another year or two, but Iâ€™m not sure if I want to yet.

I really enjoy where Iâ€™m renting now. I really donâ€™t have anything negative to say about my apartment and the community Iâ€™m renting in has a lot of great ammenities and neighbors.

mminfh,ORCoast19,"LARK seems like a good buy

This small regional bank has some nice things going for it. Theyâ€™ve consistantly grown their business over the years. Theyâ€™ve benefited in a positive way from the PPP business loans, most of which wonâ€™t be paid down early as companies seek flexibility. They have a ~3% dividend, and typical issue a 5% stock dividend each year. They have a price to earnings around 6 right now. Theyâ€™re around the same stock price they were 3 years ago when they were making half as much annually. Finally, my personal favorite, I contacted their investor relations and the CFO emails me back with answers within 24 hours. I love small businesses where people wear multiple hats, and this place must have hired at least *one* guy who likes to work.

Edit: 
1. Thank you for the guy researching the temperory impact of the PPP loan and placing it around 100 Mil in loan growth through the program, referencing that most growth has been non PPP in 2020. This makes sense as there were a lot of restrictions with the PPP (limit on company distributions for instance) making it a less desireable option for business owners if you could get something elsewhere. 

2. Someone brought up an acquisition potentially capping the value of the stock. Funny thing with that is that there are two â€œLandmarkâ€ banks, this one and one on the east coast. On LARKâ€™s investor relations page they have a highlight talking about the investor confusion and how theyâ€™re not related/not affected by the acquisition.

poalt5,ORCoast19,"Thoughts on investing in energy &amp; inflation with OXY/WS?

Iâ€™ve been buying OXY/WS this month, kicking myself for not buying them a year ago when I first learned of them. OXY/WS is the cheapest way to invest in OXY if you believe the share price will go up significantly. They essentially give you the right to buy shares at $22 plus the current warrant price. You have up until Aug 3 2027 to exercise this right. These warrants were issued to OXY shareholders during hard times in 2020, to throw them a bone, but I imagine most bailed as the stock collapsed. 

Four reasons I like this play areâ€¦

1. Rising Free Cash Flow. Occidential petroleum has been benefiting from an increasing WTI crude oil price, hovering around $70/barrel as of today. Last quarter it averaged around $65/barrel, and they had cash flow in that quarter above 2 billion (market cap is currently ~24.4 billion for reference). Cash flow should continue to increase as crude price increases, and they work to pay down their crippling debt.

2. The Crippling Debt is Going Away. No one likes debt, right? Especially crippling debt that might bankrupt you in a sudden, extreme downturn? *cough* Covid 2020 *cough*. Apparently management got the message that their debt load could kill them, and have a plan to reduce debt by over 40%, planning to drop from 34 billion in debt at the end of 2020 to 20 billion in debt at the end of 2022. As debt gets paid down the current interest payments of 300+ million/quarter will reduce to under 200 million/quarter, adding over half a billion extra to their free cash flow!

3. Inflation Hedge. OXY has a lot of hard assets, and if US inflation takes off their stock should rise. An example of these hard assets can be found in their land holdings- they own over 1.35 million acres in the permian basin alone. If inflation is high over the next 6 years, I feel the time value of OXY/WS is being very underappreciated. As of today that time value is under $6 per warrant. 

4. Future Energy Needs. Going back to the permian basin, the land that oxy has might one day be reused for alternative energy. Believe it or not, massive solar projects can hit a wall due to environmental groups. Belowâ€™s a link of this issue recently cropping up in San Diego County. For some reason, I donâ€™t think Texas will give a damn about environmental issues, making that previously mentioned 1.35 million acres in the permian basin prime real estate for massive solar projects. In addition to solar potential, OXY has also been working on CO2 sequestering using their pre-existing oil drilling footprint.

r31dag,ORCoast19,"Thoughts on Northwest Natural? NWN?

Hey Everyone, 
I wanted to get folks opinions on NWN. NWN is a natural gas and water utility provider based primarily in OR and WA. P/E at todayâ€™s close is around 15, and revenue has been increasing low-single digits in recent years. 

Things I like about them include:

- I lived in OR for several years and was both a residential and business customer of theirs. I know their CS is top notch / mailed statements professional /emergency response *fast* (less than 30 mins on a Friday)
- They should be pretty COVID proof, and they have a regulated monopoly. Folks need heat and theyâ€™ve been supplying since the late 1800â€™s.
- They advertise in their annual reports that they have one of the best maintained systems in the country.

Things I donâ€™t like about them include:
- Being a mature utility, Iâ€™m told these trade like bonds at times, and a shift in interest rates can shift their price up (on interest decrease) or down (on interest increase). 
- The NW seems to be having more weather related issues than say the midwest or northeast. For instance, wildfires in OR have been bad in recent years. I actually evacuated my house in 2020 because of them. Thereâ€™s also been droughts making wildfires more likely. Buying into NWN exposes you somewhat to these regional issues, and if it gets bad enough people move thats less customers. 
- The stock likely will never be the next apple, and Iâ€™m young/looking to grow wealth quickly and safely.

rc2mhe,ORCoast19,"VCSA went public this week

Hey Everyone, 
Vacasa, a vacation rental property management company, went public this week. If anyone is interested in them I wanted to share some of my industry experience on them and VRs in general. I competed with them in OR for 6 years and have met dozens of their owners and employees. 

On valuation, after-hours they were trading at a 4.13 billion market cap for ~30,000 properties. This equates to $137,700 per managed unit. Competing with them and other companies in Oregon, most small companies would sell for between $10,000 and $15,000 per unit. The company I worked for was a bottom dweller, and got some units below $7,500 at times. Theyâ€™re expecting 1.25 billion in revenue for 2021 with part of the year having Turnkeyâ€™s acquisition baked in. This means revenue per house is somewhere north of around $41,666 per house before they split out their fees, which isnâ€™t that bad. 

As this type of business scales the margin gets better and better. Managing 200+ units I had net profit margins before taxes around 10% for every dollar of revenue taken in to be split between owner and PM. At vacasaâ€™s scale I could see them getting this north of 20%. If they were just milking the business for cash/avoiding huge IPO-related management bonuses this would put their net profit EBITA at around ~250 million with the 2021 revenue numbers. Doesnâ€™t sound that bad, right?

The downside is theyâ€™ve made a bad name for themselves, and I think organic growth will be hard to come by. Hearing from old employees, management was pretty oblivious to field conditions and field staff member complaints. In a business like this, field staff is ~80% of your employees so imagine ignoring 4/5 of your employees. I recruited HKâ€™s from them all the time due to payroll issues, overwork, and scheduling favoritism. On the owner front, a guy with a townhome in Newport, OR actually reported they left a leak unchecked that caved in his third floor ceiling. Iâ€™ve signed owners further up the coast that found meth and needles *after* their cleaning team had gone in and completed a post stay clean. Operational issues seem to continue to grow but they keep scaling. 

From a revenue perspective, much of their growth stemmed from underpricing the competition dramatically when they started up. This worked for ~5 years where they were able to produce better owner returns due to price undercutting, but competition responded. Now, most owners will produce the same or less compared to homes managed by local competitors. A homeowner I signed from them, one of the first 200, summed it up by saying thereâ€™s too many homes pulling from the same traffic. They havenâ€™t scaled customers as theyâ€™ve scaled, diluting homeowner results. 

In summary, I think the operational issues will limit organic growth, and their profit potential wonâ€™t be realized because management isnâ€™t hungry. Why would you be, being the biggest vacation rental pm in the US? 

Iâ€™ll be a buyer around $2/share, or higher if they step back from their growth plans and focus on their ground game.

Each managed vacasa unit is essentially 137k+ to buy, crazy high.","Anchoring, Confirmation Bias, Self-Attribution Bias, Affect Heuristic","The statement exhibits several biases.

Iâ€™m a fan of the company because theyâ€™re paying down billions in debt each year, and having worked for a highly leveraged company in the past I know how fabulous that can make earnings going forward. Each quarter they get 10â€™s of millions more profit for future quarters due to less debt repayment. They also have over 10 billion in FCF this year if oil stays at its current heights and lots of tangible assets if inflation gets out of control.

ek077s,OutdoorJimmyRustler,"Help Understanding Arbitrage Concept and Theoretical Scenario

I figured some of the bond traders on here might be able to gauge my rationale behind these assumptions.

Many cities across the United States are issuing Pension Obligation Bonds (""POB's"") to pay down pension debt.  In most cases, cities are members of a State-administered investment pool.  Cities are required to pay into the investment pool based on a formula that is multiplied by the quantity of employees that they have in the system.  The pension recipients have promised benefit amounts (defined benefit).  If the State-administered fund fails to make a return that is high enough to cover the increasing costs of benefits, the State basically charges cities to make up the delta.  This is becoming increasingly common.  Usually, cities do not have the money up front to pay this delta, so it sits on their books as an Unfunded Accrued Liability or ""UAL."" 

In California, the State-administered pension system charges municipalities that have a UAL *interest* on the UAL principal based on the State-administered pensions system's estimated investment return.  If the State thinks they can make a 7% market return, they charge municipalities a 7% interest penalty on their UAL principal.  The State does this because if the municipality had actually paid the UAL up front, the State would have taken that UAL principal and made an additional 7% on it.

In response, cities in California have been issuing POB's that have a fixed interest rate of 3-4%.  They pay the UAL principal down, avoid having a 7% interest rate (in place of the lower 3-4% interest rate), and save money in the long run.  

1. Is this what *arbitrage* is?  Taking out a loan for 3%, thus *""*making"" 4%?  

2. The 7% charge from the State pension system in California fluctuates.  There's talk of the State lowering that return projection, which could mitigate the savings made by cities that issue POB's at 3-4% interest.  As such, opponents of this strategy have attacked the rationale behind POB's.  In theory, the State pension system could make a negative return.  When that happens, cities get charged to make up the difference between the assets of the funds and the liability of payments owed to pensioners.  In theory, a city could take out a 3% POB, pay their UAL, and receive a negative return on a huge principal in the short run if the market crashes.    My response to this has been that since we have to pay the UAL anyways, it makes no difference if we pay it now or later.  No one can time the market (certainly, municipalities can't), so it makes do difference if we pay the UAL when the market is growing or contracting.  Thoughts on this?","Loss Aversion, Status Quo Bias, Present Bias","The statement reflects several biases.

10cnz2n,outskirtsofparadise,"My federal tax liabilities for '22 tax year

I'm trying to work through what I owe (if I do) in federal  taxes (and specifically long-term capital gains or ltcg) for '22 and trying to determine whether I owe estimated tax.  Background details:

1. Single Filer, in my 40s  and assume no previous liability from prior tax years
2. I had income from a part-time, temporary job for a portion of the year:  $7500
3. My W2 shows I paid $235 in federal taxes for aforementioned income (also paid approp state tax)
4. I took distributions from my IRA to assist with  my  Advanced Degree study (early contribution exempted from penalty bc its used for tuition): $21,094
5. From the IRA distributions above, I withheld $3000 for Federal Taxes; in addition I also withheld for state taxes at my state's local flat tax rate.  (Looks like I overpaid on Fed Tax)
6. I cashed out on long-term stock (&gt; 1yr)  I owned through a taxable investment account at various points throughout the year.  Total Gains from stock sales: $30,000. 
7. Assume no short-term gains (ie $0)

&amp;#x200B;

Here's my understanding of the total tax I owe on Ordinary Income (OI):

1. Combine W2 and IRA Contributions:  $37500
2. I'm taking the  standard deduction for this example which I believe is  $12,950 for '22.
3. Determine Taxable Income:  $37500 - $12,950 = $24,550
4. That would imply that my fed taxes due on OI would be: (10% \* $10,275) + (.12 \* $14,275)  = $2740.5 

&amp;#x200B;

LTCG Taxes:

Based on  [this](https://www.fiphysician.com/capital-gains-stack-on-top-of-ordinary-income/) explanation, my understanding is I wouldn't owe taxes on my LTCG  because the total gains are less than $41,675   (the page is old and the tax rates are outdated but I'm trying to follow the formula). 

&amp;#x200B;

Question:

So is it correct to say that the total federal tax obligation for '22  would  be the $2,740.5 based on the information provided above assuming all numbers are accurate and complete?

Let's assume the investor's gains for that year (from trading + interest) are near 10k

For the remainder of the  year, the investor doesn't have access to either the principal or the gains. 

What options does this person have when filing federal taxes for that tax year understanding that they will most likely only receive a fraction of their assets back when the dust settles (though that's not know at the time of filing)?

Thanks!","Loss Aversion, Regret Aversion, Sunk Cost Fallacy","The scenario presented involves a complex situation where an investor's assets are frozen due to Voyager's Chapter 11 restructuring. The investor is concerned about the tax implications and potential loss of assets. Loss Aversion is likely present as the investor is worried about losing a significant portion of their $200k portfolio. Regret Aversion may also be at play as the investor might feel regretful about investing in Voyager and may be seeking to minimize further losses. Additionally, Sunk Cost Fallacy could be influencing the investor's decision-making, as they may feel inclined to hold on to their investment, despite the uncertainty and potential losses, due to the resources already committed.","The user exhibits a tendency to prioritize avoiding losses and regret, while also being influenced by past investments, indicating a bias towards loss aversion, regret aversion, and sunk cost fallacy."
xc3obo,outskirtsofparadise,"Bank Bail-ins and Brokerages

I've been reading up on bank bail-ins, which to my understanding is a means for banks to convert your savings as assets on their balance sheet  (making you an unsecured creditor) to keep their operations going. Assuming bail-ins went into effect, I could see the following situation arise:  bank accounts would be frozen and or with-drawls restricted for a period of time while  banks stabilize operations.   I was wondering how this would affect money in brokerage accounts. Would I still be able to access:

1. money in my investment or cash account that was not part of a bank sweep but invested in a money market fund. In other words, if bank accounts were frozen, could I still access and sell money market funds, and use the proceeds freely?
2. money in fidelity's fcash position in their investment account, which I understand is not fdic-insured and basically operates as a holding tank for buying and selling funds, depositing dividends, etc. I presume since this is not FDIC-insured, it's also not subject to the same restrictions that banks have or require.

Please note: I'm not interested in debating the merits or probabilities of bail-ins occurring. I'm just curious whether these options could alleviate limits on access to funds should something like this occur.  TIA.

Does anyone happen to know what it means / what it's looking for, or whether I need to claim this twice on my return for some reason?

11ns6yl,paulrudder,"Tax question I can't seem to find the answer to: Can I delete $0 sales from my 1099-B?

I tried posting this on r/tax and didn't get any replies, so I thought maybe someone here might know.

I'm using TurboTax and imported all my crypto transactions from 2022 via CoinTracker, which auto generated a 1099-B listing every single transaction.

I guess because I earned weekly ""Staking"" rewards (similar to interest or dividends) through exchanges like Coinbase, I have small transactions for fractions of tokens being received for $0. Just as a hypothetical, let's say I bought 999.95 XLM tokens (a pretty cheap coin) and staked them... each week I might have received 0.005 XLM's as a ""reward,"" but each of those distributions have a $0 value because they're practically worthless.

When I sold/disposed of some of these holdings later on, CoinTracker automatically accounted for every single lot I ever received of each coin, even though many of these micro transactions of received interest/staking were virtually worthless.

So for example let's say I sold 1,000 XLM, and 999.95 of those were what i originally purchased, and the other .05 were the total of all my staking rewards for the year... It's showing on my 1099-B a ""sell"" transaction for *every single staking lot I received,* and every single one of them has a $0 value. 

Because CoinTracker is reporting and tracking every single one of these $0 staking rewards, they are showing up on my form 1099-B, so I have a bunch of $0 sales listed. TurboTax is flagging these as an error and asking me to adjust the cost basis, but I can't, because they are essentially worthless. I guess TurboTax is confused because normally if you're selling something it has a value, but in this case each lot is so small and miniscule that there's literally no dollar value attached.

All this being said, I'm assuming I should just go ahead and delete anything that is $0, correct? I don't need to document sales of small lots with a worth of $0? Even if all those lots combined added up to a few cents, it's not like I'm going to get in trouble for not claiming them, correct?

I purchased my home for $144k in 2019 and I've paid down the principal to $135k. A decent amount of my monthly mortgage payment goes towards PPI which I'd love to have removed. I'm in PA and my understanding is that it automatically falls off after you reach 20% equity in your home? Which in my case I think would mean paying it down by about $30k.

But the estimated value has risen exponentially over the past 4 years and it says it's worth at least $200k now and I know homes have sold for around $220k on my street.

So my questions are:

* if I just make additional payments on the principal will it automatically fall off once I pay it down by that \~20% number?
* is it worth paying for someone to come out and do an evaluation of the property, and if they estimate it's worth more and I already have 20% equity in the home, would I be able to send that info to my mortgage lender and they'd basically just remove the PMI?

It's embarrassing to admit but I have about $25k in credit card debt at the moment.  Fortunately half of that is on a 0%apr transfer card, and the rest is on a relatively low interest card (13.99%).

I was making more money in 2020-2022 and just got hit with a lot of setbacks this year, including medical expenses blah blah... end of the day it doesn't really matter, but I started relying on my card more thinking I'd be able to pay it down with each month's commission check, but then there was always something random and unexpected that would set me back further, like an $1800 vet bill. 

All that being said my income is decent at about $100k/yr... but after taxes, medical deductions, 401k, etc. I have only netted about $55k this year. So at first glance it sounds like I should be able to pay off this debt ASAP with my income level, but the reality is I'd have to pause my 401k contributions to really increase my take home pay and there's not much I can do about high taxes and medical insurance deductions.

esjyie,paulrudder,"Is my homeowners' insurance going to go up because of this?

I made another topic earlier in r/HomeImprovement and got some good feedback. TL;DR version -- someone threw a rock through my double pane window last night and it shattered the outer pane. Didn't notice until this morning, called the police and the guy who came out told me to check with my insurance company and see if there's a deductible for vandalism since I'm basically S.O.L. in terms of them catching whoever did it.

I didn't realize I have an insurance *agent* that I'm supposed to contact first (only been a homeowner for a year), so I called the insurance company directly and explained what happened to the rep. He told me he would have to pass it along to their claims department and have someone give me a call. I reiterated that I wasn't interested in filing a claim at this point but just wanted to know what my deductible would be... and he said he couldn't tell me until they looked it over. I feel like he pulled one over on me because I later found out that by passing it to their claims department it was processed as a claim.

Someone in the original topic about the window damage told me that this could go on my account history, and that I should have called my agent first for advice. So I found my agent's info and called them and they told me to call the insurance company back and cancel the claim. Called them back and it had already been assigned to some guy in the claims department. Got his voicemail. An hour later he emails me back and says he canceled the claim for me. I replied and asked to clarify whether this would go on my account history and he said he couldn't tell me that, and that for rate-related questions I needed to ask my agent.

Called my agent back, and she told me I'll probably be OK since it was canceled so quickly and that she wouldn't worry about it, but that she won't be able to tell for a few months and that the best time to check is when my policy is due for renewal and we can address it then.

ewqdao,paulrudder,"Is it possible to deduct the expense for LinkedIn Sales Navigator when I file taxes? (I work in sales.)

I work for a major telecom company, and my role is in outside sales. Despite trying numerous times to make a case for LinkedIn Sales Navigator (which is a prospecting tool that is *awesome* for finding leads and bypassing gatekeepers, but also happens to cost $60/mo annually and $80/mo without contract), my company won't allow me to expense the cost -- most likely because if they allowed me to, then every sales rep would want to across the nation. They also have licensing agreements with specific software/websites (like AdMall) so I would imagine it might be against some kind of pact they have with them, but that's just speculation.

Anyway, I really, really love the tool and actually made a sale with it in the past for $6k/year, so I know it works. But I hate the idea of paying that much money out of pocket each month. Yeah, it could very well offset its cost if I bring in even just a couple big purchasers -- but it's still a little tough to swallow a $720 price tag.

So my question is -- I know in the past when I use TurboTax it will ask if I have work expenses and receipts. I usually don't put anything in, since my company will reimburse me for small things (e.g. if I needed to buy a charger for my work phone, or something like that). But would I be able to itemize/deduct a substantial cost item like the membership to LinkedIn Sales Nav? 

I did Google the question but didn't really find very definitive answers. I asked LinkedIn directly and they directed me towards one of the somewhat vague articles about it.

I'm in debt, trying to pay it down as aggressively as possible. I listen to Dave Ramsey and he always tells callers not to have any extra tax withheld from their pay checks because it's basically giving the government a free loan all year.

I went into my employer's HR web portal and clicked on my tax withholding, and it just has a box to enter ""number of exemptions."" Initially I believe I had 0 exemptions for both state and federal. Right now I have 2 for federal (changed it in December based on the advice of a coworker) and 0 for my state (which is PA).  However I don't know if 2 is too many, too little, etc. -- I don't want to owe money but I also don't extra withheld.

fceo91,paulrudder,"Should I re-finance my mortgage for a lower interest rate?

I bought my first home in Jan 2019 and was locked in @ 5.125% with an FHA loan, 30 years fixed. The original loan amount was for $140,400 and my current balance is $138,189, so I've paid it down only a couple thousand dollars. My taxes and insurance are escrowed in.

For the past year I've been actively paying against my credit card debt. I'm embarrassed to say I had it up to $30k at one point (long story - combo of immaturity, lack of budgeting skills and quite honestly a depressive period where I felt defeated) but I've wisened up, learned a lot, and am on a written budget now. I've brought it down to $18.5k at this point with no frivolous spending, but it's been tough and I have had the Murphys Law setbacks, e.g. I switched to a cheaper car insurance policy but didn't realize it had to be paid in full for the entire year in cash, so suddenly my $80/mo insurance budget was an $850 bill. ðŸ˜‚ Then I had someone throw a rock through my living room window and had to shell out $350 for repairs... But that's life right? 

Anyway, the ""0% APR balance transfer"" cards I had transferred my two highest balances to will be ending in a few months. (they are typically 18 months.) once the promo ends the APR is ridiculously high, ranging from 24â€”30%.

I was considering opening more promotional zero APR balance transfer lines of credit, but I'm wondering if it makes more sense to consolidate the remaining balances onto a personal loan/debt consolidation service.

I have been trying to snowball my debt and have whittled down my credit cards from $30k to $16k in about a year and a half (I know, it's embarrassing, but I was very dumb and naive and maybe a little self destructive after college and got in so deep I stopped caring for a while - it's been a humbling path to pay it all down, haha).

Discover offered me a 60mos loan for $15k @ 10.99 apr and I was considering taking it.

Basically the only way to buy is to ""swap"" bitcoin or USDT (a stable coin tied to the US dollar) for this new crypto coin. 

So, I withdrew about 60 XLM coins (roughly $23 usd) from my wallet and sent it to another app called Kucoin. I then sold the 60 XLM for ~$23 USDT (again, this being a stable coin but not actually USD) and *then* used that USDT balance to purchase this new coin. 

Now, I guess my question is this: when I sold my 60 XLM coins for USDT, there's probably a cost basis involved... But since this is taking place on a different app from Coinbase, how do I ""consolidate"" or calculate those numbers?

Those are pretty much my only options besides a bond index fund (don't think I want that), a stable value fund (probably not?) and then alternative large/small cap funds that I think are not run by Vanguard. I'll probably just stick to the Vanguard ones.

Just wondering if my allocation sounds OK given my age etc. I'm 33 so I don't mind a bit more risk right now.

Because I would be financing the buyout and if I wait till the end of the lease, interest rates will likely go up.

Ok, I know this is really idiotic but here goes: I make 290 gross and want to know if I can afford 5-6k/mo for an apartment. I live and work in NYC. 

Please note the question is CAN I AFFORD IT, not why do I dislike mice... 
 
A few years ago, I bought my NYC apartment Iâ€™d been renting for ages when my landlord decided to sell, and I intended to retire there. Great area, nice place, quiet, nice neighbors, CLEAN, high ceilings, good sun, right price. Emphasis on the clean. Maintenance only $1100 (low for my area). 

I have an extremely serious mouse phobia and it was a key thing when I bought it that Id never seen any vermin, which is rare in NYC. 

So during covid with a lot of restaurants closing and buildings vacant, including one right next to mine, all of a sudden I see a mouse in my apartment. I had my super repair some holes under the sink and three weeks went by and I saw another one (or the same one, larger). So I had a pest home sealing service come and also collars put on the risers, but there are no guarantees and mice could still get in through the heating system and a/c, front door, holes under shelving and holes over kitchen cabinets. The problem is, others in the building are having this issue and it is still not solved. The management company changed personnel recently and they changed exterminators also. 

Ive been staying with relatives ever since seeing the second one but itâ€™s a bit crowded. Some will say I shouldnâ€™t be afraid of mice, but I am and for me they are scarier than a gas leak. I loved my place but having thought about it for a long time I just will not feel relaxed there anymore. Even if I never see another one I will be nervous and on edge. 

I looked at other places to rent and nice one bedrooms in luxury buildings (with no mouse risk) go for $5-10,000, and those are the reasonable ones!!

So thatâ€™s the issue, can I afford to rent something nice for a year or two until I decide whether to sell, keep or rent out my apartment? Should I stay with relatives until the building resolves this issue? I can get about 600k now if I sell it. 

Or should I just leave NYC if I get a WFH offer because the money here and quality of life no longer makes sense for me? I donâ€™t have contacts elsewhere.

Is this an inexpensive rate and a good deal I should keep, especially now in a pandemic, or is this expensive and I should get rid of it. 

Thanks in advance.

UPDATE: My other options through work are:
$840 a year for $232,000 term life or
$980 a year for $464,000. 

would that make better sense?

Initially, they frame the $2300 annual expense as ""not chump change,"" implying that the cost is significant, which might be an attempt to justify the expense. When presented with alternative options, they seem to be considering a change, but their initial hesitation to cancel the insurance suggests a Status Quo Bias, where they prefer to maintain the current situation. The fact that they ultimately canceled the extra insurance and reverted to a more basic coverage suggests that they were influenced by the Sunk Cost Fallacy, where they considered the ""sunk cost"" of the premium paid and decided to cut their losses. The Framing Effect is also present, as the user's perception of the insurance's value changes based on the presented options and the context of the pandemic.","The user exhibits a tendency to cling to the status quo and be influenced by previously incurred costs, which leads to a biased evaluation of the insurance's value."

Should treasurys be purchased in a tax deferred 401k account or in a taxable brokerage for the best tax treatment?

For example, if one invests in the TSP G Fund, a treasury fund in a 401k, is one losing the tax benefit since withdrawals will be taxed as ordinary income? Or do they retain the beneficial tax  treatment in the 401k?

My only other debt is student loan debt, which is a couple federal loans and a private loan. Total monthly payment is $525, rates vary between 3.2% to 4.2%.

I budgeted $400 a month for food as a single dude. I need to stop eating out so much as itâ€™s incredibly unhealthy. My work also buys my lunch, so that covers one meal for 4 days a week.

Iâ€™ve factored in other stuff like utilities, car insurance, and stuff like that. I can provide more detail if needed.

My checks will increase by about $150 after taxes next year without a raise. This is because Iâ€™ll have cheaper insurance and can lower my per paycheck 401k deduction and still hit the max (I missed the first couple paychecks due to having to get everything set up this year so Iâ€™m playing catch up essentially)

Iâ€™m anticipating when the new taxes kicks in on the property, itâ€™ll raise the monthly to $1900/month

My guess is with the economic situation, the bonus will end up being closer to 10% and itâ€™s paid in April of every year. I did not factor this into any calculation. Bonus is just extra to me.

Where should I look to cut if necessary? Should I cut back on the 401k to get more cash flow? Say cutting it down to $15,000 a year instead of the full $22,500?

Hi PF, 

Long story short, I purchased my first home! Which of course introduces the new debt of 6.875% for a 210k mortgage. Wondering how y'all would approach my mix of debt.

For context, I max out my 401k and intend to max out my Roth IRA.

I am paid every two weeks, for the purpose of my budget I used 2 checks a month (which means 2 pay checks totaling $4550 cash are unaccounted for, as is my annual bonus which can range from 6k after taxes to 11k after taxes.

&#x200B;

My mortgage with property taxes and insurance is $1925/month (no PMI).

My student loans are a mix:

Federal Loan 1: $3500 @ 3.2% (monthly $15)

Federal Loan 2: $5900 @ 3.5% (monthly $35)

Federal Loan 3: $3700 @ 3.2% (monthly $25)

Federal Loan 4: $8000 @ 4.2% (monthly $50)

Private Loan: $48,500 @ 3.5% (monthly $400)

These rates are the historical rates before the interest rate went to zero. I am operating under the assumption that these will be the rates come next month. The monthly amounts are also based on the graduated plan I was on at the time.

&#x200B;

Again, my only other debt is my new mortgage, $210,000 @ 6.875%

&#x200B;

After all my bills, I will have anywhere from $1100 - $1200 left (one of my utility bills is covered, in case someone is doing the math and wonder if my expenses seem slightly low).

&#x200B;

I will need to replenish my cash as after I furnish my living room and other smaller items I will have about 15k cash on hand so the e-fund will need to be built up to cover 6 months of the new and higher expense amount.

But afterwards, what's the best way to proceed with the debt? Take out some of the smaller student loans to begin snowballing and free up cash flow? Or hit the mortgage as much as I can?

&#x200B;

Come 2024, my monthly left over after bills will between $1300-1400 as I''ll be getting a small raise and won't need to take out as much per paycheck for my 401k to max it (i started like 3-4 checks behind this year on contributing, so nothing huge but positive nonetheless.","Present Bias, Sunk Cost Fallacy, Affect Heuristic","The user's statement reveals several biases.

Hi all - 

Can now see the interest rate on my student loans and trying to figure out the best debt to approach.

I am late 20s single man. No kids, just two pets.

Salary is 110k, I am paid biweekly, but I budget my monthly stuff on two checks so I have two ""extra"" checks a year. I max out my 401k so my bring home after all deductions and taxes is $4600 a month.

My bonus is target of 15%, but its likely to be more like 10-12k this upcoming spring.

I intend to continue to max my Roth IRA every year as well.

&#x200B;

My debts:

Mortgage of 212k @ 6.9% (total PITI is $1925 a month), brand new mortgage as I just got the house two months ago.

Federal Student loan debt broken out in five different loans, I currently utilize the ""Graduated Plan"" so the monthly amounts will go up in 24 months (about $6-$10 per loan):

Loan1: $3500 @ 4% ($21/month)

Loan2: $6000 @ 3.5% ($35/month)

Loan3: $3700 @ 3.5% ($22/month)

Loan4: $4100 @ 4.2% ($25/month)

Loan5: $4000 @ 4.2% ($25/month)

I also have a private student loan of 50k @ 3.5% ($400/month)

&#x200B;

Once I have my initial small projects done (mostly cosmetic stuff) for the house, I will still have enough cash for an emergency fund, which I intend to put into an online HYSA (recommendations for who to use for HYSA is welcomed, right now I am looking at SoFi).

&#x200B;

Since the mortgage is a high dollar amount, I was thinking of paying loans 5 and 4 off quickly and then roll into loan 1. After that I am not sure if I should hit the 50k loan or the mortgage.

The housing payment hurts, but I needed to move. I was living with my parents and the house got crowded with a sibling and their kids moving in. Part of me feels bad for leaving the free setup I had (I did stuff around the house for them to compensate) but hindsight shows if I didn't buy when I did, between rate hikes and the surge in my local home prices, I would have been priced out, or living in a super shady area.

kr8745,PM_ME_YOUR_CATS_PAWS,"Can I afford to buy a condo/house?

I'll try to keep this as brief as possible while providing all the numbers.

I currently make 74k (this may bump up to 80k with a new job soon, but sticking with the 74k for now).

I (24) live at home with family but it is admittedly becoming more and more stressful, sadly. My biggest bills are these:

Car: $290 a month, balance of $9500, 4.25%

Car insurance paid semi-annually comes out to $165 a month (love living in MI for car insurance! /s)

Private student loan: $1200 a month, balance of $60k, 3.6% **Note: I pay an extra $900 here every month.**

Federal student loans: no payment currently due to covid. usually $125 a month total (these are several smaller loans), rates ranging from 3.2 - 3.4%.

&amp;#x200B;

My retirement is actively being funded with a balance of $4500 in a 401(k) and another $25,000 in IRA's.

&amp;#x200B;

Here's where my thought process is, I have a quote for the private loan for 15 years 3.9% to bring the monthly down to $450. I could do that and use the extra money plus liquid cash (about 18k on hand) to pay off my car and save $290 a month, my credit union recalculates the loan when paid ahead, so if I wanted to pay half of it off now they would adjust the monthly payment to basically finish the loan on schedule on the new balance.

&amp;#x200B;

I am assuming rates for a mortgage would be about 4% give or take a little, my credit is 740 but i feel like the large student loan balance will pull me away from the rock bottom rates. I do not carry a credit card balance, it is paid in full each month.

&amp;#x200B;

Living in MI, housing is pretty cheap. A nice area I could get a good condo or home for 180 - 200k, I've had bank tools tell me I could afford 250-275k, but I know that is way beyond what I could realistically afford without being house poor. I am keeping an eye on possible smaller condos for the range of 130-150k (think \~800 sqft) I am just worried about resale value on these as I won't be able to grow into it and would seller it earlier than I would a condo or house that is slightly larger.

&amp;#x200B;

An alternative is to take the $900 extra off the big student loan and put that on my car now, but I feel like a $1200 payment is unsustainable when owning a condo/house.  

&amp;#x200B;

My budget shows I should be able to afford this with several hundred dollars left over each month but I am concerned I am missing something since this would be such a big step. I've included the utilities I can think of: phone, internet, cable, water, electric, gas etc. Though I have seen some condos that have gas/water included in the HOA fees (the HOA fee is also apart of my budget).

m9jj1i,PM_ME_YOUR_CATS_PAWS,"Need opinions on which loan term

Alright, buckle up, this will be a long one but I want to be as thorough as possible here.

24M, single, living with my parents currently.

Income: $78,000. 

Location: LCOL Midwestern metropolitan area.

Investments: 30k in retirement accounts with another 2k to go to reach the annual max on my Roth IRA, another $8500 in a normal taxable account. These are down currently but in decent holdings and nothing terribly risky just been a rough month for a couple holdings.

Debt:

Federal student loans: 21k, currently not paying due to relief. Typical payments are about $200/month before COVID. Rates vary between 3.2% - 3.4% if I remember correctly.

Private student loans 55k, 3.6% interest for 5 years (about 4.5 remaining on it), minimum payment is $1100/month, I am currently paying $2100/month on them.

Car loan: 9k at 4.25% interest, payment is $275/month, currently paid ahead so technically I don't need to pay for a year on it, but I plan to wipe it out by end of summer anyways.

No other expenses outside of your normal car insurance, gas, etc. 

&amp;#x200B;

Now that you have a clear picture of my financial situation, lets get down to the real question.

&amp;#x200B;

I am looking to refinance those private student loans, the issue is I am not sure what type of term I want to go with. My offers are:

15 years, 3.51%, $395/month

10 years, 3.31%, 545/month

7 years, 3.19%, $730/month

5 years, 3.16%, $1000/month

&amp;#x200B;

Here's why I am struggling to pick between these, all of which are lower than my current 3.6% rate:

I really like the ultra low rate of 3.16% and the idea of paying way less in interest. However, I would like to move out soonish, I've been looking at the time frame as early as this summer, or as late as next summer, with the fall of this year being a rather ideal time. In addition to that, I am not sure if I will be staying in my current location or moving to a city in Florida (not Miami/Ft. Lauderdale area, but don't really want to name it to keep this somewhat anonymous). According to most cost of living calculators, it seems my targeted area in Florida is about the same as my targeted area if I stayed in my home state, so while it would be more expensive than staying home, those two options are essentially the same price. My current state has an income tax whereas Florida does not, which is also a small thing to consider but is not my reason for relocating.

&amp;#x200B;

I am not sure whether the $1000 a month plan is really feasible once I start assuming my own living expenses or not. While one option is to take the 5 year plan now and refinance again prior to moving, I fear rates may start to increase and thus the longer term rates would be higher at that point in time. Obviously no one can predict the future, so it's rather hard to mathematically account for it. 

&amp;#x200B;

So I guess the crux of this is, what would you do? Pursue the ultra low rate or accept a rate slightly higher (but still lower than your current rate) to give you more room to work with in pursuing a goal to move.","Loss Aversion, Anchoring, Present Bias, Regret Aversion","The individual is exhibiting multiple biases in their decision-making process. Loss Aversion is present as they are hesitant to take on a higher monthly payment ($1000/month for 5 years) despite the ultra-low interest rate of 3.16%, fearing that it may not be feasible once they start assuming their own living expenses. This concern about potential losses (financial strain) is driving their aversion to the 5-year plan. Anchoring is also evident as they are fixated on the ultra-low rate of 3.16% and are considering it as the primary factor in their decision. Additionally, Present Bias is influencing their decision as they prioritize short-term financial flexibility over long-term interest savings. Regret Aversion is also present as they fear that choosing the 5-year plan and then refinancing at a potentially higher rate in the future could lead to regret.","The individual tends to prioritize short-term financial flexibility and avoid potential losses, often at the expense of long-term interest savings, indicating a bias towards present-focused and loss-averse decision-making."

**Student Loan Payments:** $520 at a 3.5% interest rate.

**Car Payment:** $275 at a 4.25% interest rate, this is paid ahead until the end of next year, but I have $6000 to go. The car is only a couple years old and has super low miles.

&amp;#x200B;

**Car Insurance:** $150, yes I have already shopped around and priced what this could be if I adjusted my coverage after paying off my car, $150 seems to be about the floor as I am only 24 in a state known for high insurance rates.

&amp;#x200B;

**Gas**: I would say I spend about $75 in gasoline costs.

&amp;#x200B;

**Food:** I probably spend about $200 a month on average on food, maybe a bit less, moving out I expect this to go up a bit. Admittedly it is currently made up of eating out, but when I move I plan to make my own food much more often as I'll have the space to.

Outside of miscellaneous fun-spending, I don't have any other major bills.

I also have $20,000 in cash and will be seeing a one-time influx of cash this month of about $8000 after taxes.

I know for a fact I won't have 20%, and I am okay with this and the PMI it will incur.

Cable and Internet: $150

Electricity and Gas: $140

Water: $30

Phone: $50 (yes this isn't in the original expenses as I do not have to pay it while living at home)

an incremental increase in food of $250 ($450 total food costs)

Is there anything I am missing? I know the HOA for a condo will be one thing if I go that route, but aside from that, anything else?

&amp;#x200B;

I am trying to narrow down to what my PITI payment (+HOA if applicable) can be and still be comfortable so I can work that into what price range I can realistically afford.

&amp;#x200B;

If you think any of my projected expenses may be off based on experience, please let me know. For the purposes of this exercise, let's assume a $15000 down payment. I do not want to draw on my Roth IRA as rates are so low I feel as though I am better off keeping that money in the market and taking the slightly higher PMI.

I do have family/friends here but am not opposed to packing up and leaving. I really do love my job and my co workers as well. 

I currently live with my parents and have very little expenses. Pay $1000 per month to my parents for my school loans(0% interest) and pay for my groceries/gas(\~400/month in total).

ewtwo1,poqwrslr,"Tax Question: repaid income not reflected on W2

I had a job where part of my compensation was ""student loan repayment"" equaling $10,000 annually (or $384.62 per paycheck).  This ""student loan repayment"" is treated as income by the federal government and therefore subjected to all the same taxes that regular income incurs.  Therefore according to my understanding, while it can titled whatever my employer wants it is ""income"" by the federal government and treated as such.

I left this job early 2019, I believe my last day was 01/11/2019.  With leaving I was required to return a portion of the ""student loan repayment"" equaling $8,000.  In 2019 I earned a total of $8,274.88 from this employer.

I recently received my W2 from this employer and it shows the full wages of $8,274.88 without taking into consideration the $8,000 I repaid in mid-February 2019.  My employer is refusing to correct my W2 saying it's my job to deal with it on my taxes.  This difference in income results in an approximate $2,000 swing in my taxes (employer also screwed up my tax withholding on the $8,274.88 of income) + excess Social Security withholding they need to refund to me in the amount of $496.

So, in trying to deal with it, I have discussed with an accountant who agreed the returned $8,000 should decrease my 2019 wages by that $8,000.  Therefore she recommended trying to go back to my employer and again requesting a corrected W2 (which they are still refusing to do), or to submit a ""substitute W2"" using form 4852 which will of course trigger a review of my taxes and also any documents submitted by previous employer.

I have the copy of the ""student loan repayment"" agreement from when I was hired, including the emails showing the agreed upon $8,000 I repaid, the confirmation from my employer of them receiving and depositing the $8,000, and then of course a copy of the check showing payment/deposit in my bank's records.

Additionally, the individual's eagerness to seek input from others before filing taxes using form 4852 may indicate Regret Aversion, as they are trying to minimize the potential regret of making a wrong decision.

eyu3rn,poqwrslr,"Finance vs. Cash for ""new"" vehicle

Disclaimer: I know this question has been asked thousands of times, but unfortunately the search function brings up those thousands of results and it is quite difficult to sift through them.  So I apologize in advance.  If you want to link previous posts that apply please do!

I also read the wiki, and while it gives good advice on the process and preparing ahead of time, I didn't see where it specifically answered this question.

\---

Basically, my wife and I are expecting to purchase a newer used vehicle in approximately 12 months.  We have 1 kid, with another on the way.  While we could probably make our current vehicles (small to medium SUVs) work, with 3 dogs that we take with us everywhere having a large van (or possible larger SUV) will just make life easier.  We are expecting something $20k-$25k total purchase price.  Our plan would be to drive this vehicle into the ground...but of course we all know how that can go.

Bottom line, I was raised with the idea of NEVER financing a depreciating asset...with a vehicle being the #1 example.  But, if I have the ability to purchase a vehicle in cash without destroying my emergency fund vs. a VERY low interest auto loan which is better?

**Normal stats**:

* annual income = $120k + bonus
* already fully funding Roth IRAs, employer 403B, HSA
* current emergency fund of 3 months income (currently building back to 6 months, had some things occur in 2019 - expected to be back by end of March 2020)
* Student loan debt = \~$40k with 4 years left on loan at 3.375%

&amp;#x200B;

**Example 1**: $25,000 van paid in cash.  Done and done...obviously simpler...

**Example 2**: $25,000 with whatever down payment makes sense (say $10,000).  So $15k auto loan at 1.99% over 48 months (current offering from our local credit union with certain restrictions on vehicle age).  We still have $15,000 and keep in a HYSA or our KASASA checking with 4% interest (NOTE: this is separate from our emergency fund).  My calculation shows that on a $15k loan we would pay $617 in interest, while earning $2,601 at 4% over the same 48 months (NOTE: I am assuming our payments are NOT drawn from this account, but instead our monthly income).

The biggest thing I notice that I am ignoring is depreciation.  But, since we are purchasing used (plan is around 3 years old) the largest amounts of depreciation would have already occurred, plus the depreciation will occur either way loan vs. cash.

It is hard to go against what I have been told over, and over, and over again childhood to now, but I don't see the reason to just give up \~$2,000 over 4 years.  Please either confirm my thinking or show what I am missing.  Thanks all!","Loss Aversion, Status Quo Bias, Sunk Cost Fallacy, Authority Bias","The individual is hesitant to finance a depreciating asset, a notion that was instilled in him from childhood, demonstrating the influence of Authority Bias.

However, his reluctance to deviate from his ingrained principle indicates Status Quo Bias. Additionally, his dismissal of depreciation as a significant factor due to the vehicle's age and the fact that it would occur regardless of the financing choice may be an example of Loss Aversion, as he is downplaying a potential loss (depreciation) to justify his preferred choice. The consideration of earning interest on the remaining $15,000 in a high-yield savings account or KASASA checking account also reveals a Sunk Cost Fallacy-like mentality, as he is focusing on the potential gains from the loan option rather than the overall cost of ownership.","The individual exhibits a tendency to adhere to traditional financial wisdom and resist deviations from it, while also being influenced by the desire to avoid losses and maximize gains, indicating a bias towards maintaining the status quo and avoiding perceived financial risks."
flbyr1,poqwrslr,"Using 529 to pay my own Student Loans (SECURE Act)

I have tried to do some research on the SECURE Act and how it could benefit me as I pay off my student loans, but am struggling with a few details.  If someone could explain and also provide resources for reading that would be awesome, so thanks in advance.

My understanding is that with Trump signing the SECURE Act I can now use a 529 plan to pay my monthly student loan payment.  I live in MI, so it is also my understanding that I can deduct up to $10,000 of annual 529 contributions similar to deducting 401K contributions.

But, in reading this article ([https://www.usnews.com/education/best-colleges/paying-for-college/articles/what-to-know-about-paying-student-loans-with-529-plan-funds](https://www.usnews.com/education/best-colleges/paying-for-college/articles/what-to-know-about-paying-student-loans-with-529-plan-funds)) it discusses a lifetime limit of $10,000 to pay off student loans without taxes or penalties:

""The Setting Every Community Up for Retirement Enhancement Act, a spending bill known as the SECURE Act, established a lifetime limit of $10,000 from a 529 plan that can be used without any penalties or tax consequences to repay the beneficiary's student loans, including federal and most private loans.""

So, if I were to contribute $10,000 to a MI 529 plan this year and then use that to pay my student loan payments this year I would max that lifetime limit and the tax benefit of doing this is now nullified moving forward?  Also, can I create a 529 and make myself the beneficiary to even do this?

&amp;#x200B;

Again, thanks for any help people can impart.

&amp;#x200B;

Edit: also, if I do this payment now, would that effect my ability to help my kids using this tool in the future?

ft31ix,poqwrslr,"Invest vs. Pay off home

I'm curious with everything that is going on how this crisis may change people's mind on the idea of investing before paying off a home.  From a mathematical perspective, generally speaking you ""win"" by investing your excess wisely and paying the minimum on your home (assuming you don't over buy and don't end up in foreclosure or something).  But, mathematics get thrown out the window for reality when it comes down to it.

My grandparents grew up in the Great Depression and as a result paid for every home they ever owned in cash 100%.  Of course I do realize the cost of a house was different than now.

My parents have ALWAYS prioritized their investments and paid the minimum on their homes, even including their current.  My father is approximately 2 years from retirement and has around 20 years left on his mortgage.  He admits there is some stress to going into retirement with a mortgage, but he has a military pension that is as guaranteed as it gets (along with his own retirement savings).

My in-laws paid off their home within 3 years of buying (around 1993-94), and have actually lived in that home ever since.  My father-in-law readily admits that financially he knows he ""lost"" in doing so, but also says that the stress relief was worth it and he would do it again and again.

I have always liked the idea of paying some extra toward my home, but felt that should come after my tax advantaged investments (Roth IRA and 401k).  Plus, I still have student loans and feel like those should be prioritized before my mortgage.

With all of this said, I am one of the lucky ones whose income has remained intact during this crisis, and while there is some stress that could change I see it as unlikely (am a PA-C working both ortho and volunteering to help cover UC and ER shifts...so I'm ""useful"").

But, just curious if this historical event will lead some people to change their thought processes somewhat?  Especially when you couple loss of income with significant investment losses.  At our peak we had \~$260k which dropped to  \~$180k.  It's now clawed it's way back to \~$200k, but still sucks to just ""lose"" $60k almost overnight.","Loss Aversion, Status Quo Bias, Mental Accounting, Recency Bias, Affect Heuristic","The statement reflects several biases. The author's emphasis on the stress relief their in-laws experienced by paying off their home early, despite acknowledging it was not the optimal financial decision, suggests Loss Aversion, as they prioritize avoiding losses (in this case, emotional losses) over purely financial gains.

fx5ttv,poqwrslr,"Mortgage deferment vs. forbearance

I'm not sure if this is a good place to post, but if there is a better place please let me know.

Basically, when all of this crap started I had called my mortgage servicer (Freedom Mortgage) to inquire about putting my mortgage on forbearance.  I was told that I could begin forbearance, but after 90 days I would be required to make up those missed payments as a lump sum...essentially requiring me to pay the equivalent of 4 months of payments all at once (3 missed payments + 1 month payment that is normally due).  That's obviously stupid and doesn't help anyone.  It would make significantly more sense to put the payments onto the end of the mortgage - essentially extending the term.

Then I came across this article today &lt;[https://www.npr.org/2020/04/07/828011892/many-struggling-homeowners-not-getting-the-mortgage-relief-u-s-promised](https://www.npr.org/2020/04/07/828011892/many-struggling-homeowners-not-getting-the-mortgage-relief-u-s-promised)\&gt; which calls out Freedom Mortgage for being misleading and creating more hurdles than are required.  I called them today to ask about putting the payments onto the end of the mortgage instead of the lump sum and was told they could not do that, and again the excuse was federal regulations.

Does anyone have any information that can help give clarity on the situation, and assuming Freedom Mortgage is in fact screwing over their customers is there a way to force their hand or at least report their wrong doing (if it is in fact wrong)?

NOTE: I am aware that interest wouldn't stop during the forbearance period, even if the payments are tacked onto the mortgage at the end of the term.

knbner,poqwrslr,"Start 529 or no with effect on student loans

I tried to search and struggled to really find a clear answer, so hoping I can at least get some clarity to help with my research.

Basically, we (31M and 32F...married) have a 2.5yo daughter and have been waiting to start her college savings until my student loans were paid off.  We now have the cash to be able to pay off my student loans but have decided that it is worth it to pay less than $2000 in interest over 3.5 years and keep the $32,000 in cash and use in other ways.  As a result of this, we feel ready to start saving for our daughter's future college costs.

My question is whether it will make sense knowing that a 529 impacts financial aid eligibility?  Therefore is there a better way to use this money, possibly a brokerage investment account, pay more on house, backdoor IRA, etc.? (open to suggestions here)

We are already fully funding our HSA, 401k, and Roth IRAs (just the $12k, not doing backdoor right now).  We have zero debt except my student loans and our mortgage.  I currently make approximately $140k, but good chance that prior to our daughter going to college I will decrease how much I work and as a result my income will drop as well (somewhat like a coastFIRE situation).  We also currently have $320k+ in retirement savings.

So, again, does the 529 plan make sense, even though it will decrease financial aid eligibility?

kx5bcc,poqwrslr,"Pay off student loans or hold cash?

**Short version:**

Available cash = \~$36,000...

Married: me (31M) and wife (32F, stay-at-home mother) and 2.5yo daughter...currently working with fertility to hopefully continue to grow our family

Pay off the student loans over the next few months, or ""hold"" the cash?

&amp;#x200B;

**Long version:**

I have just over $31,000 in student loans at 3.375% left (only debt other than mortgage), and have essentially $36,000 in available cash.  For quite some time my wife (32F) and I (31M) placed a major focus on paying off my student loans, and have done well bringing the total from $125,000 down to current in 4 years.  But, the pandemic got me worried so we have been hoarding cash for the past year.  (I will add that I would not pay it ALL today, only leaving us with \~$5k in emergency fund.  It would be a process throughout the year.  While the pandemic has not hit us hard financially since my job seems to be pretty secure (healthcare...), it is 100% still ongoing so want a healthy e-fund.)

The wife and I always review our finances at the end of the year, and decided to change gears somewhat by opening and funding a 529 for our 2.5yo daughter in December 2020.  We always had felt that we should pay off my student loans before saving for our daughter's education, but decided to change plans slightly in knowing that we had the cash to pay off my loans.  This was also decided since the student loans ""cost"" such a relatively small amount of interest over the remaining term of the loan.

Basically, the loan has 38 months left with minimum payments of \~$875/mo.  That will cost us a bit under $1,800 in interest over 3+ years.  I will add that the student loans stress me out.  Nothing crazy, but I do pick up pretty significant overtime because technically we don't make our budget on just my base salary.  The calculation puts us $142 short each month, but we don't give as much to our church as I would like to make up the shortcoming.  But, we also never ""fall short"" because I worked \~60 extra shifts last year for an extra \~$25k in income, so it's never really been a problem.

So, does it make sense to hold onto cash (minus the $10k we put into our daughter's 529) and just pay the minimum with such a small interest rate, or get rid of the student loans? (Note: we are already fully funding HSA, IRAs, and my work 401k.)

Bottom line, wife and I made a plan, but now I'm second guessing and strongly considering changing the 529 beneficiary to me and using it to pay down student loans and continuing to do so until they're gone in 2021.  I know this is a personal decision, I'm just hoping to get some good advice..and of course I will discuss this at length with my wife if I do think a change should be made, but generally speaking I handle the finances so she pretty much goes with my recommendations.

(Last thing...there are two upcoming expenses that I guess stress me out.  First...I am planning on purchasing a pellet smoker/grill this spring.  This may cost a bit over $2,000, but am picking up extra shifts in January and February that will more than cover that expense.  Second...as I said we are trying to grow our family.

So my daily driver has essentially bit the dust.  I won't go into every detail, but basically the car is worthless.

Secondly, I am struggling with whether I even want to accept these payments.  I've always received a bit of a refund except for 2020 taxes where we owed over $5,000.

Hi all,

I looked through the wiki and couldn't find anything... I'm trying to estimate take home pay for each paycheck. US income. 

We are a dual income household.

Partner makes over $200k. I make about $90k. I have 457 and 401k that I will put $22,500 into (each). However, I frontload the 457 so the first 6 months I take out $3750 each paycheck, then none for the last 6 months. Partner has 401k that we will put $22,500 into. Partner has one small side gig that is W2 as well (about $3k) and makes around $5k in Self-employment income. We also get around $1-2k from dividends, capital gains, interest, etc. 

No kids. Standard deduction. Health insurance is about $1800 a year pretax.

State and local taxes are about 5% for partner after deductions and 2.3% of gross income plus 5% for me after deductions.

Would love some help estimating paychecks for January! I get paid monthly and partner semi-monthly.

Thank you for any help!

however, i am planning on moving jobs. but i know my FSA/health insurance acc will show up as $1800 available, meaning i dont necessarily have to wait until the money is actually in the FSA before using it. but can use $1800 still.

but in my case, since ill be moving jobs, what exactly happens here?

1. the money thats already in the FSA account up to YTD. i think its been 5? paychecks so far? so about $200 in my FSA acc.

13f06h6,QandGone,"Can someone help me understand how Health Insurance works and how to make sure I dont get screwed? (USA)

I am in the USA. I understand the fundamentals of health insurances. such as deductibles, copay, max OOP, etc.

Also that some procedures (Usually preventative ones) are  sometimes 100% covered by health insurance even before deductibles are met. (sometimes might have a small copay,)

and that once you meet your deductible, you pay coinsurance % only and insurance covers the rest. once you hit max OOP, you no longer pay for anything and health insurance covers it all.

in general, this also applies when you use out of network providers as well, its just the values it covers are usually higher (i.e. higher copay, or coinsurance, etc) but once you meet your max OOP, health insurance will cover out of network providers as well (i believe?)

but i keep reading horror stories of it being much more complicated than that on /r/pf.

the reason why i ask this is because i have a colonoscopy coming up. it is not preventative, but will be diagnostics. so i fully expect it to have to pay myself. but im assuming it will go towards my deductible.

in addition, i will be getting anesthesia. so i want to make sure that falls under my insurance and is either covered fully, or i dont end up paying thousands for it because the anesthesia specific individual that comes, or even the whole company that provides the anesthesia service for my doctors clinic, is an out of network provider.

i also am worried because i would like to get a endoscopy at the same time. meaning I want to ensure this falls under my insurance. my deductible is only $2k. and max OOP i believe was like $2.5k.

So for once, this is a story regarding my medical bill being much lower than I thought it would be.

This year, i knew i would need to get a colonoscopy (which i got one). doing my research, this would fall under diagnostic purposes. and in fact, there was a polyp also found and removed.

so for sure this is is not preventative, but diagnostics. Which insurance does not cover.

Doing my research, i found that a colonoscopy is in the $1.5k to $1.8k range. However, I got my bill from the clinic. and it went from $1400 to about $500 (all including everything i believe. including anesthesia i think?...). Insurance covered about $1k.

Hi

My employer does not have a 401k since we are a start up in tech.  While the salary and stock benefit is nice, I don't really have any retirement accounts except for roughly $12k in a Roth IRA from my past job.  

So should I choose a high deductible plan to get the HSA for retirement purposes?  I've been reading up on the account and the benefits but I know I will likely need surgery within 12 months.  I had an annual physical with my doctor and she said I may need surgery to fix a cosmetic deformity on my foot.

q7o3vk,QuitLeagueofLeg,"Invest my IRA in Stock since I have no 401k, pension, or profit sharing plan?

Hi,

I don't have a 401k at my new job and I plan to stay here at my employer for a while.  I am going to create a IRA since my income phases me out from creating a ROTH ira.

Since I'm limited to only contributing a mere $6,000 to my retirement each year,  I was considering purchasing stock in companies that I understand pretty well give my work experience.  This does not violate any policies at my employer.

My rationale is I want to try to get the highest return ideally (while I'm young) rather than just choosing a target date fund with bonds and international stocks since I'm limited to a $6k contribution each year.  Later in life, I can just switch to a target date fund when I'm older.    I think I may create an HSA as well but that is only an additional $3k and the purpose of the funds would be restricted to certain uses.

Your thoughts?  Is this not a good idea and I'm better off just sticking to a target date fund even when I'm still in my 20s?  Would I be better off just sticking to an index fund and then maybe making a side bet here and there with just 5-10% of my portfolio?   I would plan to stick to this strategy for maybe 10-20 years and then switch to a TDF.  Either that or I change employers and then they will have a 401k or some sort of profit sharing plan or pension that I can receive.

Hey everyone,

I am finally close to paying off my student loans and have a positive net worth. I ended my lease and am living with my parents for a bit until I have to move back to the City once this Covid stuff is over with.

I work in the medical field and in a way I find it so amusing that a lot of people are paying their bills with a HSA card.

I just feel like I have a good understanding that even with an HSA, I should still use my income to pay for all health related things while keeping a very good record of everything because.....in retirement you can cash in on EVERYTHING you spent and get reimbursed ON TOP of all your compounded growth?

I just refinanced my mortgage to a 15-year fixed rate conventional at 2.625% (2.723% APR).

o7rdwe,Rainpia,"Which account should I withdraw from first for big purchase?

Hi, I budget in a way  where I try to keep most of my assets invested (apart from my emergency fund in a HYSA which I wouldn't want to use in this scenario) to maximize passive growth.

What order should I pull from these accounts for a big purchase in order to maintain maximum benefits of growth, tax-advantages, etc. of these accounts?

1. **Taxable Investment Account** \- Sell some long term-investments which would incur long-term capital gains tax.

3. **Roth IRA** \- Withdraw some of my contributions which would also be tax free since contributions have already been taxed. (Doubt this option would be prioritized, but just throwing it in there).

I think the real question is between options 1 and 2.

pulbtz,Rainpia,"HSA Loophole Question

My understanding of the ""loophole"": 

If you have an HSA eligible medical expense that you can afford to pay out of pocket, pay it out of pocket and save the receipts. An HSA doesn't care when you withdraw for the eligible expense, so this lets your HSA funds stay invested longer for more potential growth. This will allow your HSA to grow to fund higher medical expenses down the road which are more likely to occur with older age.

Question:

* Why do you need to save your receipts now? Won't you be able to withdraw against the higher medical expense itself when it occurs down the road? Why would you need more than that big medical bill when it occurs?
* Or is the loophole meant to let you withdraw for non-medical related expenses using saved HSA eligible receipts?

This is something new I learned today and I wanted to check with you guys to see if my understanding is correct and I'm taking the right steps to take advantage of a 529 plan. TIA!

Under the SECURE act, student loans have been added as a qualified expense that can be paid for by 529 plans as of 2019. There is a lifetime limit of $10,000 from a 529 plan that can be used without any penalties or tax consequences to repay the beneficiary's student loans, including federal and most private loans.The Virginia529 (VA is the state my spouse and I currently reside) allows state residents to deduct annual contributions up to a limit of $4,000 for taxpayers filing married/jointly.

With the current COVID-19 forbearance, we've been saving to make a bulk payment towards my wife's federal student loan debt once forbearance ends in Jan. Based on the info above, are there any issues with the following plan to take advantage of a 529?

1. Open a Virginia529 with wife as beneficiary in Dec 2021 and contribute $4,000.
2. Contribute an additional $4,000 in Jan 2022.
3. Towards the end of Jan (before forbearance ends) pay off highest interest student loans by withdrawing $8,000 from Virginia529 and using any remaining savings reserved for student loans.
4. Make regular payments in 2022.
5. Contribute additional $2,000 to 529 in Jan 2023 and withdraw to make an additional $2,000 payment in 2023 to complete $10,000 lifetime limit.

This would effectively allow me to take the maximum annual 529 state tax deductions in 2021, 2022, and 2023. We've been saving to make a bulk student loan payment anyway, might as well route $10,000 of it through a 529 to take advance of the state tax deductions right?

Also, one caveat to this is that plan holders cannot claim any student loan interest deductions paid with a 529.

I have no financial background, I'm just trying to understand different concepts I've seen to help decide debt repayment and investing order/priorities. I've seen both the 'US 10-Year Treasury Note Yield' and the 'Prime Rate' used to determine whether interest on a debt is considered high/moderate/low. For example:

**Current US 10-Year Treasury Note Yield as of today is 2.302%:**

1. High interest debt is 5% or more above the current yield, so anything above 7.302%
2. Moderate interest debt is 3% or more above the current yield, so anything above 5.302% but less than 7.302%
3. Low interest debt is less than 3% above the current yield, so anything below 5.302%

\-or-

**Current Prime Rate as of today is 3.50%:**

1. High interest debt is double the prime rate and above, so anything above 7.00%
2. Moderate interest debt is above the prime rate, so anything above 3.50% but less than 7.00%
3. Low interest debt is less than the prime rate, so anything below 3.50%

There are similarities to these concepts, but as you can see, it starts to differ as we get into the identification of moderate and low interest debt. Does using one benchmark over the other make more sense from a financial perspective? Would love to hear your thoughts.

About ten years ago when I really got interested in money and investments, I was asking friends and looking at message boards for investment advice. Everyone told me to put most of my money in ETFs that had a higher than normal dividend yield. These ETFs were recommended and I was told they would give me a higher total return than a standard total stock market fund, like VTI, SPTM, or ITOT.

So I invested over the last ten years much of the money I have in my Vanguard Brokerage Accounts in these high dividend ETFs and now after finding the Portfolio Visualizer website have determined I have lost nearly $100K in stock market gains by buying these high dividend ETFs-listed below- instead of a simple total stock market fund.

ogsg45,rarelywearamask,"People say that they live on the stock dividends and don't touch the principal--- really?

On nearly every investment board on the Internet are tons of people who swear that they have the perfect plan for a guaranteed funded retirement.  Here is their foolproof plan:

**They live on the stock dividends and don't touch the principal.**

Is this genius or just ill-informed?  I vote ill-informed because if you spend the dividends paid by the stock investments you are in fact spending the principal.  People assume that stock dividends are like bank interest where you are getting extra money every month/quarter above and beyond the value of your portfolio.  This is wrong!  Stock dividends are not like getting bank account interest.

**When a dividend is paid, the cash paid to each shareholder is deducted from the cash held by the company. This reduces the book value of the company when it pays you a dividend. Therefore, the value of the company is reduced every time it pays a dividend. In addition, when a dividend is paid, the stock price of the company is automatically adjusted by the stock market by the amount of the dividend. Therefore, in our example, if the company pays a $1.00/share dividend, then the stock price would automatically adjust from $100/share to $99/share after the dividend is paid. The same would drop would occur in the book value of the company.** 

So when you withdraw the dividend payment from your account and spend it, the value of your portfolio is down the same as if you did a scheduled withdrawal of the same percentage as the dividend payment.

oi1buu,rarelywearamask,"Invest your entire Social Check in the stock market? Better to start at age 62 or 70?

A friend of mine- who retired early at age 60- is well off and does not really need the money from Social Security.  So he plans to apply for SS and invest each monthly check in the stock and bond market and give the proceeds to his children at his death.  The question is should he start collecting at age 62 or wait till 70 and get the largest monthly check.

For the sake of argument, he said he plans to live to age 90.  (just a guess of course but a common age for someone who is healthy and privileged.)  So if he collected Social Security at age 62 he would collect 336 smaller monthly checks for 28 years.  If he waited until 70 to collect SS he would collect 240 larger monthly checks for 20 years.

I found this is a fascinating math and investing question.  So I did some calculations from the historical stock market records.  I used both a total stock market fund and a balanced mutual fund (Vanguard Wellington (VWELX) that has been in operation since the 1930s.

I assumed the ""collect at age 62 monthly check"" to be $2000 a month and a collect starting at age 70 check of $4000.00.  Each would increase each year for inflation.

j7mk5j,RatinSweet,"Monthly budget planning

I asked a question about RSU's last week and you all were so very helpful! Thanks for that.

I want to start off making the right decisions, so how would you say I should plan to budget my money? A few specific questions:

1. Rent: I'm shopping for 1 bedroom apartments in Silicon Valley, and they're like 2-2.5K a month for a decent place. I have an apartment with my college friends in Berkeley where 4 of us share a nice 2 bedroom apartment, each paying around $1,200, which I think is a lot more reasonable. However, it's about a 1.5 hour one way commute from Berkeley to work (fortunately, we have transportation shuttles), so I'm not sure the 1K a month savings is worth that much trouble?
2. Investing: After saving for retirement, HSA, etc, I'm wondering how much should I put into the stock market? What is a good percentage of the money left over? I've done options trading in the past, but I kind of want to just have money passively grow in the stock market.
3. Other savings: I'm not sure how much is a reasonable spend per month; should I aim to save everything after fixed expenses? Is there any reason why I should open a savings account over putting money into the stock market?
4. Monthly income: I'm normalizing my salary by 12 months, though in reality, I get less per month but a few times a year (RSU vesting and bonus time), I can expect a fair bit more. Is this a reasonable way to think about monthly income?
5. Other than health insurance, are things like dental, life, etc useful?
6. Debt: I have around 13K in subsidized federal student loans, but my company is matching my annual payment up to a certain amount, and people on my previous post mentioned that I should try to get it from 7% to a lower percentage. I think I can do that. However, I also owe my parents around 80K for 1.5 years of school (I am from out of state). How should I pay that without paying tax? I heard anything over 10K is taxable? Would it be 20K since I'm technically paying two people back?

On my paystub, I have my gross income (year to date), FIT Taxable wages (year to date), taxes,  deductions, and then net.

Iâ€™m assuming if I donâ€™t report something, this account will still get funded from both sources even though family member isnâ€™t alive.

jchyrq,riccarjo,"My life fell apart and I moved home with my parents, allowing me to save up a year's worth of rent. Now I want to make sure I'm making the smartest financial choices, what should I do?

About a year and a half ago I left my fiancee after a 7 year relationship.  Due to this, I had to move back home with my parents, but all of the sudden I had much lower living expenses with the same salary.  I ended up saving about $20k over the year and want to ultimately have enough to own a house in a few years.  

Since I hit $20k, however, I signed a lease to a house with a few friends of mine.  I don't have the greatest relationship with my parents and the house is *huge* and cheap.  So while moving out may not have been the best financial decision, it was the healthiest one for me.  I also had absolutely no furniture or things of my own moving in, so I had to spend a chunk to buy all of that as well.

Some caveats: 

1. I am severely underpaid at work and currently looking to get a new job.  I know that's the most efficient way of increasing my financial stability/savings.  Just hasn't happened yet. (Most jobs I'm interviewing for are offering 30-50% salary increases)
2. I know I can put everything I own into my student loans, but I like having liquid cash to fall on in case things fall apart again.  Plus, I really do want a house and I feel like putting everything into my student loans would push that back a few years if not more. I could be wrong.

So here's what my financial make up looks like right now:

Cash: $14,500 (Deposit, realtor fee, first month's rent, furniture, etc. cost about $5,500 total).

403b: $9,100 (No company match.  I contribute $250 a month to this)

Salary: $62,000 (I know this is low, but I'm actively working to find a new job.  I work in a nonprofit)

Student loans: $64,000 at 3.7% interest rate, I pay $650 a month towards this.  I originally had a loan with rates over 11%, refinanced it to 6% and then refinanced again to 3.7%

Car: I bought a used 2018 chevy cruze for $14,000. I financed $9k and paid $5k up front.  I pay $213 a month and will pay it off 3.5 years now.  I tried to find something cheaper, but anything cheaper required a ton of work, and leasing just feels like a waste of money.  I'm happy with this purchase.4

Credit rating: 765

I'm hoping to be able to get back to $20k by the end of the year.  However, should I invest this cash into a Vanguard?  I'm just very worried about losing this as a large emergency fund for myself.

rvxwbl,riccarjo,"Why would my landlord offer us such low rent for our apartment? Is there some financial advantage he gets, or is he just not realizing he's far below market value?

I have a rudimentary understanding of real estate and having financial assets, but no matter what way I look at this, I can't help but feel my landlord made a mistake.  The reason I'm wondering is because we would like to renew our lease, but are trying to get ahead of any rent raises.  We live in NYC, so it's quite possible.

The way I understand it is that our landlord is in his mid/late 30s and recently bought a condo.  They lived in the condo for a few years and we're the first people they're renting it out to.  I looked on a few websites and got an estimate of what the actual property is worth, and it seems almost certain that any type of mortgage worth it's salt would be what we pay, if not much more.

Say we were to hypothetically pay $1,000 in rent, each mortgage calculator I look at gives figures of $950 - $1,400 a month for the property.  Most other listings in the area go for $1,200 - $1,400 in rent.  Again, all hypothetical numbers, but the ratios are roughly accurate.

Why would our landlord do this?

1. Could it just be that they didn't know the market value?  Since they had a realtor I doubt this is the case.
2. Could they have had a hard time finding an applicant? From what I can see the listing was only up for a few days before we applied
3. They don't really want to profit off of the property and just want to keep it occupied while they live outside the city?  If so, that still doesn't explain why they wouldn't try to at least make SOME profit off of it

My parents have always struggled financially.  My dad was very conservative and wanted my mom to be a stay-at-home mom.  They ended up having 4 kids, which was more than they expected, and my dad did not make enough to support such a large family.  So my mom went back to school and ended up working a teaching job.  Then my dad got laid off from work during 2008 and didn't really get another full time job until 2017 or so.  Even then, it's a low paying hourly job. Combined, they make probably $70k before taxes.  


My dad has pretty severe OCD and anxiety, and has also had a number of health issues - so it's becoming increasingly apparent he won't be able to keep his job, and my mom is going to turn 70 this year.  

Some massive red flags for them:

1. Zero retirement savings.  They cashed all their investments in after 2008 when my dad was out of a job
2. They refinanced the house just a few years ago and restarted their 30 year mortgage.  So they'll definitely be paying it off for the rest of their lives.  The mortgage is also definitely underwater as the house is falling apart.  The only real asset is that it's a large property in a pretty expensive suburb.
3. Since the house is falling apart, they are going to have a hard time selling it (at least that's their excuse for not wanting to sell it).  They also have an oil tank in the front yard which I believe is a very costly expense for any new homeowners.  So it'll have to get taken care of before it gets sold, I guess?
4. They pay over $10k in property taxes a year (Mortgage is $1.2k, taxes are $800 a month or so)
5. My dad owes a shit ton for medical issues, so I believe they're just paying minimums on their medical debt for the rest of their lives.  I don't know how much it is.

Yesterday around 5PM I noticed a letter in my office mail that stated I had claimed for unemployment insurance.  Obviously this is fake as I am still working with my company, but they had my SSN and the correct amount of wages paid to me, but they had an old address I only used about 5 years ago.

Hello all.  First post in this community.  It's about my Capital One savings account (my only savings account).  Long time member with them, started with ING Direct.  I typically keep \~$2k in my Capital One checking and (lately) around $25k in my Capital One savings.

Been seeing everyone talk about High Yield Savings Accounts (HYSAs) lately, so I checked my account info and see I'm earning 0.1% in my Capital One checking and 0.3% in my Capital One savings.  I browsed their products to find they offer two savings accounts, a ""360 Performance Savings"" with a 0.4% APY and a ""Kids Savings Account"" with a 0.3% APY.  I guess things changed with them in the past few years and they have new products.  Looking at their CDs, 60 months is the same APY as their 360 Performance Savings account.

Why would anyone ever choose a CD with a period of 60 months or less if one can get the same APY out of their savings account (which has no minimums or fees, by the way).  I guess the only benefit would be they wouldn't be tempted to draw from it (savings account vs. CD).

Sounds like a short term move for me would be to open a 360 Performance Savings account and transfer all my savings funds from my current account to that one for the extra 0.1% APY.  Are there any other savings accounts I should be looking at instead for better APYs?

I've used Mint in the past to help categorize my spending but soon stopped bothering with it because I believe it didn't matter to track my spending.

I've always been frugal, and saving has been a priority. I started with a financial advisor a few years back and didn't really have a plan, besides to save, eventually buy a house, and retire around 55ish.

Basically I enter all my purchases from receipts (or transfer numbers from credit cards), categorize them, and do a monthly average between today and the first of the year.

I have a few thousand dollars left in federal student loans. I would probably just pay them off if it weren't for the Biden administration's continued efforts to forgive them.

That said, the administration has announced some new programs for paying back these loans--one that's intriguing me is this (quoting New York Times):

>If you can make an on-time payment, you absolutely should. But if you miss a bill or two, you wonâ€™t be penalized â€” at least not for the first year after repayment begins.  
The Biden administration has provided a yearlong â€œon-rampâ€ to help ease borrowers back into the repayment routine.

You also wonâ€™t be reported to the credit bureaus, placed in default or reported to debt collection agencies.

An obvious downside would be extra interest accrued, which is about 4-5%, but that's about the same rate as my high interest savings account, where the money would sit if not paying those monthly payments. So unless I'm misunderstanding the math, it's not hurting me either way.

My wife has been at her job for about a year, and quietly received word that she is likely to be included in the next round of layoffs, probably in the next couple weeks. She had a pretty good 401k match that we've been taking advantage of, but the vesting schedule is 0% until 2 years of service, at which point it's 100%. So at ~1 year, she's slated to forfeit it all.

The employee handbook has some guidelines around layoff severance, but 401k vesting isn't mentioned. The plan documents don't mention this scenario either. Nor does there seem to be any laws requiring that an employer's contributions become vested in the event of involuntary layoffs. (The closest thing I could find is the ""partial plan termination"" scenario, where if 20% of the workforce is laid off, apparently everyone else becomes fully vested. Honestly, I'm not sure how realistic that scenario is, as it's a major corporation that likely hasn't reached the 20% threshold.)

I've also seen mention of trying to negotiate a severance package. I guess there wouldn't be much to lose by trying, but I'm not optimistic they'd agree since we wouldn't be negotiating from a position of strength. Are there any other angles to pursue with this?

Last week my wife awoke with severe abdominal pain and we quickly headed to the Emergency Room. The pain was so severe we debated calling an ambulance, this wasn't a case of using the ER for a minor issue. While there, the doctors did several types of imaging. One of them was a CT scan.

While at the hospital, I paid our ER copay of a couple hundred dollars. The claims have just posted to our account, and one type of imaging was fully covered by our insurance. However, the CT scan was not. The claims summary shows ""No prior authorization"" and an ""Insurance pays"" amount of $0.00 and the full balance listed under ""Your Share"".

17fg7mw,rvH3Ah8zFtRX,"Making sense of term life insurance length and benefit amount

My wife and I are expecting a baby and so we're starting to shop for term life insurance. And so of course we need to determine the proper term and benefit amount. We're early/mid 30s, in good health, and make a combined $280k (split nearly 50/50) with annual bonuses up to 15% (not guaranteed, but some portion of that is likely). I've read different article and suggestions, and it seems like it can get very complicated very quickly, with many philosophies / opinions on how to do it.

For the term, I've seen that you should cover up to your retirement age, or just until the age ""where income replacement is necessary"". Are these not the same thing? For me, that would be approximately a 30 year term, but it seems like 20 year is the most common?

For the amount, I've seen suggestions of 10x to 15x your *gross* income. But aren't insurance benefits un-taxed? So why is it based on gross? And where does this rule of thumb come from? If I died *today*, my wife would be losing over $4M in expected lifetime earnings. Yet we'd be buying a policy for roughly half of that?

I've also seen methods such as ""determine your monthly expenses you need to replace, then add in remaining debt that needs to be paid off, anticipated expenses (e.g. college savings), and that's your replacement amount."" But that seems overly complicated? All those factors are real (I have a mortgage, I'll be saving for college), but those will all be covered from my salary. So what's the point in breaking all that out vs just using something based on my salary?

Additionally, they seem to be influenced by the status quo bias, as they are drawn to the most common term length of 20 years, even if it may not be the best fit for their needs. Their overconfidence is evident in their attempt to create a personalized approach, which might be overly simplistic, and in their skepticism towards established rules of thumb.

The homeowner also seems to be relying on the mortgage company's capability to handle the tax bill, showing a certain level of trust in institutions.","The homeowner exhibits a tendency to trust in established processes and institutions, while also showing a passive acceptance of the status quo, which may lead to a lack of scrutiny and oversight in their financial decision-making."
pkyrx5,rvH3Ah8zFtRX,"If I change jobs and receive the same insurance coverage through the new job, should the benefits reset?

Not sure if this is the right place to ask, but basically the title. At my previous company I had Aetna health, vision, and dental plans through my employer. Earlier this year I changed jobs, and have the exact same plans. However, I'm not getting clear information on whether my benefits should have reset. 

I guess there are pros and cons to it either way. If they do reset, then I lose things like progress towards my deductible or out of pocket maximum. If they don't reset, then I am not immediately eligible for certain coverage due to my prior history.","Loss Aversion, Framing Effect","The statement exhibits Loss Aversion, as the individual is weighing the pros and cons of benefits resetting, with a clear emphasis on potential losses, such as losing progress towards deductible or out-of-pocket maximum. Additionally, the Framing Effect is present, as the person frames the situation in terms of gains and losses, rather than purely objective considerations. For instance, they mention that if benefits reset, they ""lose"" progress, and if they don't reset, they are ""not immediately eligible"" for certain coverage. This framing influences their perception of the situation, highlighting potential downsides.","The user tends to make decisions based on loss aversion and framing effects, often focusing on potential losses and framing situations in a way that emphasizes gains and losses."
przq6a,rvH3Ah8zFtRX,"Started a new job 6 months ago for a significant raise, but it now seems I'm underpaid

I'm 33 and I guess you would call my current position ""mid-senior level"". The job market in my industry is very hot, and people are being pinged for new opportunities left and right. I took advantage of this earlier this year, and changed jobs for a 23% raise. My position is somewhat niche, so there aren't great salary comps available. But I was interviewing with multiple companies, and my feeling was that I ended up towards the high end of what I could expect. Some salary ranges were much lower, others were marginally higher. But I was happy with the company, position, and salary I agreed to.

Now it's 6 months later, and we're looking to build out a team that would report to me. We've started to review resumes, and one candidate asked for $10k more than I'm making now, and another asked for $50k more! And nobody in my company seemed to bat an eye at those requests. So either the market has really changed in the last 6 months, or I underestimated my worth.

Now I'm in an awkward position of considering candidates who will ask for a higher salary than I'm currently making. Is there a tactful way to address this with my boss?","Anchoring, Loss Aversion, Present Bias","The statement reveals several biases. The individual's initial satisfaction with their 23% raise and feeling of being at the high end of the salary range suggests Anchoring, as they are using their initial offer as a reference point. However, upon learning that new candidates are asking for significantly higher salaries, they are experiencing Loss Aversion, feeling underpaid and anxious about their current compensation. Additionally, Present Bias is evident as they are focused on their current situation and immediate concerns, rather than considering long-term implications or taking a more objective view of their initial salary negotiation.","The user exhibits a tendency to rely on initial reference points and react strongly to new information that challenges their current situation, indicating biases that influence their perception of value and compensation."
