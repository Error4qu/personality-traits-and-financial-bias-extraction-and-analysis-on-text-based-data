Hello! 

First-time poster here. I (25m) have about $25,000 saved that I would like to invest. I already have a robust emergency fund and no debt whatsoever. Would you suggest putting that all into a target date fund (probably VTTSX), or should I consider creating a three-fund or four-fund portfolio?

But what about the fourth fund? Maybe I should consider VNQ or another REIT?

And one final question: Do you prefer ETFs or index funds?

I recently inherited a large sum of money when my uncle died.

rwhbnn,throwaway_4829890973,"In your opinion, does it make more financial sense to drive a car until the wheels fall off or trade in periodically?

Hello! Quick question for you all.

I have a 2016 Honda Civic, which I love. I got it when I was in college and it's treated me very well. It's been on a lot of road trips with me and as a result it's got about 160,000 miles on the odometer. Despite the high miles, it still runs well, and the only expenses I've incurred with it are routine upkeep (tires, brakes, fluids, etc.). And the body is still in beautiful shape.

My question is this -- does it make more financial sense to trade in periodically, or should I run my Honda until the wheels fall off? A local dealership estimates I could get around $12,000-$15,000 for it given the current state of the car market, and I could afford to level up to a newer Civic or Accord with lower miles. On the other hand, I could probably continue to drive this car for another five years (or more), though the trade-in value by then will probably be next to nothing.

So, which scenario makes more financial sense? Trade in and bank a good chunk of money to put toward a newer model with fewer miles, or run the car until it dies, at which time I'll have to buy a new car without the benefit of being able to trade in my Civic for the cost of half the new car?

ryvmez,throwaway_4829890973,"My car was totaled and now I'm (unfortunately) in the market for a new one. Should I buy used or new, and should I finance or pay in full?

Hi!

Earlier this week, I allowed my mom to borrow my car. As it turns out, this was a big mistake. On her way home, she got into an accident and totaled the car (she was fine, thankfully). My car was a 2016 Honda Civic -- cheap to maintain, reliable, and fully paid off. Needless to say, I was really hoping not to have a car payment for the foreseeable future -- especially given the fact that I recently graduated from college and wanted to put all the money I possibly could toward a downpayment on a home and invest the rest.

But, unfortunately, I am now in the market for another car. My insurance payout will help, but my car had high miles, and therefore there's still going to be at least a $10,000 gap between the value of my old Civic and the value of a newer model (I will probably buy a Honda Insight, which is essentially a hybrid version of the Civic). Obviously, this is a terrible time to be in the market for a car, as prices have inflated at least 35% on used cars.

So, given this less-than-ideal situation, what is the most financially responsible thing to do? I can either pay for a new Honda that will likely last a decade or more, or I can pay slightly less for a used Honda that may not have been maintained properly by the previous owner and may not last as long due to previous use. Also, I can afford to pay for the car in full, but I think it may be more financially prudent to secure a low APR loan and invest the money I would otherwise be spending to pay the car off in full.

Advice would be greatly appreciated. Thank you all so much.

EDIT: I can get a 2022 Honda Insight for $26,500 or a used model for a couple thousand dollars less. Even the equivalent of what I had (2016 Honda Civic) would be around $20,000 for a model with under 50,000 miles.

Hi, everyone!

Unfortunately, my car was recently totaled by another driver, and I am now in need of another car for everyday use. However, I will likely be leaving the country for an extended period in four months, which complicates this situation. I can either buy a used car (Honda) at an inflated price, considering the current state of the used car market, or I can opt for something a bit more unconventional: I could buy a new Honda Accord, use it for a few months, and then sell it back (either to a dealership or on the private market) when it comes time to leave.

Considering the current value of used cars (which I don't imagine will go down much in only a few months), I think this may be a decent way for me to give myself a means of transportation while recouping most of my money down the road.

My 2016 Honda Civic (160,000 miles) was totaled by another driver recently, so I am unfortunately in the market for another car.

I am also factoring anticipated depreciation into my calculus.

My new insurance only allows a full mouth X-Ray once in 3 years. And since I have new insurance she wants to do a brand new X-Ray of my whole mouth again. I got a copy of my X-Rays which at this point is barely 6 months old and she is refusing to use those :| She wants to do an X-Ray again.

So I always end up wasting a crap ton of time thinking about these kinds of problems I face with budgeting money. This is a mathematical problem I think rather than a pure finance problem. I spent hours trying to solve this in excel, but I am not able to convince myself one way or another. So I thought I would finally ask for help here.

* I bought a mobile phone for 950$ on March 31st using my credit card.
* My credit card company posts my statement on April 15th.
* I have to pay off my balance by May 13th.
* Between now and May 13th, I will receive 4 paychecks, with the final paycheck being on May 13th coincidentally.
* If I pay off my balance on May 13th, I would not have to pay any interest at all. So essentially I got a 0% interest loan for 1.5 months.

Now, I make enough money that I can pay off 950$ from a single paycheck. So my question is, should I pay off 950$ using my May 13th paycheck alone or should I set aside some portion of my salary from each paycheck up until my May 13th paycheck?

I invest my surplus money into ETFs. I don't sell any of my ETFs unless I am trying to rebalance my portfolio. I have no plans to rebalance my portfolio this year.  


* 60% VOO(S&amp;P 500)
* 20% VTWO(Russell 2000)
* 20% VEU(FTSE Ex-US index)  


Alternatively, I can invest the 950$ into a money market account too for 1.5 months.

I don't think it makes much sense (but I don't know anything) to have both these accounts full of exactly the same stocks. I'd also like the accounts to have minimal effort in maintaining....that probably moves us into blue chips and index funds.

I don't know much about blue chips...just recalling the term from decades ago and meaning big companies like IBM and FAANG (? is that blue chip?).

At her age, would heavy dividend stocks make sense? O, KO, XOM ?

For index funds, I'm thinking VTI, VXUS, SCHD....I'd have these as her ROTH foundation ?","Loss Aversion, Overconfidence, Anchoring, Status Quo Bias","The statement exhibits several biases. Loss Aversion is evident as the daughter is scared of losing her money in the market, which is a common fear-driven response. The father's suggestion of investing in ""blue chips"" like IBM and FAANG, and dividend stocks like O, KO, and XOM, indicates Anchoring, as he is relying on familiar, well-known companies rather than exploring a broader range of investment options. Additionally, his consideration of these specific stocks and index funds like VTI, VXUS, and SCHD, without much knowledge of their details, shows Overconfidence in his own abilities. The desire to set up the accounts with minimal effort and maintain the status quo suggests Status Quo Bias.","The user exhibits a biasing behavior characterized by a cautious and conservative approach to investing, driven by a desire to minimize losses and effort, while also displaying overconfidence in their limited knowledge of specific stocks and investment products."
12opcnl,tony_boxacannoli,"Quicken alternative ?

I've been using Quicken forever...my current edition is 2009 ðŸ˜¯...it still works. 

Having just bought a new computer...and not remembering where I put the Q2009 disc...it seems Quicken has gone the way of everyone else and it is now a subscription based service. 
Obviously, that conflicts with my cheap ways.

Any alternatives to Quicken?","Status Quo Bias, Sunk Cost Fallacy","The user's statement reveals a strong attachment to their current financial management tool, Quicken, simply because they have been using it ""forever."" This indicates a Status Quo Bias, as they are resistant to change and prefer to stick with what they know, even if it's outdated. Additionally, the user's mention of having used Quicken since 2009 and it ""still working"" suggests a Sunk Cost Fallacy, as they are factoring in past investments (time and possibly money) into their decision, rather than focusing on the current needs and potential benefits of alternative solutions.",The user exhibits a tendency to cling to familiar financial tools and services due to a combination of comfort with the status quo and a reluctance to abandon past investments.
