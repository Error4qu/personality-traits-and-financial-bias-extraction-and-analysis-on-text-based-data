125jwj1,jaytea86,"Interest rates may have put a home out of our reach for now, where to go from here?

Income $35k a year. Household is me and my disabled wife, no kids. $40k in savings. Absolutely no debt. We own a 1967 mobile home that probably isn't worth 5 figures. Lot rent is $550. We own our 2007 vehicle outright and may only have a couple of years left if we're lucky. 6% of my income is going into my 401k.

The plan for this year was to buy a home, we've been accepted into a land trust program that allows low income people like ourselves get into the housing market by selling the homes at a reduced price while maintaining ownership of the land. When you sell the house, you sell it for a reduced price to ""pay it forwards"".

However with the sharp raise in interest rates, even these homes are barely within our budget, so for now we're staying put and continuing to save while I work on becoming a citizen (currently legal resident), this has to be done before we can get a mortgage.

We've been approved for a loan amount of $123k @ 7.375% (as of November of last year) keeping the total monthly payment at or below $1100 with taxes and insurance. Although we live well below our means and would want to keep that in the range of $800-$900 that would put us at a home for around $100k which isn't really a thing right now.

In the meantime, I don't know what to do with money that's just sat earning $100 a month. I 100% won't need any of the money for the next 3 months, but I wouldn't want to lock up all of it for any longer than that. I'm open to locking some of that money up for a longer period of time, maybe on a annual basis, but would want to make sure that we had enough to jump on a home if the right one showed up.

I been a little foolish with risky investments and am ashamed that I've lost $2000 doing that. So it's time to get serious with no or very low risk investments.

Right now I can lock up about $30k for a few months, $10k-$15k I could lock up for a year.

Thanks for taking the time!

162izop,jaytea86,"MiL has just realized she'll never be able to retire. Is it too late for her or is there some hope?

Visiting the MiL (61) today and she was all excited that she'll be able to apply for retirement benefits in November. While I was there I looked up some information and it seems that she'll only get $680 a month and would only be able to earn up to $17k a year and then SS will start dropping that amount.

She earns $14.80-$17 an hour depending what type of work she's doing at her place of employment. But essentially her biweekly paycheck comes in around $1450 net. She lives paycheck to paycheck, so the idea that she would be able to live with anything less than this is impossible.

She did look into section 8 however they base what you pay at 30% of your income which is about what she's already paying for her apartment.

She's massively in debt, somewhere between $20k-$40k. Half is medical the rest is a car loan and credit cards. She's applied for bankruptcy which she expects to take care of everything but her car loan ($13k left on it at 4.7%).

She's thought about selling the car and buying something cheaper. But I'm pretty sure what's left on the loan is more than what the car is worth so she'd still owe and not have anything to buy a new car. It also seems pointless to me because a $3k-$5k car is going to break down at some point and she'll have no money to fix it. She must have a reliable car for her job as it's not on a bus route and she is also obese and in poor health.

The plan I have set out for her is to take $250 out of every paycheck and put it in a roth IRA. That would max it out every year. Doing this would mean by the time she reaches 67 she'll be able to take full retirement benefits in SSI of $1250 and will have contributed $33k to her roth ira which would hopefully be around $45k by the time she would need to draw from it.

She might not be able to fully retire at 67, but maybe at least cut back on working 50 hours a week.

17qhz0k,jaytea86,"Stopping all 401k contributions and maxing out Roth IRA and HSA. Am I doing the right thing?

I'm 36 and was contributing 6% of my $35k income into a 401k. This year for the first time I maxed out a Roth IRA after learning about them. My employer doesn't match any 401k contributions.

My understanding is that a Roth IRA takes priority over a 401k because you'll be able to withdraw all the money (including money made through investing) tax free. 

I've recently switched to full time and am now earning $45k. I did this primarily to get health insurance as the state won't cover me anymore because my income is too high.

With the insurance came a HSA. I plan to max it out in the last 3-4 paychecks of this year. This will leave my paycheck decimated, but that's ok, I have money to cover me till the end of the year.

I plan on using my HSA as an investment account, and I intend never to touch the money until I retire.

If I put $3500 into my Roth IRA and $3,850 into my HSA, that's $7,350 a year.

This works out to be about 15% our household income between me and my wife (she earns $500 a month on SSdI).

We're behind on retirement I believe. 401k has $7.5k in it and $3500 in my Roth IRA.

At the very start of next year, I'll have the same in the 401k, but double in the Roth IRA, and a 1 year maxed out HSA. \~$17k

Is 15% going forwards enough to retire in my mid 60s comfortably? Or should I try and push that higher? If so what kind of % should I be shooting for?

With a maxed out HSA and Roth IRA, Should I start contributing to my 401k if I need to increase that %? Or should I have my wife open a Roth IRA? Can she even do that with SSdI income? I'm not sure it's considered ""earned income""?

Any other advice is welcome.

I'm new to HSA, but my understanding is that its use is to save for medical expenses tax free, and then to spend them on medical expenses also tax free. However, you can pay cash for medical stuff and then save your paperwork for decades and use receipts to draw the money out tax free whenever you want (for me, retirement).

18rz04d,jaytea86,"Can I change the financial institution where my HSA is held?

For the first time in my life I have insurance through my employer, before then I was getting it through the state.

It came with a HSA which I maxed out in my last 3 paychecks of the year.

I wanted to invest all of it on a target date fund but Optum Bank requires $2k to remain outside of my investment accounts. I'm also having lots of issues with Optum, dollar amounts can differ when I log in (for example they're saying my ""total funds"" are $2.6k, then tell me my contributions for the year are $3850 with $575 invested), pretty sure that was different an hour ago when I logged in, but either way, math.

Also, I have it set so that when the threshold of $2k is activated, the rest is sent to my mutual funds which isn't happening.

But mainly the $2k sat doing nothing bothers me.

kyf0zn,jaytea86,"I have just been gifted $8k and will be gifted another $8k in a few months. I'm in a low income household, how should I handle this?

Financially 2020 was actually one of the best years me (35m) and my wife (32F) have had. The small amount of money I had in crypto currency has now just hit 4 figures, all the stimuli went straight into savings accounts to build a more substantial emergency fund, and I also got a new job which increased our income to about $30k a year.

I work part time, about 33 hours a week. This is because my wife is disabled and that extra day off a week helps me handle her needs and stops me from getting burnt out. Because of this I'm very efficient with money. We squeeze as much as we can out of credit card rewards and have money in some niche high interest accounts. The rest is in a 0.5% interest savings account.

My wife receives social security income and we're both on state (MN) medical because of our low income.

We own a crappy mobile home, so no mortgage, but pay $450 to rent the land it's sat on. It wouldn't be cost effective to move it.

$8k showed up in my account yesterday. After much confusion I spoke to my Dad who lives in another country and turns out he sold a property I lived in as a kid and wanted to send me and my brother $16k each, but for tax reasons he's going to send the rest after April (which is when the new tax year starts in his home country).

So I'm a little lost here. The first thing is, what should I do with the money? Our main goal in life is to actually have a house, and to stop paying to rent land for the rest of our lives. However, with our low income, I feel like we would need a substantial amount of money to put down on the house right away to keep the mortgage low so we could afford it, and to even get one at all with just earning $30k a year. If this is the case, what should I do with the money I have now, and additional money I'll save until it's time to buy a home?

The second things is, currently we now have over $20k between our savings and checking account, which is almost 5 times more than what we had at the start of year when we last declared our assets for the annual reviews for both our medial and her SSI. How likely is it that we'll lose all 3 of those things? Obviously no one here will be able to answer exactly, and this is something I'll have to deal with when it comes to it, but it would be nice to have a heads up so I can start thinking about alternatives.

Lastly, taxes. Will have have to pay taxes on these to $8k gifts? Do I need to declare this money at all?

Right off the bat I will say I've posted numerous times in PF in the last few weeks, so if people reading this are reading the same facts, figures and story I apologize and appreciate your time.

13 years ago when me and my wife got married she lost a lot of assistance. Food stamps and supplementary security income were the two biggies, this was because I had money in the bank, a small emergency fund is enough make you ineligible for almost all these assistance programs. Because she was working at the time (now made redundant), she was able to receive SSDI which she will be eligible to receive for the rest of her life regardless of our assets.

I work 32 hours at a rate of pay that would make Bernie Sanders content. My wife is disabled and cannot work a traditional job (if she could find a job that would suit her needs she could do a few hours a week, that's a WIP). I work 4 days a week so I can tend to her needs and not get burnt out. She gets enough SSDI so that our income is right at $30k.

We have about 25k over stocks, savings and an emergency fund etc. We are currently saving for a home.

It's become a little frustrating as the years ago by. Seeing our peers in much better financial situations than us, generally because they have a kid. It seems if you have a kid you get huge chucks of money back come tax time and other forms of assistance. And the couples that are childless even better still with them having dual incomes.

However, with a disabled adult in the house, that doesn't seem to mean anything. I can't even get my wife a free bus pass when vets can ride for free.

I work at a place that accepts food stamps and I see on the receipt how much money they have on their card and seeing hundreds of dollars on there and seeing them drive away in a 5 figure vehicle is really demoralizing.

Or lot rent went up substantially this year. And with child tax credits meaning people with kids may be getting even more of an income, I'm worried we're going to get left in the dust with raising cost of living, and it'll make it harder and harder to get our own home.

My question and reason for posting is, is there some assistance, programs or tax credits that I'm potentially missing out on for a family of two (one of whom can't work due to a disability), low income with some assets?

Hope everybody is doing great. I am feeling overwhelmed looking for information about how can I take care of a money that me and my wife received in a settlement. I have to be honest that I am really bad with investing and understanding everything involved in this environment. I have received some advices but I can't get the picture of what are the steps in doing this properly to get retirement early. 

I am 36 my wife is 31. Making 50k annually, no debts, renting a house with two kids. My employer is paying my 401k. We have 240k from a settlement and from that money I started investing in stocks. I have planned to open some emergency funds accounts and a house down payment account. The rest of the money will be for investing with the plan for retirement early, probably in 20 years. 21k will be in 6 month emergency fund account and we are not going to touch that money. 3k in another emergency fund if something occur and 25k for a house down payment and probably 15k for medical expenses if something happens. We will have 176k left for investing. We don't have to pay taxes of that money, thanks God.

I have been reading here and there a little bit but honestly I feel like if is more complicated than in reality is. But some of the suggestions that I have received are to open an Roth IRA, open a Brokerage account and put more money into the 401k. The 50k annually is just enough for the living expenses and I can't put more into the account. Just I want to use the settlement money wisely and let it growing over the time.  

My question is how can I do the investment. What are the steps to do this, the sequence or order in opening each one. Can we Open the Brokerage account first with 176k in 1 to 3 index funds and then, pull out the annual contribution for the Roth IRA annually? Or do we have to do the opposite?. How we are going to pay the taxes if we do this?. I know that for the Roth we have to pay taxes over the contribution. But if we take money out of the brokerage account, do we have to pay taxes over the gains, and then, pay more taxes when we add the funds to the Roth IRA?. Or just opening a brokerage account with  ETFs or index funds with 176k and let it grow maybe adding a couple of hundreds throughout the year?.

omgxac,jbpr77,"Roth IRA or brokerage account: which one is the best for this situation

Hello there,

I was looking for information about what is the best option to invest a settlement money. I wasn't considering opening a Roth IRA account because I would like to have the option to access the money before 59 1/2. During the searching process I have been feeling  paralysis analysis, but is time to do something to take the money out of the saving account. I thought to invest the money in a property or something like that but in my area the market is unbelievably crazy and unaccessible unless someone millionaire.  Finally I have decided that would be a great idea if I open 2 Roth IRA accounts one for my wife and another one for me. This is the breakdown of our position:

37 years old income around 55k annually before taxes. Employer providing a 401k with 11.5% contribution.

I have 230k in a savings account and 11k in a brokerage account. Of this amount of money 61k would be an emergency fund including a house down payment. For this amount I am considering to open a HYSA or a safety net account with Betterment because there is less risk. Then,  180k is going to be available for investment. I had the idea to invest all of the money in a brokerage account. However, I have read that the Roth IRA is a good option because I don't have to pay taxes over that amount of money. Here is where I want to receive any advice or recommendations in how to manage this amount of money and where it should be.

I want to be hands off because of the lack of time and knowledge. I think Betterment is a great option in this case and they offer tax loss harvesting and rebalancing. But their fees are .25% plus the funds fees. However, I don't know exactly if those options are really important and necessary for a Roth IRA account or a brokerage account.

Another option that I heard is a Target day fund with Fidelity. not sure what exactly is this and how works but in my understanding this works alone
 and it will be rebalanced over the time. 

A few questions that I have. 

Â°What would be the best option for me?.  Betterment, Fidelity target day fund or another ETF or Index fund?.

Â°Would be better if I take control over the account than rely on a Robo advisor or a Target day fund?.

Â°Should I select only one or two ETF like VTI or VWO or one of the Fidelity index Funds?. 

Â°How about the 3 funds portfolio?

One more thing, I promise. Let's say that I put 100k over the time in both Roth IRA accounts, and take the rest of the money (80k) into a brokerage account, would be that a good approach, or it's better if I take all the money to the Roth IRA account?. 

Â°Is there another investment vehicle other than Retirement account, brokerage account or HYSA  account that I can consider to let the money grow over the time?.

I apologize for this long tread and analysis paralysis. But I believe that all of you have the experience, expertise understanding and patience to help other people succed in the life and I really appreciate that.

Also found another article explaining an example of one person that passed away leaving an investment account with a great amount of money. That person after she or he opened the account years ago, never went back to watch it's performance nor to take care of that account. The surprise was the amount of growth the account had over the years without rebalancing, etc.

Today I did some research and found this article talking about the same theme:
 https://www.thebalance.com/the-case-against-rebalancing-your-portfolio-4160045

 I am inexpert, but in my case that I am planning to open a Roth IRA account and a brokerage account to to put a considerable amount of money, my first choice was a Fidelity Target Date fund because is a hands off and the account does rebalance in its own over the time. The fund cost is higher compared to the rest of the ETFs just because it comes with that ""feature"". 

In reality, if rebalancing is not necessary at least the first 10 or 15 years before retirement, does make sense if I have a target day fund account that does rebalance every year?. Or even If I take control over my portfolio, do I have to rebalance once a year?. How about if I set my account with some ETfs to cut the expenses and never touch it?

I know that here are a great amount of people that are professional in this matter and have a lot of knowledge. What do you think about rebalancing?.

Any information or recommendation is more than welcome. Thanks in advance! .","Confirmation Bias, Status Quo Bias, Authority Bias","The user exhibits Confirmation Bias as they have found multiple articles supporting the case against rebalancing, which seems to have reinforced their initial inclination to question the necessity of rebalancing.

osx9go,jbpr77,"Thoughts about Fidelity Freedom Index Target Day Funds

Hello there,

I have been in contact with Fidelity Investment support to build a plan to open two Roth IRA accounts, one joint taxable account and something like a safety net account. They gathered all of the information to build an Investment Strategy for me. The money destined as a safety net she recommended to no invest it if  the money is going to be used in less than 5 years. For the Roth IRA account and the taxable account she was asking some questions and how I would like to have the money managed. She recommended the Fidelity Target Day Fund 2045. Being honest I don't want to pay a high fees (1 to 1.5%) for them taking care of the account. So I was considering the Fidelity Freedom Index Target Day Fund because the fee is 0.012 for all of the accounts. I would like to invest in something with lower fees like the regular Index Funds, but with those I have to be more involved. 

I will like to know if some of you are dealing with these Freedom Index funds in your Roth IRA or regular taxable accounts. Do you recommend these funds?. How are the rate of returns in your accounts compared to anothers funds or ETFs like Vanguard US and Total Stock Market?. Or if  compared with the regular 3 funds portfolio, how those funds will work over the time?.","Loss Aversion, Framing Effect, Mental Accounting","The individual in the statement exhibits Loss Aversion as they express concern about paying high fees (1-1.5%) for actively managed accounts, indicating a desire to avoid potential losses.

10vhlnh,Jcorb,"About 9k in debt, no job and no money, what is my best bet?

So, I've got about 9k in debt across credit cards (and one loan, which I'm literally on the last payment, but I can't afford). I have *literally* no money right now. I had to use loose change to put like two gallons of fuel in my car.

Clearly, not a good situation.

Right now, I've been trying to push my card payments back to the 15th. I'm past due on them all now, but I figured it gave me a hard date to decide whatever the hell I'm doing.

To my knowledge, no late payments have been reported on my credit score yet.

A friend of mine has offered the loan me enough money to relocate to live with him, and that I could stay rent-free until I lined up work and paid my debt off. I've lived with him before, and paid them back for the help they'd offered me years ago. It would be enough to at least make *one* month's payments, giving me one more month to find work, in a much more populated area.

My alternatives, I figure, are either A) I just don't make the payments, and whatever happens, happens, or B) I try and go through the process of filing bankruptcy.

Before maxing out my credit cards, my credit was actually pretty decent, I think like 804. I'm down around 640 I think, because of the cards all being maxed out. I remember, like a decade ago, missing a single credit card payment, and it *obliterating* my credit score, which would basically make it impossible for me to ever move out until it falls off (what, like 7 years later?).

Bankruptcy... I honestly don't know anything about the process. I don't know how to initiate it, or what the repercussions are. How it affects your credit score, or for how long.

My friend wondered if I should just declare bankruptcy, and maybe *then* try and relocate to someplace with more work?

140qjnb,Jcorb,"Working remote, 80k/year, need to move in August, what makes the most financial sense for my situation?

Alright, so Iâ€™m a single 35 year-old guy. Iâ€™ve about 12k in credit card yet (I was laid off all last year), I have a car thats paid off, but really nothing beyond that. Iâ€™m currently staying with friends (I gave them a rifle that was worth some money as â€œrentâ€ through August).

So before getting into specifics, I just want to lay out my biggest fear currently; when I was laid off last year, I was living with my father and his wife. It allowed me to live very cheaply, however because he lives in a town with virtually NO jobs, it wound up hurting me, because even when I put I was willing to relocate for work, I never heard back. But when I moved back up to DC (with my friends, where I am now), I had interviews lined up within a few weeks, and started my current job in about a month.

All that is to say; my fear of living someplace inexpensive, is if I ever get laid off again, I want to live somewhere there are jobs.

Right now, my thought process is saving as much money I can through August, just making minimum payments in my cards, and then moving. I have three options that sort of jump out at me:

1. Move back to live with my father. I hate the idea, but logically makes sense. They were only charging me $400/month , and he said theyâ€™d be happy to do that again (I think my dad moreso than his wife, but we got along well enough).

2. Stay around DC. My friends (that Iâ€™m currently with) said theyâ€™re happy to let me stay, to work something out with me so I can keep setting money back or paying off debt. I feel like our personalities kind of clash, though, so the idea makes me uncomfortable. But it does alleviate the fear of living someplace there are no jobs again. Not sure what we would be able to work out, but I feel like somewhere in the ballpark of $600-800 a month would probably be reasonable for the small bedroom Iâ€™ve been â€œrentingâ€ so far.

3. Moving someplace entirely different (leads being Orlando or Honolulu). Okay, those sound kind of wild, but hear me out. Orlando would only be like 4-ish hours away from my family, which would be nice for seeing them without having to use PTO (maybe not an issue with my new work laptop on the way) or paying for travel. Plus, we used to go to the parks almost every summer for so many years, I do like the idea of being someplace they could come down to visit and us all go to the parks whenever. And it SEEMS like a major enough hub, I could probably find other digital marketing work if my current job ever fell through.

Conversely, when I think about where *I* want to live â€” where I honestly feel like I could see putting down roots, especially if I ever meet somebody â€” Iâ€™ve always felt drawn to move to Hawaii. I just never had the guts for it when I was younger (I was kind of a small-town kid, I didnâ€™t think â€œnormal peopleâ€ ever really left where they were born). Since my team are mostly located on the West coast, I donâ€™t think the time difference wouldnâ€™t be a huge factor.

Either way, Iâ€™m likely look at $1600/month rent (maybe less if I spot a good deal). Honolulu, I could possibly try finding a roommate for like 800 until I felt established enough to know where I wanted to buy.

I know thatâ€™s a lot of detail, and it might be totally trivial. But I think context is important, and deciding where to live is a pretty important decision. There are a lot of things to consider. I feel incredibly grateful to have an opportunity to put my life back together after a pretty dark year last year, and Iâ€™m just feeling a bit paralyzed about what I *should* do.","Loss Aversion, Status Quo Bias, Regret Aversion, Affect Heuristic","The individual's thought process reveals several biases.

18gruwj,Jcorb,"Just started working after 2 bad years, but missed several payments the past month, credit is under 500, what should I do?

Alright, so I think some context is warranted. I got laid off last year. I couldnâ€™t find a job for about two months, so I decided to start my own LLC. A couple months of that, I found a client and made about $3k. Then my former employer threatens legal action because of a no-compete agreement Iâ€™d signed like five years prior, so I had to stop everything. A few more months to by, I have a mental breakdown, and friends invite me to live with them near DC. I find a job after another month, then after about three months of work, that company closes the whole department.

I JUST started working again, and I feel like Iâ€™ve been running on fumes for about two years. Iâ€™m literally eating cheese and crackers for lunch. Iâ€™d been able to get by cheap just putting everything on cards, and making sure to cover the payments. But I straight up ran out of money at the end of October, and had to borrow money from a friend just to put gas in my car to make it to my job.

I just got my first (half) paycheck, and itâ€™s not enough to make all of my payments, though I should be able to cover them all end of next week.

For numbers, my new salary is $65k/year, I have about $16k in credit card debt, my car is paid off, and my friends are expecting $1k a month (they might be flexible, but theyâ€™ve already helped me out tremendously). My credit score was like 820 beginning of last year, but steadily dropped as the credit card debt went up, but recently plummeted like a rock because I couldnâ€™t make payments, and couldnâ€™t seem to get much wiggle room. So itâ€™s now sitting around 490.

My mom has floated the idea of filing a Chapter 7 bankruptcy, while two of my friends Iâ€™ve spoken to think the downsides might be too hefty to be worth it.

Right now Iâ€™m sort of feeling like, maybe I just accept that my credit score is fucked, but just continue making payments. Theyâ€™re all insane interest rates, though (one card payment was 265, and 98 of that was interest).

epkesm,Jcorb,"Planning to make additional payments starting with credit card with the highest APR, is that correct?

I'm really going all-out to try and get out of debt in the next few months. I'm kicking myself over a few stupid purchases the past couple of months (I got my own apartment, got too excited and wound up getting a couch and chair that I probably shouldn't have), and I figure it's time to really hunker-down.

Right now, I have a balance of about $1800 on one card (which is 0% interest until September, no early-payoff penalty or anything), a card with about $1500 (*VERY* high APR; I just called to request a lower interest rate, but not holding my breath, it's like 26% APR), and another card with about $200 (not sure the APR; I normally keep it totally paid off).

Just knowing my own personality, I know that when I have money sitting in my bank account, I typically become a bit more lax about spending. I feel like the best solution is to take any excess money, and immediately start throwing it at the 26% APR card, which I could probably pay off in a few months. Then immediately shift towards the $1800 card, hopefully before the interest has a chance to kick in.

I wonder, sometimes, if the advice I often receive on ""personal finance"" is now a bit dated.

For example, I don't know a single person under 50 who can reliably count on *retiring* with a company. And I don't know many who are getting by paying much less than *half* their money on housing (the only couple I do know, basically had miraculous circumstances... a kind of took advantage of an elderly lady to do so).

Yet, I'm also not quite ready to live in a camper-van and commit to being some traveling hippie.

I'm just kind of wondering, what does the modern ""preparing for the future"" look like, for those of us in our late-20's or 30's?

Obviously, paying off debt is key, no matter what your goals are. But I do question whether ""retirement"" is even in the cards anymore, or if it's better to try and build a life that's going to simply require minimal work/stress to maintain.

f1vbb4,Jcorb,"Pros and Cons to consolidating debt? Would it be beneficial in my case?

So, right now I have about $4400 in credit card debt, and $6600 on a car loan. It's not an astronomical amount by any means, but I'm getting reamed on some of those credit cards (one I'm making payments of $47/month, and like 45 of that is interest).

I've had some struggles trying to ""save up and then pay debt off in bulk"". Namely, *stuff* keeps coming up, and it's making me question my own sanity a bit (am I just being irresponsible and so I can't get ahead, or am I genuinely just having bad luck or not planning enough for atypical costs, like tires/ registration/ etc?).

So I'm wondering, if I were to consolidate all of my debt into a single payment, perhaps there would be some benefit there? Especially since it's difficult keeping track of when all these different payments come out, since the exact dates they charge seem to constantly fluctuate. That can be problematic, because my rent each month takes out nearly an entire paycheck, and I only get paid twice a month.

I dunno. Maybe it's not worth doing. Just kind of curious what the pros and cons are? And how big a loan can someone reasonably expect to take out, and are they typically low interest for any length of time (ie. many credit cards are 0% APR for the first year)?","Loss Aversion, Status Quo Bias, Mental Accounting, Present Bias","The individual is struggling with managing their debt, specifically with making payments on multiple credit cards and a car loan.

gr4qjq,Jcorb,"Next month, I will have the money to pay off all debt (besides my car loan). Am I right in holding off?

Come next month, I will have the money in the bank to pay off all my debt. Which thankfully isn't all that much now, about $4300 (my car loan is another $5600).

Now one of my debts is $1800, which is interest-free until September, which I plan to pay off in full regardless. For the rest of my debt, however, I'm debating sticking with the minimum monthly payments (which are *mostly* interest, and come out to $95/month).

Here's my thinking;

That little bit of extra cash gives me a *bit* of wiggle-room, in case ""life"" happens. A coworker of mine said during the last recession, a lot of credit card companies were cutting peoples' available credit, and given a recession seems increasingly likely, I feel like I could easily find myself in a position with no debt but also no money.

Now, on the positive side of things, I've managed to cut my spending down quite a lot. I currently bring home $4,078 a month, and I've got my spending to about $2500 a month, which is a cool $1500 a month saved. So it wouldn't take terribly long to accrue enough money to pay it off and *still* have money in the bank.

I guess my thinking is, though, that I'm effectively paying $95/month in order in exchange for *not* paying $3200 off. Things are a little uncertain with my job (I'm personally kicking ass, but I'm in one of the less-profitable departments at my company and we're transitioning into an ESOP; this pandemic could not have come at a worse time), and I guess I just like to plan for the worst.

hdw0mf,Jcorb,"MAJOR car issue, could use some advice how to handle this situation...

Earlier this month (June 5th), I ran over a short tree-stump I didn't see, and through what was described as a ""freak accident"", it managed to catch the plastic cover on the undercarriage and to a *ton* of damage to my car.

Now here's the thing; the shop gave a quote for $4.3k on repairs, but one of the parts required is a computer module that currently is not available *anywhere*, because the factory that makes it has been closed for COVID-19 and it on national backorder. I was told getting this part ""could be a few weeks, or a few *months*"".

I lose my rental car at the start of July, and Geico does not seem willing to extend my rental coverage.

Now fortunately for me, my current boss seems willing to let me work remotely until the end of July. In that time, I need to get this shit sorted out.

Now, let's talk numbers:

I currently owe about $6k on my auto loan. I just checked Kelley blue book, and it looks like my car (2013 Ford Focus) is also worth right about $6k on the low-end. The repairs quoted for my car come to $4.3k.

I have a $1k deductible, and Geico will have covered $900 in rental car fees.

I currently have $2500 in the bank (just paid off some debt, so it hasn't left me much).

Here's my current line of thinking:

Once I verify with my boss that I can work remotely through the end of July, I tell my adjuster that I'm willing to wait a few more weeks. If, by early/mid-July there is STILL no ETA on this part ever becoming available, then I will call them and demand they total my car, so that I may begin shopping for a new car.

Now here's where it gets sort of dicey:

Assuming they even go along with this, let's say they agree the car is worth $6k. Well I have a 1k deductible, so they give me 5k. But I have to pay off the auto loan, which means in addition to what Geico gives me, I *also* pay 1k to get the auto loan paid off.

That would leave me $1.5k for what I currently have. Realistically, though, by next month I would be back to $2.5k in the bank. I'm... not sure that would actually afford me a car. But if I could, then I could pay cash, and even if it only lasted me a year or two, that's about $300/mo I'd save from my current car payment.

Does this... seem like a reasonable course of action?

One alternative my step-dad suggested, is if they *do* ""total"" my car, I pay off the ""salvage"" costs. I don't rightly know how this would work, other than I would pay off the difference to my auto loan, and then just see about getting a refurbished computer part. He looked up the part, and supposedly it's fairly cheap (about $150) with a lifetime warranty.

I *think* the line of thinking here, is that I would probably come out largely the same financially (probably paying an additional $1000-1500 to cover the ""salvage"" cost from Geico), but assuming I got the repairs done myself, I could potentially still have a car and be out from the auto loan.

Of course, if Geico *isn't* willing to total my vehicle, *or* provide a rental car...

Well, I'm pretty much *fucked*, aren't I? My current rental car (the absolute cheapest in the area) is $30/day, and there isn't one anywhere near me, so it's not like I can even just ""rent it through the week"". It's all-or-nothing, and that would basically cost most of what I save. $900 a month, and if the part isn't available for 3-6 months, I would be in a real bad spot.

hsj5pn,Jcorb,"Alright, so I've had some car problems, and I have some numbers to work with. What makes the most sense?

Alright, so I had a car accident last month. My car is valued at $7300, however I have a $1000 deductible. They did $4500 in repairs already to the body and one of the computer parts, however they believe there is now some sort of issue with the transmission (unclear if it's actually the transmission, or another computer part of some kind).

So, they have decided to ""total"" my car. Since the car is valued at $7300, minus the deductible they will send me a check for $6300. I currently owe $5900 on my car loan, leaving me with $400 leftover.

Now, one alternative I asked, and the insurance adjuster just confirmed, is I can actually keep the car if I pay the salvage fee of $1600. I am currently trying to call the garage again, but they were saying the current repair of what they *think* it is might range 1700-2200 (it has to be done through Ford at this point, so I would be responsibly for the cost of towing the car I'm sure). But he also said Ford told them it founded like it could be any one of three issues, or all three. I'm unsure if the 2200 ballpark he gave me was the cost of all three potential repairs?

IN SUMMARY:

Car's value: $7300
Deductible: $1000
Car loan: $5900
Salvage fee: $1600
Potential repairs: $1700-2200(?)

Finally, I currently have $3400 in the bank. And if *necessary*, my mom has agreed to help me out by perhaps as high as $5000, although that's obviously not something I'm eager to take her up on.

Or is it worth taking the risk of paying the salvage fee of the car and paying for whatever the rest of the repairs are out-of-pocket?

EDIT:

Just got a bit more clarification from the garage. He said he contacted Ford about the error code he was getting, and *Ford* said the repairs would probably be looking at $1700-2200. The manager of the shop I was speaking with said he would call over in the morning, and press him to get a little more information, just *how* confident he felt this repair would fix the car, or what the likelihood would be of it potentially being something else.

jwjj4d,Jcorb,"I'm finally free of CREDIT CARD debt! So... how should I *actually* be using credit cards?

I know some people are like ""just cut them up"", but frankly, I'd rather give my credit card number out for online services than my *debit* card number. I have a couple of cards already, which are now paid-off, but I feel like I'm finally in a position to begin leveraging them.

For example, should I use a different credit card for each *type* of expense, to better keep track of what I'm spending where (ie. entertainment on one card, groceries on another, misc purchased on Amazon for another)? Or just stick with the one that offers the highest cash-back for *all* expenses? (I believe my AmEx is like 4% on most purchases, 2% on anything that isn't otherwise covered)

Also, I've never once paid attention to things like ""air miles"" or ""bonus points"" or anything like that. I always figured ""that's just stuff rich people pay attention to, to make themselves feel better about spending money"". But, well, maybe I ought to be paying attention to that stuff after all?

One thing that comes to mind, for example; my sister *loves* Disney, and so we try to go once every couple of years. Might it be worth getting a Disney-themed credit card (I think it's through Chase), that the bonuses you get might actually amount to something substantial?

I'd just appreciate any advice. I'm still not 100% debt-free -- I just took out a loan, so I would have some cash on-hand in case ""stuff went down"" around the election (and really, it's nice having cash in the bank, even if it's not really mine, just in case).

l9taow,Jcorb,"Unsure if I'm being complacent, if I'm in a good position, or if I need to move on...?

Alright, so I live just outside DC. I make 64k a year. I'm currently renting an apartment for 1650/month (all utilities included except cable), which is a *steal* for this area.

I love my apartment, and I have a pretty comfortable life. Problem is, I worry I'm not moving *forward*.

First off, there's really no room for growth in my career. I'm already pretty much at the top-end for what my profession can hope to make, and the company has told me before that there really isn't anywhere for me to grow upward here, save for minor raises.

I've always read that the goal for buying a house should be about three times your salary, however that is... basically impossible. I would probably be looking at 250-300k for a 3-bedroom home, roughly two hours away from my work. It gets cheaper if I'm willing to commute 3+ hours each way, but... well, *I'm not*.

As for ""Remote Working""... this is the frustrating thing; last year, I worked remotely when it became mandatory. My job can absolutely be done remotely. Problem is, our company president simply doesn't *want* people working remotely, unless the government mandates it. So as long as she remains president, remote working will NEVER be an option. And she's probably 55-60, so there's really no telling how long that could be.

The thing is, I have a pretty good lifestyle. I'm almost 33, single, and live alone. I've always had roommates, and frankly I don't know I could go back to that (barring it being a significant other). This is an expensive area in the country to live, but I can certainly afford to live here. Problem is, I'm not really *getting ahead*. I just recently consolidated my remaining debt, and it will likely be another three months to have it paid off, with very little left over (although I had to purchase a car last year when my last one was totaled, which I was able to pay cash for).

So I guess where I'm finding myself is in this position of complacency. There is no ""finding a better-paying job"". To make more money, OR to live someplace cheaper, it will mean having to find an entirely new career path, starting completely from scratch. It's difficult to explain what I do, but it's incredibly specific, and basically only exists in the DC area, and I'm already making more than most in my field.

So, I would just appreciate some advice.

Roll the dice and try to find a new career, preferably somewhere cheaper? Just continue keeping costs down and paying off debt, and re-evaluate the situation again later?

uidhia,Jcorb,"So, I'm trying to build a hypothetical budget for myself, both for if I'm employed by a company or self-employed, for the state of Hawaii... Help?!

I normally kinda-sorta enjoy building out a budget. But I feel like I'm in a bit over my head with this one. I recently got laid off, so I'm looking for employment, but also considering trying to pick up enough work on the side to live on.

I've wanted to move to Hawaii for many years now, and I recently had a conversation where someone brought up a great point; that since I'm single, and I've already gotten rid of pretty much everything I own (that was prior even to being laid off), I'm about as ""free"" to make a big change as I'm ever going to be.

So I'm trying to figure, what *exactly* would I need to make, to actually move to Hawaii, even for like 6-12 months?

There are some factors I know I can plan for. The cost of groceries looks online to consistently be about 32% higher. I imagine having a vehicle would be out of the question (until I'd lived there long enough to *know* I'm staying indefinitely), so I'd probably need an apartment in-town. Prices fluctuate pretty dramatically, but I feel pretty confident I could find a place for $1500 plus electric and/or internet (I could likely get this WAY lower, but hesitant to rent a room in someone else's house without first seeing the place/meeting them).

Now, I'm trying to also get a feel for what income tax might look like, and how much of a difference of pay I would need comparing ""working for a company"" against ""being self-employed/contracting for multiple clients"".

When I lived in DC, I felt like $65k/year was a pretty good salary; I wasn't *saving* as much as I wanted, but I also didn't need to penny-pinch either, on the rare occasion I actually *did* want to go out with friends. My knee-jerk reaction is the same lifestyle in or near Honolulu would likely be closer to $80k, but until I have a budget down, I feel like I'm flying blind, and I'm afraid I may be overlooking some kind of added costs.","Anchoring, Status Quo Bias, Present Bias","The statement exhibits several biases.

Additionally, their reluctance to consider alternative living arrangements, such as renting a room in someone else's house, suggests a Status Quo Bias, where they are favoring their current way of thinking about living arrangements. Lastly, their urgency to create a budget due to their recent layoff and desire to move to Hawaii indicates a Present Bias, where they are prioritizing short-term goals over potentially more important long-term considerations.","The user exhibits a tendency to rely on familiar reference points and current circumstances, leading to biased financial decision-making."
ummyf3,Jcorb,"This will be the first year I probably need to ""itemize"" and write-off a bunch of work-related expenses. Any advice for keeping track of things, how to find a ""tax guy"", etc?

I've pretty much just always done my taxes online. Never had any major issue, but I just got laid off at the end of March, and this next year is looking to be a big, big change for me.

For one, I have a TON of work-related expenses I'm going to have to look into making, I'm likely going to be doing side-work, I'm in the process of filing for unemployment, and I'm also considering trying to start my own business.

So... kind of a lot to juggle.

I know that if I DO go the route of starting a business or doing side work, I have to report it, I won't be compensated for that time, and I would be losing access to unemployment. Additionally, A friend if mine said that unless I have an employer that's taking taxes out for me, I should probably take the first 25% of anything I make and put it into its own bank account, solely for taxes.

I'm also curious, if it comes to me trying to do side-work/start my own business, what all I'm ABLE to write off on taxes? Since I'd be working from home, can I write off part of my rent? All of it, even (since I'm renting a room for my dad and his wife, and it's literally my office and I'm sleeping on a futon)?

A friend also suggested I ""find a tax guy"". Which I have no idea how you even BEGIN that process, or what to even look for, what questions to ask, etc?

I'd also just appreciate any sort of ""advice"" in general. Like, should I just grab a shoebox or something and start putting every single receipt into it? Maybe build an excel sheet?

y3bkbb,Jcorb,"What are your opinions on ""Condo-Hotels""? Are they actually good investments for living part-time?

Personally, I kind of like the *idea* of investing in a ""Condo-Hotel"", even though I'm totally new to the idea. I'm only a few hours from Orlando, for example, and I've often thought about moving to Orlando anyways, as it's only a few hours away from family. At the same time, though, my work is a little unstable, as I don't *totally* know I'll be able to plan for it long-term or not.

I'm currently staying with family, and I kind of like the idea of being able to live there *most* of the year, and then rent the place out either when I'm traveling, or if work *does* look like it might dry up, be able to stay with friends of family cheap and keep the place rented.

But I've also learned the hard way that just because something *sounds* nice, doesn't mean it'll actually work out like you think.

For example, if a recession hits, I imagine you would be hard-pressed to rent it out. And I know some seem more strict than others (some you can only stay a few months at a time, it seems like, although it *seems* like some you can live year-round, if you really wanted to?).

So my dad suddenly announced he's leaving this coming week without a forewarning at all. He's introverted, quiet, and has never gotten very close the almost 40 yrs I've known him. My parents have been together about 50 yrs. We're all very hurt right now and worried about my mom. She's retired with just a social security check of $1000 a month. We live in suburban DC which is costly enough as it is. Rent for a 1 or 2 bedroom runs upwards of the same price as a mortgage payment could be. My parents bought this older home 15 yrs ago for 350,000. My dad has never managed his money well and has always used credit cards and has always been in debt besides earning a salary of 150k and upwards sometimes.
