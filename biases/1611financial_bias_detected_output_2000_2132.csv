However, instead of questioning their current allocation, they are considering opening a new taxable account with a more conservative allocation (60/40). This behavior indicates Status Quo Bias, as they are maintaining their current equity-heavy stance in their retirement accounts and only considering a more conservative approach in a new account. Additionally, the fact that they are not reconsidering their current allocations and are instead adding a new account with a different strategy suggests Overconfidence in their initial investment decisions.","The user tends to maintain their existing investment decisions and avoid making significant changes, while also displaying confidence in their initial choices, indicating a bias towards the status quo and an overestimation of their investment acumen."

Thanks.","Loss Aversion, Status Quo Bias, Conservatism (not explicitly listed, but related to Risk Aversion, which is a component of Loss Aversion)","The user's inquiry about conservative bond-heavy Vanguard mutual funds, specifically those geared for capital preservation with a low risk score, suggests a strong preference for minimizing losses over maximizing gains. This emphasis on preserving capital and avoiding risk is a hallmark of Loss Aversion. Furthermore, the user's inclination towards maintaining the current state (i.e., prioritizing capital preservation) and avoiding significant changes implies a Status Quo Bias.

Next month I'll have my e-fund fully funded at my target goal, but instead of diverting that 20% into my taxable account, I was thinking about still saving 5% of my pay in cash.

The individual has achieved their emergency fund goal and has a plan to allocate excess funds to a taxable brokerage account, but is considering diverting a portion of their income to continue saving cash, despite not having a pressing reason to do so. This suggests a Status Quo Bias, as they are inclined to maintain the current allocation to cash rather than changing their strategy. Additionally, the individual's hesitation to divert the 20% into the taxable account and instead opting to save a smaller amount in cash indicates a Present Bias, prioritizing short-term liquidity over long-term growth. Mental Accounting is also present, as the individual is treating the emergency fund and taxable brokerage account as separate mental accounts, leading to a reluctance to adjust their allocation.","The user exhibits a tendency to prioritize maintaining the status quo and short-term liquidity over optimal long-term financial planning, influenced by mental accounting and present biases."
o4a6s7,fizzle63,"When calculating the ""return"" on paying a debt, shouldn't you account for the additional income tax deductions as part of the return?

So it seems the standard equation goes like, you're guaranteed a return of the interest you don't have to pay, so a loan at 2% APR would guarantee a return of 2% if paid early.  So if you could make a guaranteed 3% elsewhere, say in Treasuries, it wouldn't make sense to overpay on your 2% loan since you'd be missing out on a 3% return to chase a 2% return.  Simple enough.

Some loans, however, allow for a federal income tax deduction on interest paid.  Shouldn't that be calculated into the return on overpayment?  Wouldn't that boost the return up to 25% or so, in certain cases?  For instance, if I overpaid my student loan payment by $1,000 while in forbearance and that amount went almost fully to interest, and being under the $2,500 annual limit, that $1,000 would result in not only the amount of interest saved, but also $250 less in income tax I'd have to pay, which, even adjusted for inflation until next year, is nearly a 30% return, isn't it?

Am I calculating this wrong?","Framing Effect, Mental Accounting","The user is considering the return on paying off a debt early, and their analysis is influenced by the framing of the return as a guaranteed percentage, comparing it to alternative investments like Treasuries. They correctly identify that tax deductions on interest paid should be factored into the return calculation, which changes the framing of the return from a simple 2% to a much higher return of nearly 30%. This indicates a framing effect, as the user's perception of the return is altered by the way the information is presented. Additionally, the user is mentally accounting for the tax deduction as a separate component of the return, rather than simply considering the overall financial impact of paying off the debt early.",The user exhibits a tendency to be influenced by the framing of financial information and to mentally compartmentalize different components of a financial decision.

Uninsured motorist coverage will pay your medical expenses caused by an uninsured motorist but so will your health insurance should you not carry uninsured motorist coverage, no?","Framing Effect, Mental Accounting","The statement reflects a Framing Effect bias, as the individual frames the uninsured motorist coverage in terms of medical expenses, which are already covered by health insurance. This framing overlooks the additional benefits of uninsured motorist coverage, such as compensation for pain and suffering, lost wages, and other non-medical damages. Furthermore, Mental Accounting bias is present, as the individual seems to be treating the insurance coverages as interchangeable accounts, failing to consider the distinct purposes and benefits of each.","The user exhibits a tendency to frame complex insurance decisions in a narrow, overly simplistic manner, and to mentally account for insurance coverages as fungible, rather than distinct and complementary."

p5rdoz,fizzle63,"Do you include small cap value funds such as VSIAX in your asset allocation?

In *All About Asset Allocation*, Richard Ferri claims that a 70/30 split between a domestic broad market index and a small cap value fund can increase returns without increasing risk that much.  Of course this book was written in 2010.

The performance of the CRSP US Small Cap Value Index over the last decade (2011-2020) was nothing to write home about, however; the index underperformed both total market index and the S&amp;P 500 index.  

Ferri did somewhat predict this on page 125 of his book, stating ""This is not to say that the return premiums will be as high 30 years from now or will materialize at all.  The news is out about the former excess returns from size and style investing, and many investors have already incorporated FF [Fama and French] research into their portfolio construction.  This could cause a reduction in risk premiums.  It is impossible to know.""","Confirmation Bias, Recency Bias, Sunk Cost Fallacy, Authority Bias","The statement exhibits several biases. The author cites Richard Ferri's claim from a 2010 book to justify including small cap value funds in their asset allocation, but then selectively focuses on the underperformance of the CRSP US Small Cap Value Index over the last decade (2011-2020) to question its value. This displays Confirmation Bias, as the author cherry-picks data to confirm their pre-existing skepticism. Additionally, the author gives excessive weight to recent data, exhibiting Recency Bias. The author's mention of Ferri's book and quotes lends credibility to their argument, illustrating Authority Bias. Furthermore, the author seems reluctant to abandon the idea of including small cap value funds despite recent underperformance, possibly due to a Sunk Cost Fallacy, where they are holding onto the idea because of the ""investment"" they've made in researching and considering it.","The user exhibits a tendency to selectively seek confirming evidence, overemphasize recent data, and rely on authority opinions when making investment decisions, while also being influenced by previously invested time and research."
p6eslk,fizzle63,"Are bond funds appropriate in any portfolio in 2020-21? If not bonds, then what?

I recently read that the first question one should ask regarding the inclusion of an asset class in your portfolio is:  ""Does it return a *real*, after-inflation return?""  If not, the asset class is not appropriate for your core investment portfolio.  (And thus might be better suited for your smaller speculative portfolio along with commodities, artwork, derivatives, etc.)

So with that being said, I have my doubts that most bond funds over the last two years are returning a real return after inflation.  So does that mean that bond funds shouldn't be part of your core asset allocation at all?  But if you don't do bonds, then what?  In your 80/20 allocation, if you remove bonds, then what do you use for the other 20?  Crypto?  Cash?  Just go 100% equities and bear the risk?  I like having my 20% non-equities but hell, if that 20% isn't returning a real return I should ditch it, according to the above rule.

On a side note, do you think there will soon be actual books on asset allocation written in today's environment that would unabashedly advocate for 0% bonds for most investors regardless of age and risk tolerance?  (The only writer I know who did that prior to recently was J. Collins.)","Loss Aversion, Status Quo Bias, Anchoring, Present Bias","The statement exhibits several biases. The author's emphasis on the need for an asset class to return a ""real, after-inflation return"" to be included in the core portfolio suggests a Loss Aversion bias, as they prioritize avoiding losses (inflation-adjusted returns) over potential gains. The author also displays Status Quo Bias by questioning the inclusion of bond funds in their portfolio but struggling to find an alternative for the 20% non-equity allocation, indicating a reluctance to deviate from the current allocation. The author's consideration of replacing bonds with other assets, such as crypto or cash, and their dismissal of a 100% equity allocation, reveals an Anchoring bias, as they are anchored to the existing 80/20 allocation and hesitant to drastically adjust it. Lastly, the author's present-focused concerns about the current 20% allocation and their desire to change it if it's not returning a real return demonstrate a Present Bias, prioritizing short-term concerns over long-term goals.","The user exhibits a tendency to prioritize loss avoidance, cling to their current investment allocation, and make decisions based on short-term concerns, while struggling to consider drastic changes to their investment strategy."
p9oja3,fizzle63,"Diversification into physical investments and property?

Like investment/rental property to be specific? Even a moderately-priced single family home would take about 50% of my taxable account for down payment, costs, renovation, and reserves, no? Plus the sheer effort and time/labor. Right now the funds take zero effort, time, or dealing with other humans. About as easy money as it gets.

But the principle of diversification -- eh, I should at least look into it? Right now it's 80/20 equities/bonds with a smattering of individual stocks. No property, no crypto, no alternative investments of any kind. I sleep on a couch.

kzdur2,formalde_heidi,"Does the current 0% interest on federal student loans change the Prime Directive in any way?

This question is about how to prioritize paying off debt vs saving for retirement, considering the current circumstances around federal student loans.

My spouse and I (28 and 29) are on track to finish paying off my graduate school debt (~$100k, all federal, 6.0-7.8%) in September. The interest-free forbearance has helped immensely. 

We have an emergency fund of 6+ months' expenses, and have been stashing all of our would-be student loan payments in a HYSA. We are preparing to make a large lump-sum payment at the end of the forbearance. 

Following the prime directive flowchart, all we are doing for retirement at this point is getting the full employer match. We currently have very little saved for retirement. We had planned to start maxing out IRAs after the student debt paid is off. 

However, considering that the loans are at 0% right now, should we:

- max out our 2020 IRAs before April, thereby delaying loan payoff ~3 months?

- stay the course, payoff loans in Sept and then max 2021 IRAs (missing out on 2020 contributions)?

- decide based on how much longer (if at all) the 0% interest period is extended?

My spouse and I are new to investing and recently we each opened Fidelity Roth IRAs and maxed out 2020 contributions.

28 years old, goal retirement age is 60. I am new to investing and recently opened a new IRA, I don't have much experience with transactions. I know my questions are probably stupid but I figured it doesn't hurt to ask.

Because of the fees, I want to sell all of my SCHAX shares and buy more of my current holdings so I end up with 70% FZROX and 30% FZILX of the total balance.

Does anyone here have experience investing with Merrill Lynch?

sxdhr3,formalde_heidi,"Paying off debt shortly before applying for a mortgage - should I worry about my credit score?

**TLDR:** Should I worry about credit score dipping if paying off significant amounts of debt within only a couple months of applying for a mortgage? I'm not exactly sure if credit score impacts the interest rate, or the loan amount, or both. 

My spouse and I are hoping to buy a house this year around August, when our apartment lease ends. We both have good credit scores (760 and 775). However, we will be paying off some debt shortly before applying for a mortgage, and we are worried about it causing a significant dip in our scores so close to buying a house.

The first loan to pay off is my spouse's car loan, which is scheduled to be paid off in June. The account has been open for 5 years and the principal balance was $10k, not sure if that matters.

Additionally, I have 3 federal student loans from graduate school which have been in the pandemic forbearance since graduation and I've never paid on. We've been saving up and have enough to knock them all out in a lump sum, and we've intended to do that just before the forbearance ends (which is currently scheduled for May 1st). These loans have been open for 2-4 years and have a principal balance of ~$65k.

Our only other debts are two small student loans and my very manageable car loan. We also have one shared credit card which we use for the rewards, and pay off completely every month. 

With spouse's car loan and my student loans gone, our DTI will be under 30% including the anticipated mortgage.","Loss Aversion, Regret Aversion, Present Bias","The individual is worried about paying off significant amounts of debt shortly before applying for a mortgage, fearing a potential dip in their credit scores. This concern stems from a loss aversion mindset, as they are focused on avoiding a potential loss (a higher interest rate or lower loan amount) rather than the overall benefits of paying off debt. Additionally, regret aversion plays a role, as they are trying to avoid the regret of not having paid off debt earlier, which might impact their mortgage application. Lastly, present bias is evident, as they are prioritizing short-term concerns (credit score impact) over long-term benefits (lower debt-to-income ratio and improved financial stability).","The individual exhibits a cautious approach to financial decision-making, primarily driven by a fear of potential losses and a desire to avoid regret, which leads to a short-term focus on credit scores rather than long-term financial benefits."

I am a 23 year old earning around $80,000 pre-tax, with about $50,000 in investments. Currently, I have no loans but invest roughly $2,000 per month. This includes maxing out my Roth IRA, HSA, 401K (I only max out based on my employerâ€™s match. I understand this isnâ€™t the best investment source), and Crypto. My other earnings go to expenses. Yes, my expenses are high, long story short I have an expensive hobby that I delayed gratification for FOR YEARS, and felt like that trade-off is much worth my well-being. The thing is that I would like to get into real estate investing (REI), not only for retirement/net worth building but for passive income as well. In order to save and scale, I am planning on dropping my investments from $2,000/m to about $1,500. This would cut off my HSA ( I would rather leverage the money I have now for REI rather than utilize slow compound interest). Iâ€™m not sure if I should drop my 401K because there is a 100% match up to 3% ($2,400 employer $2,400 me) and 50% match from 3-5% ($800 employer $1,600 me), totaling $7,200 out of the potential $19,500.

Additionally, the framing of dropping the 401K contribution as a potential sacrifice for REI, despite the employer match, indicates a Framing Effect, where the individual is influenced by the way information is presented.

f2dkc3,goodfight10,"Need advice on budget and savings vs. student loans.

Hey guys,

About a year ago I posted my budget and got a swift kick into reality. Since then we really worked hard on changing our financial habits and issue. We increased our monthly income by 2k and decreased our monthly expenses by 1.5k. 

We are about 4 months in on Dave Ramseyâ€™s get out of debt plan and have reduced our debt by around 56,000. Paying about 17,000 and getting out of a car loan. 

Right now we are both not contributing to 401k or putting towards our 3 months old college fund, as of yet. We are also on such a tight budget itâ€™s starting to get exhausting. 

We are 28 years old. 

Income 2019: 206,000

Assets: ~50k in retirement. 

Home: 80-100k in equity

Emergency fund: 1000 ( as Dave recommends)

Debts:
Truck: 22,000 (Will be paid off this June)

Student loans: 86k (54k 5.6% and 31k at 3-4%)
The 31k loan minimum is 116 and will slowly creep up over the next years. 

Home: 374k (worth around 480ish)

Take home pay: 9,670

Reoccurring monthly expenses: 6,027.31

2800-2900 extra going towards debt each month. 

If we stay on this super strict budget the truck will be paid off by June and then the loans should be completely done by February 2022. Assuming, nothing goes wrong or comes up, which is nearly impossible. 

What I wanted to do was:

Pay off truck by June.

Continue paying minimums for loans for remainder of term (7 years)

Contribute 15% each to retirement and 250 a month towards 529. 

That would be: 24,624 a year for retirement and 3,000 for college 

It would leave us with 701.53 extra a month without any side hustle or OT. 

If we did that for 7 years we would have contributed:

172,368 towards retirement 

21,000 to college. 

I canâ€™t seem to find a happy medium. Dave Ramsey and his community say â€œbeans and riceâ€ be miserable and pay everything off. 2.5 years is a long time for that. 

I really want to be debt free, however, every time something little comes up and takes away from the extra debt payments it really throws me for a loop. 

I read some articles stating leave the low interest loans, etc.

Hi guys,

So, after much consideration, my wife and I came to the decision that she is going to take a leave to stay home with our son and future infant (not planning yet).

We worked really hard over the last year to reduce our debt and monthly expenses and technically we have been living off of my salary alone since June. However, we have been using her salary to frivolously spend, which will come to a halt. 

She is a teacher and will finish out the year until June and then the leave will begin. Starting today we are going to live like we started the leave today. 

We are 29 years old have 2 paid off cars, 100k in home equity, 8k in savings, 60k in retirement, and 80k in student loans. 

Come June, we will have 28k in savings. 

We will be going from a combined income of 185k to ~110-115k from only my primary job. 

After paying living expenses (like I have been doing since June without issue), contributing 6% to my 401k (canâ€™t afford to do more,if we do this) my job will contribute 7%, and contributing 250 a month to our sons 529. We will be left with 300-400 extra a month to live on. 

I already have a second gig lined up for extra side income to help build savings. She plans to tutor virtually for some extra cash too. 

I am having a hard time because we have been using her income solely to save/pay off debt/ home renovations and have had some big goals for the next 2-5 years. Obviously, we will never get this time back again with the kids and that is priceless, so now, adjusting our financial goals. 

Does anyone else have any advice? Have you any of you went to a 1 income household? Am I missing anything? I am very nervous, but I know we will always have all bills paid, like it has always been. The decreased amount of savings and extra cash flow is what is making me nervous. However, I perform well under pressure, and will find a way to bring in extra money monthly. Iâ€™m not sure if Iâ€™m asking for any specific advice or just to talk this out with anyone. Thanks in advance!

Current salary: 106,575 (made 125k in 2020, and 108k this year due to overtime).

I understand Iâ€™ll be paying NY tax, so my take home would stay the same it is now. 

Take home after health insurance, some life insurance, long term disability, and 6% to 401k (they match 7.5%) is: 2845.43

Cell: 43.92

Pet insurance: 37.93

After sale of our home and savings we will have 145,000. 

Mortgage will be between 1700-2000. Letâ€™s say 2000 on the high side with taxes and insurance. 

We expect 15k in moving expenses.

We will have an emergency fund left over of 35-60k depending on how much we put down on home.

After all monthly expenses: 

961.37

I am estimating low, that a cost of living difference would be around 250 dollars a month. Moving from 2 cars to 1, insurance from NY to TX, some utilities and food is cheaper according to the online calculator.

We have 2 paid off cars. I would sell my 2006 Camry and we would keep the 2019 vw tiguan that is paid off, so a new car would not be needed for at least 7-10 years, hopefully. This is probably the toughest decision weâ€™ve ever had to make and quite frankly, itâ€™s very scary. I want to do right for the family and our finances and future. 

Stay in NY with the hustle and bustle, both work, make great money, have a hard time ever upgrading in house (current 1300sq ft house is worth 525k). To stay around family, who we donâ€™t see that often anyway. 

Or move, get the bigger house, able to have another baby, wife stays home, family life is better, change of weather and life, but save less. Most of our savings in Ny would be geared for a new house eventually. 

Moving would decrease our overall debt about 100-120k.

Hi, a few days ago I made a post (which Iâ€™ve since deleted due to not enough information on my end) about possibly purchasing a 30k (used or new). 

A few of the responses said to do it, a few told me Iâ€™m in no position to spend that much. 

Here is a quick financial snapshot.

Married, 29 years old with combined income around 180-200k. 

Assets:

15k emergency fund. 

82k in retirement savings. (We paused for about a year to pay off debts).

~10k crypto investments. 

~2k for 18 month olds college 529

140k in home equity

Wifeâ€™s paid off car worth 23k currently. 

We have 81k in student loans. Recently refinanced around 52k of those for 700 a month for the next 5 years 

30k in federal loans on hold currently. 

Our net worth is somewhere around 200-220k. 

We both max our ROTH IRAâ€™s, I contribute 6% to a 401k and my employer contributes 7.5%. We also contribute around 500-1000 a month into crypto. Put 250 a month into our sons 529 and save around 2200-4400 in cash depending on the month. 

I usually buy used cars, drive them around and flip them for a few thousand more. Currently, donâ€™t have a car, and donâ€™t really NEED one. I work from home but really getting the itch for something new. 

Since the last post, Iâ€™ve came to the conclusion that maybe 30k for a toy is probably not justifiable at all in our situation. 

Would spending 15k-20k on a vehicle be detrimental to our future finances? I realistically could put down 5-9k on a car by next month and finance the rest. I find joy in going for drives and like to work on and take care of my cars. 

Would like to hear your opinions and also when do you find a balance on spending money on something that is going to depreciate instead of investing/saving every dollar you make? Or try to. TIA

I suppose I am looking for the OK and a specific dollar amount to go ahead and spend and not regret it financially.

o7mzw9,goodfight10,"Sell our car to pay off debt, does this make sense?

So, I have 51k in private loans at 3.26% I just refinanced at 700.25 a month. 

Have 30k in federal loans on hold currently. 

That is our only debt (my debt). 

We collectively make 190-200k

We are 29 years old and have a combined net worth of ~250k-260k. That included retirement, home equity, paid off vehicles, etc. 

We have a 1.5 year old and are planning to have another baby soon. My wife is a teacher and we want her to be able to take a few years off with the next baby. 

To do that, we would need that 700/monthly student loan payment gone, so I can continue to contribute to retirement and our sons college fund. 

Here is my plan. I have a 2003 Tahoe she has a 2019 VW. We paid 30k for the VW in December 2018. Vroom offered us 23,500 now for the truck. 

Sell the VW, buy 1 more cheap commuter car, and sit on the money until September-October. Pay off the 51k in private loans, have around 5k left. Build our emergency fund back up to 15k by November-December. Save from December-June for a nicer car for my wife and the kids. End of June comes, we will be able to live comfortably off of 1 income. Going from 185-190k to 115-125k. 

Does this sound like a good plan? Is it over kill? Truck has 32k miles, 7 year 110k warranty. But, with used car prices the way they are now, if we sell, that means we drove for 30 months at 200/month.

Hi all, 

30 years old, married with a 2 year old and planning for another. 

The plan is for my wife to stay home for 1 school year (Teacher) with our next baby so we are trying to line things up properly. 

Current income for this year: ~207k
Will go down to around: 120k for the year when she takes off (in about a year).

Federal loans: 30k one at 6% the rest less than 4%

Cash: 21k

Crypto: 22k 

529: 4k

Vehicles: 30k (paid off)

Retirement: 91k

Our plan is to pay off the 48k in June to free up 700 a month to make the monthly a bit more relaxed. At that point, weâ€™ll go down to around 10k emergency fund and will be able to continue 401k investing, funding two 529 accounts (new baby), and saving around 100-300 a month extra. We have everything budgeted from going out to car/home maintenance etc. So, the 100-300 after is including after all expenses. 

I am currently contributing 7.5% and my job contributes another 7.5% 

We have paused my wifeâ€™s retirement so we can add more to the debt this year. Then after her year off we will increase hers to 15%

After the year and my wife goes back to work we will ramp up our retirement savings and get back to normal. 

Does this sound like a good idea? Should we not pay the 48k loan off and keep all the cash in savings and pause 529 saving for the year then pay loan after she goes back to work? Iâ€™m not too fond of that option.

Hi everyone. Here is my dilemma, we are in the market for a bigger suv for our growing family and need for bigger cargo space and use out of a truck. 

We currently have a 2019 vw tiguan we bought new in 2018 for 30,500 that is now paid off. 

It has 40k miles on it and we are being offered 26,000 from vroom. 

Here is the issue: We found (and put a 250 non refundable) deposit on a 2015 Toyota 4Runner SR5 also from vroom. 

The guys in r/4Runner say the price is crazy used and just buy new. 

The price is 34k plus tax and delivery fee for a 2015 SR5 with 85k miles. Theyâ€™re giving us 26k for our vw. I would sell my 2007 Avalon to pay off the remainder 10k almost immediately. 

This truck seems to check our boxes and I like the price point. I also like that itâ€™s a Toyota and will last longer than the Volkswagen with less expensive maintenance and repairs. 

A NEW 4Runner is approaching 40k and in this market (near me, an 8k mark up). This is way beyond what I want to spend. Iâ€™m ok with spending 35k because I wonâ€™t have to go into more debt or dig more into my pockets. 

Am I wrong for being ok with spending this on a used truck? I just DONT want to spend 40k+ on a new one.

Private loans: 48,700 at 3.85% currently 293 a month

My question is, am I making the right move by paying off the 48,700 at a whole, this month? I understand the markets are down and it wouldnâ€™t be a guarantee to gain over time when paying off the debt is 100% guaranteed return of 3.8%. Iâ€™m like 99% towards paying the loan off. 

It would leave me with 17k left as an emergency fund (3 months) and I would be able to save 500-1500 a month depending on OT. (500 without OT). My wife wouldnâ€™t be working from June 2022 until September 2023 (Teacher). I will be continuing the 10% to my 401k and my employer contributes 7%. 

I keep asking this because the world keeps getting more expensive, constantly changing, and this would be one of the biggest sums of money Iâ€™ve spent at once. Also, making a big change by going down to one income. I want to make sure I am on the right path.

So, should I increase my 401k to 17% to max the 401k. Then I am going to start contributing 500 to each childâ€™s 529, totaling 1000.

OR

Keep my 401k contributions where they are and contribute 500 a month (max) to my and my wifeâ€™s separate Roth IRAâ€™s for a total of 1000 a month. 

Does it matter which way I do it? Does having a 1099 contract through my single member LLC change anything for reducing taxable income? Each year I have been making more since I started work in 2016 and not sure if the business will be scaled or not. 

Looking forward to your advice, thanks again guys!","Framing Effect, Present Bias, Mental Accounting","The user is faced with a decision between maximizing their 401k contributions or contributing to Roth IRAs, and they are framing the decision as a trade-off between current and future financial goals. The user is prioritizing short-term financial goals, such as saving for a new car and house upgrades, and is considering the impact of their 1099 contract on their taxable income. The user's focus on immediate financial needs and uncertainty about their business's future suggests present bias, as they may be undervaluing the long-term benefits of retirement savings. Additionally, the user's consideration of separate accounts for different goals (e.g., 529 plans for their children, 401k or Roth IRAs for retirement) indicates mental accounting, where they are treating different types of money as if they have distinct purposes. The framing effect is also present, as the user is presenting the decision as a binary choice between two specific options, rather than considering a broader range of possibilities.","The user exhibits a bias towards prioritizing short-term financial goals and immediate needs over long-term savings, with a tendency to mentally compartmentalize their finances into separate accounts for different purposes."

My wife and I can earn up to $1000 a year by hitting step/fitness goals daily. This is about $2000/year. Is it more tax-efficient to just have the $2000 deposited to our HSA, which reduces the amount I can deduct from my actual paycheck, since I max it out every year, or take it in the form of a Visa gift card?

I'm not sure if I'd owe taxes on the gift card payout.

I purchased an I-bond in November 2021 when the interest rates were super high, around 9%. The rates are lower now. When would be the best time to cash it out now that rates are lower?","Sunk Cost Fallacy, Present Bias, Disposition Effect","The statement reveals several biases. The Sunk Cost Fallacy is present because the investor is holding onto the I-bond purchased in 2021, possibly due to the investment already made, rather than evaluating its current value objectively. The Present Bias is evident as the investor is focused on the current lower interest rates and is considering cashing out, indicating a prioritization of short-term considerations over long-term benefits. Additionally, the Disposition Effect is likely influencing the investor's decision, as they may be hesitant to ""sell"" the I-bond at a lower rate than initially purchased, fearing a loss.","The user exhibits a biasing behavior characterized by an attachment to past investments and a short-term focus, leading to potentially suboptimal decisions based on sunk costs and current circumstances."
17m6tpm,googs185,"Evaluating if I should continue to stick with HDHP and HSA

In this hyperinflationary environment, our health insurance premiums are going up significantly with my current employer. We've been going with HSA over the past several years, even with our two young children, as we haven't had too many healthcare expenses. However, my wife and I are starting therapy together and it is costing $150/session, which is $600/month, and this changes the calculus a bit. I also may try to go to a few doctor visits for some GI issues I've been having, including possibly a naturopath. I'm wondering if the tax savings and potential for growth by investing continue to make sense for this year. 

1. The **HDHP** HSA plan is going from  $5160 to **$7600** per year in premiums for our family. $3200/$6400 individual/family deductible, $5k/10k OOP max. 10% coinsurance. $15 for generic meds. 

There are also 2 EPO plans available, one with a $0 deductible and another with a $2500 family deductible, as follows:

2.  **EPO 1: $10,500** yearly premium. $0 deductible. $4k/10k ind/family OOP max. Copays: $30 PCP/mental health visit, $50 specialist visit.    

3.   **EPO 2:  $7824** yearly premium. $1000/2500 ind/family deductible. $4.5/11.25k OOP max, 20% coinsurance. $20 PCP/mental health visits. $50 specialist visit. 

&#x200B;

I was crunching the numbers and it seems that, just with $156/session therapy 4x/month, I would pay $6400 (deductible) plus $171 coinsurance = $6571. I then would add $7632/year in premiums and subtract the $480/year that my employer contributes to my HSA to get to a yearly total of: **$13723** out of pocket for the year (and any other care before/after therapy would be subject to the 10% coinsurance up to $10k). I'd also have a larger network, the PPO plans are limited to in-network providers only.

Plan 2 above would be $30 per therapy visit x 52= $1560. I would add that to the yearly premium of $10560 to equal **$12120** out of pocket. 

Plan 3 above would be $20 per therapy visit x 52= $1040. He only bills insurance for me, so that would make us hit my yearly individual deductible of $1000 (and still have $1500 to hit for family deductible). Adding the $1040 to the yearly premium of $7824 would be **$8864** out of pocket for the year. We would have a 20% coinsurance if anything major happened and $1500 more to spend for the family until we hit our family deductible as well. There is a large $11,250 OOP family max (4.5k individual) so that would be an extra $2250 in a worst case scenario. 

Looking quickly at the numbers makes it look like **plan 3** would make the most sense, but I want to make sure that the tax savings of the HSA and potential investment growth could outweigh the $4859 difference in yearly cost between premiums and therapy visits (and not taking into account any other major medical expenses for the year).
