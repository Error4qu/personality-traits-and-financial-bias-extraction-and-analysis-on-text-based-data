Hi everyone, I'm still pretty new to personal finance and investing and could use some advice. Background on me, I'm a 27yo single dude in Santa Barbara, CA. I have a BS from UCSB and am currently making $64k/yr. Possibly getting a promotion or new job soon. My only debt is a car, which I have a $7800 loan at 6.99% on, although I have enough to pay it off, I just kinda want to hold the loan to hold cash and build credit. My expenses are relatively low, with my biggest main expense being rent at $810/mo. My risk tolerance is pretty big given my age. I'd like to be saving up for retirement as well as a house.

For the past six months or so, I have been auto-investing into the Schwab 2060 target date fund (SWYNX) with $500/mo going into my Roth IRA, and $420/mo going into my individual brokerage acct. I am trying to reevaluate if this is the best approach, or if I should be changing it up. I've hear that target date funds aren't that great, although it might make sense to keep it going for the Roth IRA. I am somewhat considering starting a robot advisor, either Schwab Intelligent Portfolio or SoFi, as both of these have $0 management fees. Schwab IP holds a good amount of its allocation in cash though, which is irritating. However, Schwab IP does do tax loss harvesting while SoFi doesn't.

As such, I am kind of considering keeping the Roth IRA auto investing in the Schwab target date fund, and having the rest of my investments going into SoFi/SIP, with maybe a bit on the side to use for picking some stocks in my Schwab individual brokerage acct. What do you all think about this, and is there a better approach I can take?

Hello everyone. 34 years old. 11th year teacher (3rd in California).

Last week, my Payroll &amp; Benefits director let me know that our district would now be offering CalSTRS Pension 2 457 (Roth option also) to our certificated staff. I realize this is not as sexy as having Fidelity, Vanguard, etc. as direct vendors, but the fees are considerably lower than our other options in the 457.

Current 457 Plan Options:
AIG Retirement Services (VALIC), AXA Equitable Life Insurance Company, National Life Group, Pacific Life, PlanMember Services, CalSTRS Pension 2 (VOYA), CalPERS 457 (VOYA)

The two lowest fee plans for 457â€™s are CalSTRS and CalPERS. Every other plan is above 0.7%, even for passive index funds, after administration fees.

Ex: CalSTRS Pension 2 457â€™s lowest fee option: Vanguard Total Stock Market Index at 0.27% Fee (0.02 Vanguard + 0.25% CalSTRS) -VS- CalPERS 457â€™s lowest fee option: State Street Russell All Cap Index Fund at 0.41% Fee.

If chosen: I would be maxing the $19,500 in the 457 account throughout the remaining 10 pay periods of 2020.

My two questions for our experienced group members here:

1) Would a 0.27-0.30% fee cause you to forget the 457 option and instead move to focusing on a taxable brokerage account?

2) Does anyone have any recommendations on my other 457 plan options? From my research, CalSTRS Pension 2 is looking like the best option of the group.

I have $122k with my previous employerâ€™s Roth 457 account.

I have just opened up a Roth 457 with my current school district in California: CalSTRS Pension 2.

Does this plan make sense:

Allow my 1,950 (February paycheck)  to deposit into the Roth 457 account with CalSTRS Pension 2. Afterwards, change my contributions to traditional 457 for the remaining 9 pay periods of 2020? 

I would allow this 1,950 to hit my Roth 457 to establish an account, afterwards I would roll my $122k from my old employerâ€™s Roth 457 into the new account with Pension 2? 

CalSTRS Pension 2 fund fees are 0.27-0.30% for the funds I want to invest in. My previous employerâ€™s plan was greater than 0.7%. I did not want to roll into a Roth IRA, because Iâ€™d lose the 457 benefits.

My Thinking: 
1) Lower fees in my current employerâ€™s plan
2) Not having multiple accounts for 457 to juggle
3) Allows me to keep the benefits of a 457 rather than rolling the $122k into a Roth IRA.

faq6w5,HistoryTeacher112940,"Taxable Brokerage Account Insights - Rookie

Already maxed out Roth IRA for 2020, and DCA my 457 and 403 for the rest of the year (automatic deductions). 

I would like to open a taxable brokerage account this coming Monday with Vanguard or Fidelity. 

I plan to invest an initial amount of $10k, and would be comfortable with a weekly amount of $150/week or $600/month.

For those of you who have a taxable brokerage account, any words of wisdom?

â€¢ What are perceived to be the â€œbestâ€ funds to obtain for a taxable brokerage? Index funds due to lower turnover? Single stocks? Single stocks w/o dividends?

â€¢ Are dividend producers too much of a capital gains liability when you do sell funds later on?

â€¢ Maybe a dumb question: Are taxes only paid when you pull money out still?

My mindset is to use this as a â€œbridgeâ€ fund in the event I retire earlier. So, not for 20+ years still.

It has only been 18 hours since we learned about this. So, looking for advice.

\----

Last night, my wifeâ€™s father called to inform us to check our sonâ€™s email inbox (set it up for family to write to him, and have him open it up later in life).

In the email it stated that my father- and mother-in-law would be giving our son a birthday gift of $1,000 x his age (Ex: 4th birthday = $4,000) up to his 18th birthday. This would total $171,000.

They asked that it be spent on funding school/college, living expenses during school, etc. Obviously, we will abide by these wishes.

My wife and I had already set up a 529 account for our son. We have invested $7,000, thus far, and have another $8,000 to DCA. However, with this change of funds, it has made me want to rethink the allocation.

Overfunding, doesnâ€™t need as much as what we think are things we are also considering.

**Options thought of:**

***1a) Continue to fund the 529 account with each birthday?***

***1b) Invest 50% into a 529 account and 50% into a CD laddering plan each year?***

***1c) Invest into a 529 his 1st - 14th birthday money (105k), and place his 15th - 18th (66k) into a CD ladder? (or some type of similar amount of years on either side)***

***2) Invest some money into a UTMA?***

***3) We never talked about this before, but this could give some flexibility to fund private school in high school. Just keeping on radar as a possibility now***

In a bit of an interesting investment situation- while working and attending community college the past year, I was able to max my Roth plus another \~$10k in savings (cash). Given that I have transferred to a 4-year school and am no longer working, I am not expecting to earn enough income from internships next year to max my ira again (aka leftover after expenses).

Iâ€™m 34, will be living with my girlfriend and potentially roommates in the new house so monthly payments will be low for me. I  make about $80k and have roughly $40k saved for retirement and no debt at all. 

So I roughly have 8-10 months that I can save more to put down on a house when I close. I am living in a friends basement very cheap and have the ability to save $4-$5k a month. 

My question is. Over these next months as I prepare to close and give my down payment on the house, how should I allocate my savings to my retirement funds and the down payment on the house? Since I am a little behind on saving for retirement should I still be maxing out my accounts? I donâ€™t have a 401k but have a Roth IRA and HSA. Or since it is a short timeline to close, is it smart to pause the retirement savings and put all my savings toward the down payment as I can reduce my PMI payments and get closer to owning 20% of the homeâ€¦ especially if markets recover by end of year and I can sell that $20k in my taxable account to hopefully have the full 20% down?

tanrwf,HoosierProud,"Iâ€™m putting in an offer on a townhome. Current owner is leasing the home to tenants who are leased until September 1. What should I do to make sure buying goes smoothly?

Live in a very hot housing market. Having lots of trouble buying as my approval amount is below the median home price and Iâ€™m a first time home buyer with less than 10% saved.

A nice townhome in an area I would love to live in just became available and me and my broker are pushing hard for it. The kicker is i would buy the house this weekend (weâ€™re already drafting out offer), and then have a tenantuntil Sept 1. The tenant is paying $70 less than what my monthly costs would be after closing. 

I understand this creates a lot of risk with the tenant but the home is listed under market value and I know this tenant situation will scare a lot of people away and give me a better chance to get the house, and I have to be flexible to get a home of this quality in this market.

My main questions are:
1) Is this even a good idea or is it too risky to consider? 
2) What sort of things can I do to ensure the tenant is reliable and wonâ€™t screw me by trashing the place or squatting or something? (Theyâ€™re paying a lot to rent the place, and their stuff is nice so I donâ€™t think theyâ€™re trashy people)

After 2 years living with friends and saving 5-10% for a house down payment in a hot market (Denver) I decided in December to try and buy. I havenâ€™t gotten close to having an offer accepted and prices and interest rates keep going up that financially Iâ€™m just wondering should I give up completely or rent for a year and try again.

If I do buy anything itâ€™ll be a cheaper starter townhome/condo. Iâ€™ll be living with my fiancÃ© and after putting $30-$40k down. Iâ€™m hoping to have monthly expenses on the home at $2,600 or less. 

We have two other options. We can rent a 1 bed apartment for $1,500ish (so $750 each) a month which we both can easily afford. Or we can live in a 2 bed with her current roommate and his boyfriend which would be a little cramped, but weâ€™d only be paying about $400 each and weâ€™d be saving a ton of money.

My fiancÃ© and I are first time home buyers in Denver. Weâ€™re having trouble competing to buy and have recently heard about the Landed down payment program that we could qualify for since sheâ€™s a teacher.

Hereâ€™s the information. https://www.landed.com/down-payment?hsCtaTracking=2f440831-c1b8-4e4c-a10c-60e6f49070ab%7C967d12ea-ec30-40df-8ac1-f2dfc28e6489

Our situation is we have about $40k saved for a down payment. In our budget weâ€™re looking at places priced $350-$450k. So roughly 5% down. As I understand the program they make their money when we sell and they take a cut of the appreciation of the house. Weâ€™re having trouble competing on offers and are thinking of doing this so we can better afford a home and compete better on offers. 

My question is, is a program like this worth it? Clear downside is we lose out on appreciation of any home and weâ€™ll eventually have to pay back their â€œloan.â€   But perks seem to be we wonâ€™t have mortgage insurance payments, our monthly payments on the house are lower, we donâ€™t pay have to pay the bank roughly 5% interest on the Landed loan amount (roughly $50-$80k) bc our mortgage is lower, and it gives us more purchasing power and flexibility to buy in this tough market. 

Are the upsides worth this? I just wonder if we do it and buy our first home will we be any better off in 3-7 years when we go to sell and buy our next home or will we really not find ourselves in a better financial situation and not have much cash we could bring for a down payment on a forever type of home.","Loss Aversion, Framing Effect, Present Bias","The individual is weighing the pros and cons of the Landed down payment program, and their analysis reveals several biases.

WEALTHFRONT RETURN ON INVESTMENT

The return on investment Wealthfront is showing me does not add up. 

I contribute 100 dollars weekly since 2018. My risk score is 7. So Iâ€™m diversified between us stocks international stocks and  bonds etc. 

My time weighted return says 10.6% All Time 
And my money weighted return says 6% All Time 

This is my all time returns not ytd or specific year. 

My contributions is 15,300 and my account value is 15,788. My all time dividends reinvested was 592 dollars. 

With the stock market back up to wear it is almost. Why is my return only 488 dollars? Even when I have 592 dollars in dividends? And how is 488 even 6% or 10% return like it says?? Iâ€™m actually losing money technically if it wasnâ€™t for my 592 in dividends keeping me afloat by 488 dollars. I look at my individual allocations and they are all up and one or 2 asset classes down slightly like -2% rest are up for lifetime view. 

Can some explain? Does this dollar cost averaging weekly have something to do with it? I thought DCA is the best way to invest since you canâ€™t time?

The user's emotional tone and immediate reaction to the perceived discrepancy suggest the influence of Affect Heuristic, where their emotions are driving their decision-making.

Like we see more and more 1 trillion dollar companies , and in the future they might go to 10 trillion or even more in 30 years.

Hey everybody right now I am concerned about health insurance and Medicaid in NY, and very unsure what will happen. 

I lost my job in 2020 and applied for Medicaid starting Jan 2021. 

Mid Jan 2021 I got hired for a good job, but I am
Not â€œeligibleâ€ for their health insurance until Mid April 2021. The health insurance here is horrible, and I am worried I will be facing penalties, or a huge bill at some point if I stay on Medicaid and opt out of their crappy health insurance. Their health ins is a $6000 deductible, and will cost a lot for any doc visit or procedure. I basically will never reach this and will be paying out of pocket a lot for routine stuff at an urgent care or PC.

Ok, let me explain what I'm trying to figure out. Let's say that I'm basically trying to find out how much money I have to save, to be able to be unemployed for 7 full years. Basically 84 total months.

My monthly bills right now are between about $2450 and $2650 per month, depending on certain fluctuating factors. So, let's say I take the bigger number $2650, and just round it up to $2700.

I basically want the 2022 buying power of $2700 for the next 84 months. Obviously, due to inflation, I will need more than just $2700 multiplied by 84 months. Now, we could say that inflation averages out to 5 percent per year. (normally I think it's closer to 3 percent, but let's be conservative. Also, because we're in such a high-inflation environment at the moment)

Now, the other thing to consider, is that I can take whatever lump sum, and put it into some sort of annuity, earning some semblance of an annual return, so that this annuity will pay me $2700 every single month (adjusted for inflation at 5 percent annually).

So, it's not a matter of taking $2700 and multiplying it by 12, then multiplying that by 1.05 every single year, and getting that grand total.

ul3tnr,IHadTacosYesterday,"Roth IRA 5 Year rule clarification wanted

I've heard conflicting information about the Roth IRA 5 year rule. The way that I understand it, is that you can withdraw contributions to a Roth IRA (without penalty), but only after those contributions have been inside the account for 5 years.

However, I've heard other people say that as long as the Roth IRA account has been open for 5 years, any contributions can be withdrawn at any time, without any penalties.

So, for example, let's say that you opened up a Roth IRA in the year 2005. You contributed 4k that year. In 2006, if you tried to withdraw your 4k contribution, you'd face a penalty, because the Roth IRA account itself is less than 5 years old.  So, you haven't passed the 5 year rule yet. But, if you tried to withdraw that 4k contribution in 2011, you'd be fine, because the account is more than 5 years old.

All of that makes sense to me. What doesn't make sense, is that future contributions to this exact account can be withdrawn without penalties, at any time, even if these contributions haven't been in the account for a full five years.

It makes way more sense to me that any contribution that you make would need to stay in the account for 5 full years before you could withdraw it without penalty.  So, if you opened a Roth IRA in 2005, and say in 2015 you contribute 6k, but it's 2017 and for some reason you really need to get that 6k back, you can just withdraw it without any penalty.

v2y2z4,IHadTacosYesterday,"I'm inheriting an IRA. Should I keep all the money in the IRA, or do something else with it?

My dad passed away awhile back, and my brothers and I are inheriting an IRA that my dad had. We went to his broker place today and had to open up an ""Inherited IRA"", and then we have to have the funds transferred from our Dads IRA to our individual inherited IRA's.

My question is, what should I do with the money once it's transferred? 

I currently have a Roth IRA, and if this was also a Roth IRA, and I could somehow combine it with my existing Roth IRA, that would be awesome. But unfortunately, this is a regular IRA.

Now, I think I could just keep this IRA and buy some stocks with the money, but the problem with that is that I will be taxed once I finally start taking money out of it in the future. If I'm making less money now, wouldn't it be better to get taxed on the money now? At least 7k of it. Because I could turn around and put that 7k into my Roth IRA as a 2022 contribution. (I've already contributed to my 2021 tax year).

Unfortunately I can only put 7k of it into my Roth IRA this year, but should I get all the money out of it anyways? Reason being, my income this year is probably going to be quite a bit lower than it will be in future years. So if it counts as income, this would probably be the year to deal with it.

I currently have a Roth IRA with Putnam Investments, but want to instead have a Roth at TD Ameritrade. I inquired about moving my existing Roth from Putnam to TD Ameritrade, but the process is very ass backwards. It takes like 60 days for it to happen, and I'd have to sell out of the dumb Putnam mutual fund that I'm in. I hate this idea, because the market is crazy volatile right now. I could sell out of my mutual fund right now, and while I'm waiting this 60 day transfer period, the market could go on an epic rally. Then, when the Roth finally transfers, the market is at a new high, and I'm getting completely screwed in the process. I know that it wouldn't likely be that dramatic, but still.

Instead, I'm thinking of just opening up a new Roth at TD Ameritrade, and putting the whole 7k into that (for tax year 2022). If the market is still really badly beaten up this January, I'd hope to add another 7k to the TD Roth in January for tax year 2023.

ygla4g,IHadTacosYesterday,"Withdrawing money from a traditional IRA creates untaxed income. Why can't this income count towards putting new $$ in a Roth?

The way I understand it, when you withdraw any money from a traditional IRA, that money basically counts as income that hasn't been taxed yet, and it needs to be taxed. Let's say that you're a retired person, you don't have any job or any normal source of income. Yet, you withdraw 10k from your traditional IRA. As far as the IRS is concerned, it's like you had a job somewhere, you were paid 10k for this job, but no taxes were taken out.

Yet, I'm pretty sure that this 10k of ""income"" doesn't count towards being allowed to contribute money to your Roth IRA. Right?

The maximum amount of money we can contribute to a Roth IRA in tax year 2023 is either $6500 or $7500, depending on your age.  But, to be able to contribute $6500 or $7500, you need to earn that much at a place of employment during that same year. Thus a retired person that doesn't have any job can't contribute anything, because they aren't earning anything.

To me, it seems somewhat unfair that if you withdrew $$$ from a traditional IRA, it counts as normal income, but you can't turn around and use that income as a qualification to add more money to your Roth, without actually having ""real"" employment.

They had a return to office Covid era benefit where they would cover people's transport charges if they come to the office. These guys sent me a W2 with 505$ as wages.

I barely used to bill the company 100$ to 120$ for traveling to the office in a month. That's like 4 to 5 months of transport charges that they claim they reimbursed me.

What should I do with this W2? Turbo tax is charging me an additional 59$ for filing New York city tax. I have been working from home in New Jersey since I left that job.

13cevn4,IndianSWE,"Am I doing the wrong thing by not buying a house.

Currently my net worth is hovering around 600K USD. I have around 120K in 401k and 470K in solid index funds like VOO, VTWO, VEU and some bond Index funds. I make around 230K a year in salary + bonus + RSUs. Plus I make around 8K in dividends every year and this amount is growing by at least a thousand each year.

I never even thought of buying a house because:

1. I am on a Visa. If in the future another Trump or even DeSantis comes to power and makes all Indians leave the US, then I would have to sell my house in a hurry along with all the other Indians leaving the country. I would have to sell my house in 60 days before leaving the country. Which would mean that I would undoubtedly lose money on my investment. So I always feared buying immovable property in the US.
2. I have been staying in the US for 7.5 years but my plan was never to permanently settle down in the US. I do plan on leaving the country permanently in the next 3 to 4 years. I have multiple houses in India. My parents have around 7 houses in India which in total add up to around 1.5 million dollars roughly. All of this were ancestral properties that were roughly acquired a decade or two after the British left India.
3. Buying and maintaining the house always sounded like a unnecessary headache to me. I have always lived in these so called ""luxury"" apartments with ""luxury"" mice and ""luxury"" cockroaches and it's much better that way than directly dealing with a landlord. I prefer renting my mice and cockroaches then owning them. :)
4. Given the fact that I was generating a steady stream of income from my investments in the forms of dividends, the difference between buying a house and renting it is not that much for me. I am getting 8,000$ in dividends annually. I used to pay 1710$ a month in rent. So the difference between the dividends and rent is 12,000$. Around 1,000$ a month. If I were to buy a house. I would at least have to pay 600$ to 800$ in property tax. 300$ in insurance. Plus I would have to pay for any repairs and maintenance out of pocket. It always felt like renting was the cheaper option. Of course recently my rent ballooned up to 2472$
5. Buying a house seemed like something married people would do. One of the biggest concerns in deciding what kind of house to buy is the quality of the school in that neighborhood. I am neither married nor do I have kids.
6. Buying a house with all of my money felt like putting all of my eggs in the same basket. Putting down 300K or 400K as down payment and borrowing 200K meant that I would have to pay interest on that amount, which again makes buying a house a more expensive option compared to renting it.
7. People who say houses will appreciate in value, my index fund investments have increased in value too. In spite of all the chaos in the market I am still 35k in profit. Till march of last year I was 100k in profit.

&#x200B;

Now I have a job offer in Austin Texas. This kind of changes a lot of things for me. I will be making around 209K in Austin. My house rent will be around 1200$.

So I am moving to Austin and I have to buy a vehicle to get to work. My plan has changed incredibly over the past few weeks.

I went from deciding to walk to office to buying a electric bike to buying a cheap used car to buying a cheap car to outright taking a 30K loan to buy Nissan Z or Toyota Supra lol.

Safe to say that I am being very indecisive.

My basic requirements are this:

1. It has to be reliable.
2. I will be disposing off this vehicle in 2 to 3 years time and I want to be able to recover as much of my investment as possible. Previously I had a 2017 Honda civic and I managed to recover all but 4,000 dollars on my investment. I had 1 accident on it. I ran it into a snow pile. I scratched it against a stone bridge. And I still managed to recover like 83.33% of my investment on that car.

Right now these are the options I am thinking of:

1. Buying a new Toyota Corolla base model. Might work out to around 24K? If I take good care of it unlike my previous car, I think I can recover 21K to 22K back?
2. Buying a 2013 Toyota Corolla with 25K miles on it from Carmax for 19,000$? Can I sell it back for 16K? 17K if I drive it for another 25K miles in 3 years time?
3. Leasing it? I don't know how this works. But for 3 years I would end up paying 10K to 12K for the lease and I would have miles limit on it. Sounds like the most horrible option of the three?

I've just started my career, and now that I'm making more money, I've started thinking about my financial future.

I currently make 40k per year in commercial real estate, and if I am able to stick with this job, I estimate that I will be able to make an additional 20k each year over the next 5 years.

I currently save 20% of my savings. So far I've paid off nearly all of my $27,500 truck with this savings (okay gas mileage, great depreciation rate, which is why I'm keeping it for now).

I plan on living the same lifestyle for the next five years, even given increases in income. So I will stick to spending about $32k per year and saving the rest. This means that after five years, if my income estimates are correct, I will have saved $240k.

All of my loans are paid off, so my current plan is to invest my savings in an index fund, such as VFINX. After 5 years, and at an estimated 7% annual return on VFINX, I would have approximately $277k saved.

The next part of the plan is more loose. I could see myself withdrawing my funds from VFINX and investing in properties (given my real estate background).

Iâ€™ve never invested and Iâ€™m trying to gain a sense of how compound interest fits into the equation with investing.

So youâ€™re adding money to your total money in that stock, which makes sense if those returns were dividends that paid out yearly and you could reinvest that amount in the stock. But it doesnâ€™t make sense when looking at it from the perspective of the stock value without dividends, such as year one itâ€™s worth $1000, year two it might be worth $1,200, year three maybe down to $900, and so on.

Having a hard time deciding if I should keep my Tacoma. Thoughts?

I own a 2016 Tacoma, currently paid off and valued at $27,500. It gets about 17mpg average and has been driven 45,000 miles.

Hi all,

Iâ€™m currently saving for a house and am considering investing my savings in a low risk mutual fund or index fund such as VFIAX or VTSAX. There are several reasons I am considering the short term risk of this.

1. Iâ€™m not ready to buy a house. Several reasons for this. Little market inventory, too little savings, and I still want to travel a bit before buying a house and settling down somewhere. I expect to want to move to and/or visit other places for at least 2 years, although this could be as long as 5 or more. The downside is I really donâ€™t know the exact number.

2.

Hi all, I think I might be in a bind.  Iâ€™m pretty sure I recharacterized money that was already backdoored (backdoor Roth).  These are all non deductible contributions. 

-  I contributed $1000 to Roth in 2020 by accident, and recharacterized this amount back to traditional over the phone with fidelity the same year showing $1237 on a 2020 1099-R with box 7 = N.  Converted this to Roth shortly thereafter 

-  I contributed another $1000 to traditional and converted this to Roth same year 2020

-  I contributed $1000 to traditional in year 2021 for prior year 2020. Converted in 2021

For some reason when I was doing taxes for year 2020 I accidentally requested online at fidelity in March 2021 to recharacterize $1000 in Roth (forgetting I asked them to do this already in 2020).  It was successful.  I received a 1099-R with 7 = R (2021) in the amount of $1317 and received a letter from fidelity saying it was successful.  I recharacterized this in 2021.  This $1000 I asked to recharacterize had to already been converted to Roth since there was no other direct contribution to Roth in 2020.   Hence, a double recharacterization. 

I believe this is not allowed according to Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (TCJA) of 2017. I called fidelity to see if they would send me new forms to correct the issue but was denied. 

I turned in my 2020/2021 taxes trying to account for the extra recharacterization but I probably did it wrong as my 2021 1099-R reflects this extra $1317 converted and 2022 taxes donâ€™t make sense.

Hey /r/PF,

Unsure if this is a better question for /r/tax but Iâ€™m in a predicament.

Iâ€™ve been blessed to where Iâ€™ve (so far) made $22k YTD on options trading. Not FDs or 0DTE.

I, currently live in Florida ($0 state capital gains taxes).

I really, really want to live in NYC. I know wherever you spend 183 days in the year is where youâ€™re a resident for tax season but NYC has part time resident taxes.

What Iâ€™m wondering is:

1. If a taxable event came prior to a domicile change (i.e. sale today, state change later), do I still get taxed for it when I file NYC taxes?
2. I have ~$27,000 of capital losses from the past 3 years that was pushed down on my 2022 tax return. Will this offset my gains (i.e. me, not having to pay taxes)?
3. Letâ€™s say I lose $10,000 of this $22,000 (same calendar year), do I still owe taxes on the $22,000 or does it become $12,000? Or since itâ€™s same calendar year Iâ€™m fine?
4. What difference would it make if I moved to NYC on July 2nd instead of June 1st? ( <183 days vs >183 days)
5. Is there anything Iâ€™m *not* doing that could help ease the tax burden? I imagine not because itâ€™s all short term trades but yeah.

Any help would be appreciated. Thanks so much!

f39ext,IPatEussy,"How can I negotiate salary as an Intern converting to full-time Business Analyst? (FL)

Hey, I'll try and make this short. 23 years old if that makes any difference.

Basically, I'm a Business Intellegence Intern at a company in my area who just got acquired by an even bigger company. Rumor has it that since we're going through a merger that they'll be having a hard lock on salary. I'll have been there for 11 month &amp; 2 weeks (in case they try to technically skimp on the year) as of my graduation (\~May 10th). I want to start getting into salary talks in early April. I am already hired on as a full-time employee, so all it is is just the finance department compensating me more and me possibly getting another interview. The company would not have to go through an strenuous conversion process since I'm already internal, I've already spoke to HR about this.

For my assumed position of an Associate/Junior Business Intellegence Analyst, median salary in my area is $66,342 per Glassdoor. There's a salary bump over a regular BA or Systems Analysts because we are half IT and work with visualizations.

I really want to ask for $65,000 because the work we do can be very difficult, exciting and valuable to the business. It's also very exciting to me when I get a new task! I mean, some day I really have to critically think and analyze and I 110% believe what I do, and will be doing, is worth $65,000. If anyone works with data cleansing, extraction, transforming, visualization, SQL, Tableau, SSRS, business requirements etc., I'm sure you understand how messy back end data and dependencies can get.

I'm expecting the company to give me a hard offer of $58,000-$62,000. I would be OK with $62,000 but not with anything less. Do I have any leverage as an Intern? I'll have had one year of experience come offer time (may after I graduate).

Also, can I tell them that I don't need the healthcare benefit until I'm 26 as a way to negotiate a higher salary or am I just screwing myself there?

Hey guys!

Iâ€™m single, rent and make 57K now in FL (no state tax). FICO 2 credit score of 740, CreditKarma credit score of 765. Student loans of &amp;lt;$14k. Graduated repayment of $80/m, then $104/m, then $135/m, $176/m, $228/m, all in two year spurts. Renting at $1,000/m. Current take home is $3200 post benefits but wonâ€™t be buying a new car until I sign an offer for higher paying job.

I have been interviewing for jobs within my field (business analytics), like 5 interviews a week, and I have two pending jobs ranging from min. 70k up to ~82k. Iâ€™m still applying though because nothings signed, but I wonâ€™t accept a new job under $70,000.

Iâ€™ve been looking at 2021 Hyundai Accentâ€™s &amp;amp; Kia Forteâ€™s. I really want a 2021 civic cause Iâ€™m a Honda guy, but theyâ€™re over $22k.

Anyways, I currently drive a 2003 civic with 223k miles on it. Aesthetically, itâ€™s garbage. But she runs amazing! Engine and transmission perfectly fine.

Within the past year, I have done both front axles, control arms, wheel bearings (guh), bushings, alignment, rear break drums, etc. I still have a power steering leak and theyâ€™ll have to replace part of the rack (thereâ€™s corrosion on the left side of the bottom of the rack). I go to my roommates father as a mechanic (has a shop, not back door). Anyways, this civic is costing me $1,000 or so YoY in replacements. Repairs havenâ€™t been just last year, Iâ€™m just going to save the time and not explain them all.

Iâ€™m a minimalist at heart and new cars freak me out. Scratches, dents, dings, higher insurance premiums, it just seems to unaffordable. Plus, since itâ€™s all suspension damage, I probably just canâ€™t drive lmao. I want to say irdgaf about keeping up with the joneses, I want freedom and to retire early.

To continue, I believe my car is $2,000 away from brand new. I need to fix the rack, get four new struts, and possibly due the timing belt/water pump and a new battery for maintenance. Other than that, I canâ€™t see anything else going wrong for a while. She does have an EVAP check light (famous P something code), which means I have to replace the cat. Iâ€™ve been driving w/ it for four years with this check light, so it doesnâ€™t need to be replaced.

Should I throw $1,500-$2,000 into my civic w/ insurance at $60/m, or should I buy a new car ~$18k after upgrades w/ a payment of ~$350/m and insurance of $200/m? I could put about 5K down. I figured buying new is the best route because of the low financing and dealer incentives.

If neither, what are your guys experience with buying used cars? Should I do dealer or private party? I have ~$8,000 cash.

I save about $2500/m towards my house right now. But have 0 investments. It all goes into a separate cash for housing purchase. Each paycheck $1250 hits one account w/ no card I choose not to touch and the rest in my main checking.

**Assets:**
I have 30k cash, 6k in crypto (9.5k invested), 10k in 401(k) (I donâ€™t include this in my net worth). Letâ€™s call it 36k.

Havenâ€™t posted here in a long time but Iâ€™m back for some advice. Iâ€™ll try and make it as quick as possible.

**Background**:

25M

Let me preface this and say I donâ€™t really believe in retirement as the age of 59 1/2 or 55. Not sure if I make it until then? Idk, life is weird to look 30+ years out. Iâ€™m sure you guys thought this way when you were younger too. Anyways.

I just signed a job w/ a tech company for 140k base and 10k bonus split into monthly payments over 12 mos. This is legit life changing. Iâ€™ve tripled my salary job hopping since covid.

The company offers a 50% 401(k) match up to 4%, or a total of 2%.

I live in Florida so there are no state taxes. This is a fully remote position, itâ€™s in my job offer â€” I (hopefully) canâ€™t be called back into office so I believe the job security is there. 

**This is where the questions come in** â€” when I put away 4% of my salary for 401(k) in a calculator, my taxes were like 18% (just federal). If I were to put in $1,500/m, or close to IRS max, my taxes were 15.35%. 

Does it make sense to max out my 401(k) for the tax benefit? I plan on buying a home in 1-2 years and none of my 401(k) vests until 3 years with the company. Iâ€™m unsure if I will be w/ them for 3 years. I see the true money in serial job hopping and am unsure if a 2% match over 3 years would be the golden handcuffs that would make me stay.

I understand that an IRA is taxed dollars first and you can pull out anytime (why not just a stock brokerage account then)? But I donâ€™t understand a Roth 401(k).

I know that there are special loopholes like your 401(k) isnâ€™t included in assets for like student loans, canâ€™t be taken from medical expenses etc., but are there any other loopholes? I would like to take a loan out against my 401(k) for FTHB purchase but doesnâ€™t that defeat the purpose of a 401(k)?

Iâ€™m wondering if I could â€œaffordâ€ to live alone. I know this post will seem like Iâ€™m trolling but Iâ€™m being 100% serious. Itâ€™s more or less to see if paying this much would stunt my financial growth overall. Currently live in FL.

26M, 140k base (tech, WFH), so I make $8,000/m take home after deductions and taxes. I have $60,000 in cash saved up w/ $13k in student loans coming due in August, or whenever forbearance is done. No car payments. No CC debt. Average spend of $3,500/m now w/ currently rent burden of $1,250.

I want to move to Miami but studio apartments after everything are ~$2,500, which is my absolute max. Ideally, Iâ€™d love for it to be $2,200. I am currently not open to having a roommate as Iâ€™m very picky w/ my living area and canâ€™t afford to trust a random. Plus, itâ€™d kinda be nice to not have a roommate anymore.

$2,500/$8,000 is nearly 32% of my take home going to rent. Am I wasting my money?

My logic for moving to Miami (Wynnwood/Downtown/Brickell) is itâ€™s walkable, diverse and Iâ€™ll be extremely close to the beaches. I hate driving (do own a car though). In addition, I think that living in a nice apartment complex around people my age would help me make friends as Iâ€™ll be moving there alone. Worse case scenario is I could pay the expensive rent for one year and then move further away after Iâ€™ve made friends.

Does it make sense to spend this much money on rent? If I canâ€™t be in a centralized area like one of the three I mentioned Iâ€™d rather not move. Let me know your thoughts.

vua86y,IPatEussy,"Traveling the U.S. for 4 months â€” am I missing anything in my budget?

Hey PF! Back again for more help and insight.

As the title says, Iâ€™ll be traveling the country next month. Iâ€™ll be covering 17 cities for 5-7 days each. I wonâ€™t have my apartment or a home to come back to so that way Iâ€™m not paying double rent. All my stuff will be stored at my friends house. I also wonâ€™t be driving/traveling w/ my car.

- Accommodation ($200/day)
- Transportation (Ubers, flights, trains &amp; buses i.e. NYC to D.C.)
- Sporting events 
- Nights out ($200/location)

x1iqgu,IPatEussy,"Is relocating to Manhattan lifestyle creep? + tax questions

Hi PF!

Hoping to make this short &amp; sweet.

26M tech worker. 140k base, 11k bonus. 3 years experience.

I have been WFH fully since COVID. 75k cash in savings, 43k student loan debt. Like 8k in my 401(k) but I donâ€™t even count that.  Considering relocating from FL to NYC in October/November.

Reasoning is I think FL is too slow/spread out for me (been here 4 years) and most of my friends/family are in CT/NJ/NY &amp; MA. NYCâ€™s public transport is unmatched so I wouldnâ€™t need a car and honestly hate driving anywhere over a half hour. In addition, for the prices in where Iâ€™d like to live (Tampa, Miami) I could afford to rent in NYC, even though Iâ€™ll get a 250 sqft apartment instead of a luxury apartment.

Anyways, my take home after taxes in NYC would be $7,350, right now my take home is $8,300 in FL. The job will give me a COLA to at *least* offset the taxes while relocating to NYC (this is guaranteed, theyâ€™re just waiting for me to submit the ticket to HR). So I would be making the same $8,300 at bare minimum.

My three questions are:

1. Is moving to NYC and paying ~$2,300 in rent â€œlifestyle creep?â€ Iâ€™m 26 now. Iâ€™ve lived with roommates before, I just donâ€™t want them. I wouldnâ€™t pay a brokerâ€™s fee so Iâ€™d live in just about anything. I also choose Manhattan over other boroughs because itâ€™s centralized and itâ€™s where my office is. Going rates on studios not in Harlem are about $1,900-$2,300 (StreetEasy). Also, the affordable areas of Brooklyn/Astoria arenâ€™t that much cheaper anymore to be living that far outside the city.

2. I got paid a ~$11,000 bonus earlier in June when I signed on my new company. This is when I was a Florida resident. I still am as of typing, but if I move to NYC, Iâ€™ll switch my license and domicile over. **Will this give NYC the right to tax that bonus even though I was a Florida resident at the time?**

3. Has anyone who lived in Manhattan ever ended up owning something in or around the city? Home ownership is very important to be (stability and wealth accumulation) and it just seems impossible to own anything in NY.

TL;DR â€” Is spending $2,300 on rent while making $8,300 lifestyle creep? In addition, if I got a bonus in a no-state tax state then moved to one with state taxes, would I get taxed on that?

10vbfcw,ir0nuckles,"Am I right to think the safest thing to do with RSUs is immediately sell them?

I got burned badly last year because I had a large RSU vesting cliff in March, and then company stock tanked 80% in a matter of weeks in May.

1195vic,ir0nuckles,"Take a smaller (sub-inflation) salary increase, or company stock?

I've been told I can choose between a salary increase or company stock. I can only get one. The salary increase is going to be less than inflation, I'm guessing around 3-5%.

11b0t7c,ir0nuckles,"Am I doing the best I can to be able to have a better future?

I live in a HCOL city where rent has been sky-rocketing. The plus side is that I have a decent income, and I've always been frugal, so I'm able to save about 60% of my income, and have been doing that for over a decade. I am way ahead on retirement savings and other investments. I also have a good chunk saved in cash-like vehicles for a home purchase or other large expense in the future. I should have about $120k in this short-term fund in another few months, and will probably continue to add to the fund after that.

Despite this, I feel pretty hopeless and depressed. I can save money, but I don't know to what end. I hate living in a big city and would be much happier in a less hectic and expensive place.  I also don't relate to many of my coworkers and peers around me. I used to be more like them, happy to enjoy the big city while I was young, but as I am getting older I feel the desire to escape to a more pastoral setting where i can live more simply and avoid big city problems. 

That is why I started saving up money for a home purchase. I'm getting very sick of renting as my landlord has continuously been doing loud construction and invasively entering my space over and over again. Lots of damage has occurred in the building and it's been disruptive. This is making me more aware of the benefits of owning a home. I tried to buy a  house during the pandemic, but prices were crazy and required that buyers take on all kinds of risks, like waiving inspection and appraisal contingencies. I decided that I would not take that kind of risk, so I'm stuck renting indefinitely, unless I move to another area or I marry someone with double my income. I'm prety depressed about the prospects of this happening, and it seems like I am just doomed to rent a small apartment that is perpetually under construction. I'm being a bit dramatic here, I can move when my lease is up, but I have had many similar issues living in any apartment block style housing with loud neighbors, security issues, etc. and I would like to have my own property, but this is looking very unaffordable for me, despite having a good income.

Am I doing the best I can here to prepare for a better future? I don't need luxuries,  just a simple life. To that end I am saving my income into:

- Emergency fund, around $17k now, enough to cover a couple months in event of a layoff. Already funded.

- Short-term fund, for home purchase or maybe something else if home ownership is really just becoming a thing of the past. This is about 75% funded now. I plan to get it to $120k and add to it more slowly after that. The actual funds are split between I-series bonds, CDs, and a high yield savings account. Looking at treasury bills as a possible option  here as well. 

- Retirement accounts. Around $250k now which assuming i don't touch for 30 years should be enough to cover a basic retirement at 67. Split between various vanguard index funds.

- Non-retirement investment accounts, currently around $500k. Split between various vanguard index funds, with a little bit in company stock. I consider this part of retirement.

My hope is that I can move within another few years to a non-HCOL area. I am pretty paranoid about finances and the economy, so layoffs and the possibility of losing income is fresh in my mind. i am known to be a chronic over-preparer.  Am I doing this right or am I a fool for waiting to buy a home? I am just afraid of buying something without an inspection and taking on all of the risk that comes with that.

11rbwwj,ir0nuckles,"Is it wise to invest in retirement accounts before you pay off all debt?

I've been giving a friend advice on getting their finances in shape. (They want help, it's not an imposition, and personal finance is one of my hobbies.)

They have a bit of debt, something on the order of $25-30k, between student and car loan. The car loan is from 2021 at a little higher rate with about $5-10k on the balance, but their student loans are lower and about $20k balance. My initial thought is to prioritize the highest rate loans first.

Their income is around $50k but varies depending on hours worked. Rent is around $1500. We live in a state with no state income tax. They are hoping to increase the income soon with a career change but are unsure how long that will take â€“ however, they have worryingly suggested they might take a lower paying job to work in their chosen field which would put them more around $40k. We live in a HCOL area so this is IMO not a great idea, unless there is some big benefit like loan reimbursement (there is not, to my knowledge) but this is what they went to school for. They are recent out of school and currently working a job they don't like but which does pay the bills.

The official /r/pf guide states to pay off all debt before putting any money in retirement beyond an employer match. However, this person doesn't have an employer match, and they are worried about not having enough saved for retirement. I suggested that they should strike a balance between both â€“ invest some for retirement now, as the additional years of compounding will pay off in a big way, but also pay off the debt at a more aggressive pace because eliminating the debt will save money from interest payments in the long run. They opened a Roth IRA and funded it and feel good about this move, however I'm now worried that I may have steered them wrong and they might be neglecting to pay off the debt. Then again I would not want them to skip investing entirely for the next 5-10 years just to pay off the debt, which is why I think a balance makes sense here.

What would you advise someone in their situation? Am i off base by suggesting a balance of early retirement investing AND aggressive debt repayment is important? 

As a side question, what do you think of their plan to take a lower paying job? It doesn't sound like the career path that move would open would increase their income above what they make now. As a financial decision I would say it's a bad one, but maybe they will enjoy the new field enough for it to be worth the loss of income.","Loss Aversion, Framing Effect, Present Bias, Status Quo Bias","The statement reflects several biases. Loss Aversion is evident in the concern about not having enough saved for retirement and the fear of neglecting debt repayment, indicating a desire to avoid losses in both scenarios. The Framing Effect is present in how the /r/pf guide's advice is framed as a strict rule, influencing the friend's and the author's perception of the situation. Present Bias is shown in the prioritization of short-term debt repayment and immediate retirement savings over long-term consequences. Additionally, Status Quo Bias might be influencing the friend's consideration of taking a lower-paying job, as they seem inclined to stick with their current situation or change it in a way that might not be optimal.","The user exhibits a tendency to make decisions based on loss aversion and short-term considerations, often prioritizing immediate concerns over long-term financial optimization.

As for the advice, it seems reasonable to suggest a balance between debt repayment and retirement savings, especially given the absence of an employer match. A balanced approach can help mitigate the psychological and financial impacts of debt and retirement savings concerns. However, it's essential to weigh the interest rates of the debts and consider the potential returns on investment in a retirement account. 

Regarding the plan to take a lower-paying job, it's crucial to consider not only the immediate financial implications but also the potential long-term benefits, such as job satisfaction and potential career advancement. If the new field offers non-monetary benefits that significantly outweigh the loss of income, it might be a worthwhile decision. However, if the primary motivation is to work in a chosen field without a clear path to increased income, it might be prudent to reassess and explore other options for career advancement and income growth."

I know this may seem silly, and I know I could just do this with spreadsheets, but I want to really *feel* the impact while continuing to save for my home ownership goal. I am also really trying to *automate* this experiment as much as possible so I don't have to do manual adjustments every month. 

The theory is, if I can get used to having my $XXXX transfered to ""escrow"" every month then I can buy with confidence knowing what my finances will look like every month -- not just on a spreadsheet, but having experienced it for months. This would help me feel less anxious about taking on the extra costs.

I'm going though some financial workbooks now and the DTI ratio confuses me a little. It's explained as the sum of your debts and obligations divided by your gross income. This apparently includes rent though it isn't really a debt, but I guess an ""obligation."" Given that rent is included, should I also include other fixed costs, like groceries, utility bills, memberships, and subscriptions? What exactly is included in the DTI calculation, and why? 

Second, how do you include variable income like stock grants, annual bonuses, commissions, etc. in this calculation? Would a bank or mortgage lender look at the previous year tax return to determine your income, or just a base pay?

Finally, I have read that most experts view a DTI of 30% as the target for most households to have enough to cover other costs, but i've also heard 36% as the upper threshold.

I'm trying to get an assessment of whether I'm financially ready to buy a home in the next 6-12 months, and whether or not my plan makes any kind of sense. Looking for suggestions and things I am missing.

**Debts / Credit accounts**:

- No debts â€“ paid off car, no student loans

- Two credit cards, auto-pay full statement balance every month

- Last credit I applied for was about a year ago, adding a credit card. Will this hurt me?

**Credit score**:

- Last hard pull I did for a mortgage application > 1 year ago it was over 800. Credit Karma says 758 and 770, but I would expect this to be higher in a real pull

**Personal Info**:

- Age 38

- Unmarried, no kids

- Current rent is about $2500 (18% DTI)

- Rental lease expires in about a year, but I can pay a $5,000 fee to terminate it early with 30 days notice. Month to month is possible but very expensive, like 2x the rent. (I mention this to give some idea of how to strategize around the lease end date.)

**Assets**:

- $270k in retirement accounts (401k, IRAs)

- $515k in taxable investment account (mainly broad US index funds)

- $22k in cash between checking and emergency fund

- $114k cash in my house fund (split between savings bonds, CDs, and MM funds â€“ should be matured and liquid by the end of the year)

- $23k company stock, which I'm in the process of selling to add to the house fund â€“ I am considering this as part of the ""house fund""

**Income**:

- Base salary $162,500 with about $8400 net monthly

- Contribute 11-12% of base to retirement

- Stock paid out quarterly, usually around $9000-$10,000, or about $38,000-$40,000 annually. 

**Financial Plan**:

- Planning to sell company stock, putting the current ""house fund"" up to $137k today.

- I plan to have $150k or more in my house fund at the end of the year when CDs and I-bonds mature. I also have some additional stock grant and savings I can add to the fund between now and then. All of this I am planning to keep in a Vanguard federal money market fund (VMFXX) which is currently earning 5.2%.

- I'd really like to put at least $150k into the down payment, as this really lowers the monthly, but worried I wouldn't have enough cash for closing and repairs / appliances / etc.

**Housing Plan**:

- Looking at a $500k ""starter home"" (sigh...) with > 20% down payment

This is all theoretical as Iâ€™m a very conservative investor (just long-term index funds).

Why not make a concrete â€œcash outâ€ deal with myself, say 10%, and when it hits that 10%, just cash out? Everything is low right now (and likely to continue lower), but if AMZ is at $80, nobody will argue that itâ€™s not going to hit $90 at some point.

* Full time job pays $22.15 an hour 50-60 hour weeks
* Part time job pays $13 an hour 16 hours currently 2 days a week potential for 32 hours 2 days a week
* Savings $7500, Roth IRA $8,858, HSA $2232
* No FASFA qualification 
* 20 Years old 
* Expenses $356 Medicine, $128 insurance, $474 car payment, $60 phone bill 
* AOTC forgot to figure in my calculations 
* pursuing accounting degree 

Current Situation I have 18K between savings roth and HSA, I am 24K in car debt for a 2021 Jetta R-line 54 of 60 months 1.9% $474 a month $128 insurance with an offer to sell for 24.5K. This car is preventing me from switching to one of my two jobs to focus completely on school. With my situation currently if unchanged and if I decide to do my one part time job id be riding a fine line of breaking even and negative with my income in terms of saving for school and paying expenses, if negative it would come from savings account which will have $7,500 in it when I leave my full time job and pay for school. The deficit I estimate would be small enough my savings could sustain for 6-7 years but with the time I have to focus on school I could complete my degree in 1.5-2 years as 1 year is already complete.  

Scenario 2 ensues selling my car and getting a cheaper one the best one I could find is 2014 corolla $16,620, my projected financing terms are gonna be 72 months @ 8% about 290 a month this would leave me positive $146 a month after paying for school. But with the amount I would pay in interest it would be absurd and I worry about being underwater in this loan and it potentially crapping out halfway through the loan. This car has passed inspections from mechanics I've taken it to and has a good autocheck score. 

Scenario 3 is getting the car but maintaining dual employment and paying it off like im gonna die if I don't, while still going to school, this would be very hard as I have to dedicate 50-60 hours to work that I can't focus on school,However at my other job 16 hours I could plus whatever I could manage on my days off I. After 6-7 checks of intensity at this loan I could work my one part time job. But since I could not take the extra hours at my second job the opportunity to would disappear as the hours need to be filled so id only be able to save $100 a month after expenses even after the car is paid off.  

Scenario 4 is selling my car and moving in with a supportive family member who is within walking or biking distance to the part time job I want to take, after expenses and saving for school I could save $550 a month which I would put only into savings to waitout the car market  

Scenario 5 is next year I project to make 70K with both jobs do nothing about the current car loan but make minimums Max out a 401K Roth IRA and HSA and contribute Excess to ESPP all of which could be accomplished with  my current expenses and do as many classes as I can bear to do with my working hours

This is indicative of Present Bias, where the user is weighing current costs more heavily than future benefits. Additionally, the user's detailed breakdown of effective interest rates for different loan options and their focus on reaching 20% equity to remove PMI suggests Mental Accounting, where they are compartmentalizing and tracking specific funds or accounts (in this case, the PMI and loan balances) rather than considering the overall financial picture.","The user exhibits a tendency to prioritize short-term financial considerations over long-term implications, reflecting biases towards present-focused decision-making and compartmentalized financial tracking."

Hi everyone, what is the best way to find furnishings for my new home? Every website I look at is so expensive, so Iâ€™m looking for the best value.","Framing Effect, Anchoring","The statement mentions that ""every website I look at is so expensive,"" which suggests that the individual has been exposed to high prices online, influencing their perception of what is expensive. This could be an example of the Anchoring bias, where the high prices on websites serve as an anchor, making other prices seem more reasonable by comparison. Additionally, the framing of the question as ""finding the best value"" implies that the individual is loss-averse and focused on avoiding high costs, which could be related to the Framing Effect, where the way information is presented (in this case, as a search for value) influences their decision-making.","The user exhibits a tendency to be influenced by initial exposures to high prices and frames their decision-making in terms of finding value, indicating biases related to Anchoring and Framing Effect."
r3w7qb,JayceThompson101,"Company is asking Wife to pay back entire yearly salary?

Hi everyone, my Wife used to work for a company that she recently resigned from. This company is known for being toxic and having a bad culture. This is a professional level job in IT Sales. She was working for 9 months then decided to quit to pursue a different position and the company she left Finance/Payroll department reached out and said she owes them 56k and to wire it to their company bank account. I checked the emails and the bank account is legit. I went to her payroll manager and added up all the gross pay from her 8 months of paychecks and that totals 56k gross pay. Is this even legal? What should we do here? We replied back and said that this request is a mistake. We have not agreed to any form of payment, so no slip ups there. Also they are asking us to send gross pay rather than net pay which is actually 45k, so this just doesnâ€™t make sense. Any help here is appreciated!

Edit: There is no repayment clause in the contract. No commission advancement. Just a clearly stated base pay with opportunity to earn on target earnings. Cookie cutter offer letter employment contract that you would see in any other fortune 500 firm. Read every word.","Affect Heuristic, Loss Aversion, Framing Effect","The writer of the statement appears to be influenced by the Affect Heuristic, as their emotional response to the company's request for repayment is driving their reaction. The writer describes the company as ""toxic"" and having a ""bad culture,"" which suggests that their negative emotions towards the company are clouding their judgment. Additionally, Loss Aversion may be at play, as the writer is focused on the potential loss of $56k and the perceived unfairness of the request. The Framing Effect is also present, as the writer is framing the company's request as a ""mistake"" and emphasizing the discrepancy between the gross pay and net pay amounts.","The user exhibits a tendency to make decisions based on emotional reactions and framing effects, rather than objective analysis, when faced with a potentially threatening or unfair situation."
rflmf7,JayceThompson101,"Ordered TV 6 months ago, opened it today, big crack, what so I do?

I bought a samsung tv 6 months ago during a sale from their official website. I received the package and had not opened it until today. Well there is a huge crack the size of a dime on the TV screen. I have a 1 year manufacturer warranty but it does not cover physical damage after registering my device and putting in a service request. The TV cost me $1700 and I am getting a quote from a verified repair shop of $1400 to fix, with the screen costing $1250 as a replacement part. I am outside the return policy window as well since it has been 6 months. What do I do here? It feels terrible spending $1700 on a TV and $1400 on top just to fix it...","Sunk Cost Fallacy, Loss Aversion","The individual is struggling with the decision of whether to repair or not repair their damaged TV, which was purchased for $1700. The sunk cost fallacy is evident as they are considering spending an additional $1400 to fix the TV simply because they have already invested $1700 in it. This line of thinking implies that they feel the need to ""get their money's worth"" from the initial purchase, even if it doesn't make sense economically. Additionally, loss aversion is present as the individual is hesitant to accept the loss of $1400 to repair the TV, and instead is weighing the costs and benefits of fixing it, which is causing them distress.","The user exhibits a tendency to prioritize past investments over future costs and is averse to realizing losses, leading to a biased decision-making process."
s7wkuy,JayceThompson101,"PMI fees are 25% higher than what I was told?

Hi everyone, I just closed on a home for 5% down with a 385k loan. My loan officer told me that the PMI would be $100/month, but I am making my first mortgage payment and the escrow account is charging me $125/month for my PMI. This is a whopping 25% increase, do you have any advice on what I should do here?","Anchoring, Loss Aversion, Regret Aversion","The statement reveals several biases. The homeowner is surprised by a 25% increase in PMI fees compared to what they were initially told ($100/month vs. $125/month), which indicates anchoring bias, as they are fixated on the initial quote and perceiving the difference as a significant increase. Additionally, the homeowner's emphasis on the 25% increase and describing it as a ""whopping"" rise suggests loss aversion, as they are sensitive to the perceived loss. Furthermore, the homeowner's prompt to seek advice implies regret aversion, as they are trying to avoid making a wrong decision and potentially regretting it in the future.","The homeowner exhibits a tendency to be influenced by initial information, be sensitive to perceived losses, and seek to avoid potential regret in their financial decisions."
t1psoz,JayceThompson101,"What car can I afford with high income, but low net-worth? (Mid 20s)

Together we earn 310k gross and 190k post taxes and maxing investment accounts. Our spend rate at tops is 6k a month which includes our housing and total monthly costs (food/bills/gym/etc.). We currently save around 10k a month after all expenses. We currently have 60k cash saved up and are in our mid 20s. We both paid off a combined 100k in debt and bought a home last year hence the low cash amount. No debt at the moment besides 370k on mortgage at 3% rate.

Weâ€™ve always wanted a nice car and truthfully believe that sure it isnâ€™t the best investment, but because we are high earners and live below our means - it is okay to spend a little luxury money to achieve something weâ€™ve always wanted.

My question to the subreddit is what is the upper budget of a luxury car we can afford? I really want a Model S Plaid (lol). Thank you!","Present Bias, Mental Accounting, Affect Heuristic","The individual in question exhibits Present Bias, as they prioritize their current desire for a luxury car over long-term financial goals, rationalizing that their high income and savings rate justify the expense. Mental Accounting is also present, as they separate their income into different categories (e.g., ""luxury money"") and justify spending on a car because they feel they've earned it. Additionally, the Affect Heuristic is at play, as their emotional desire for a luxury car (specifically, a Model S Plaid) drives their decision-making, leading them to downplay the potential drawbacks of such a purchase.","The user tends to prioritize short-term desires over long-term financial goals, rationalizing luxury spending as a reward for their high income and disciplined savings habits."
vii8gn,JayceThompson101,"What is considered total comp in a FAANG company?

Hi guys, I have a job offer for microsoft. Iâ€™m curious on how the community views total comp. For example my base salary is 180k and I have 100k in stock (RSUs) vesting over 4 years. 

Does that mean my total comp is 280k? Or should I divide my RSUs by years, meaning my total comp is $205k?","Anchoring, Mental Accounting","The user is seeking community input on calculating total compensation for a job offer at Microsoft, comparing it to FAANG companies. They provide a specific example with a base salary of $180k and $100k in stock (RSUs) vesting over 4 years. The user is unsure whether to consider the total stock value ($100k) or an annualized value ($25k) when calculating total compensation, resulting in two different estimates ($280k or $205k). This indicates Anchoring, as the user is fixating on the specific values provided ($180k and $100k) and using them as reference points for their calculation. Additionally, Mental Accounting is present, as the user is treating the stock and salary as separate accounts, rather than considering their combined value in a more holistic manner.","The user exhibits a tendency to rely on specific, potentially irrelevant numbers (Anchoring) and to mentally segregate different components of their compensation (Mental Accounting)."

My wife and I are in our mid 20s and just started maxing our 401k. If we both max our 401ks for the next 35 years then we should theoretically have enough to retire, right? This way we donâ€™t have to save excessively unless we want to retire early. What are your thoughts?","Overconfidence, Present Bias, Mental Accounting","The statement exhibits several biases. The assumption that maxing out 401(k) contributions for 35 years will be sufficient for retirement displays Overconfidence, as it overlooks other potential expenses, financial obligations, and the possibility of needing more savings for a comfortable retirement. Additionally, the focus on 401(k) contributions as the sole savings strategy reveals Mental Accounting, where the individual compartmentalizes their savings goals and neglects other potential savings needs. The statement also implies Present Bias, as the individual prioritizes current consumption (or reduced savings) over future needs, assuming that 401(k) contributions alone will suffice.","The user exhibits a tendency to oversimplify complex financial decisions, relying on a single savings strategy and displaying overconfidence in their ability to achieve retirement goals."
