I worked doing DoorDash and GrubHub, I feel like it wasnâ€™t worth it in the long haul. The overall income was roughly $8,000 over a year. In that year, I averaged roughly $20 an hour. Thatâ€™s great pay, but thatâ€™s not including expensesâ€¦ 

Averaging $1 per mile, I drove roughly 8,000 miles. With my Corolla and Honda Civic, thatâ€™s a little under 26mpgâ€¦ with the average gas being a little over $2. Thatâ€™s $615 on gas alone. The taxes on that year was roughly $400. That brings the total down to around $7,000.

Now the west and tear of the vehicle. Bought two cars to DoorDash and daily commuters for $4000 (Honda Civic) and $2,500 (Toyota Corolla). The Honda was a lemon and died within 5,000mi. Sold it for roughly $1,000 after. The Corolla has been reliable with roughly $150 in repairs. This would bring my total down to $3,850.

11cp78n,MonsieurVox,"Struggling to quantitatively compare HSA vs PPO options

Quick background: I'm starting a new job soon and have the option to choose between a plan with an HSA and a PPO. I'm well aware of the tax benefits of an HSA and have been using one for about a year or so, but I have some fairly expensive medications that are making me second guess myself.

As with most (all?) HSA plans, the cost of prescriptions is 100% until the deductible is met, then 10% copay thereafter until the OOP max is met.

With the PPO/PCA plan, approved medications are 10% copay from the beginning. The company also gives you $750 on a debit card for medical expenses (I think this is called an FSA?)

I don't recall what the OOP max is for them, but I remember them being pretty close.

Here's what I'm looking at for each plan:

||PPO Plan|HSA Plan|
|:-|:-|:-|
|Annual Premium|$1,950|$825|
|Annual Payroll Contribution|$0|$3,850|
|Annual Employer Contribution|$(750)|$0|
|Deductible|$1,500|$1,500|
|Tax Savings (24% bracket)|$(468)|$(1,122)|
|Annual medication cost (est.)|$192|$1,638|
|Total out of pocket (premium + meds)|$2,142|$2,463|
|Total savings (tax savings + employer contribution)|$(1,218)|$(1,122)|
|Net cost|$924|$1,341|

Ostensibly, the net cost for the HSA is about $400 more annually, but it doesn't feel like a fair comparison because that doesn't account for the money I'm stashing away into the HSA that I get to keep and invest. Even if it costs me $400 more per year out of pocket, my thinking is that the remaining invest-able cash that goes into my HSA should more than make up for that over time. 

I'm also not sure how to factor in doctor's appointments or things like x-rays that occur as needed, so I excluded them from my calculations altogether.

My general takeaway is that the PPO plan would be a lot easier and more convenient in the short term, but the HSA has a long-term payoff if I stick with it.

Am I missing or overlooking something?","Mental Accounting, Framing Effect","The user is exhibiting Mental Accounting bias by separating the HSA contributions from their overall financial situation, treating the HSA as a separate mental account where the ""remaining invest-able cash"" can be kept and invested.

129r0f6,MonsieurVox,"How do people generally save for large investments like a rental property?

**TL;DR up front: How does one save for a large investment like a rental property? Despite having a good income and net worth, stockpiling the cash required to make this purchase seems daunting without making impactful changes like changing my 401k/IRA contributions, selling investments, etc.**

For those who read all of this, thank you very much and apologies for the brain dump!

For those who have invested in real estate (or other capital intensive investment), what specifically did you do to pile up the cash? 

* How much did you save?
* How long did it take you to save that much?
* Did you keep the money in a HYSA or invest it?
* Did you stop or slow down retirement account contributions to have more cash to save?
* Did you take out a loan for the down payment? Was it a business loan, personal loan, 401k loan, something else?
* What other ""levers"" are there to pull?

For some additional context, I'm 30 years old and a pretty high income earner in my area (roughly $210,000 gross after bonuses in a decently low cost of living area). I can generally max out my tax-advantaged retirement accounts, but I want to make an eventual move out of the 9-5 lifestyle and into something like real estate. My parents own rental properties so I'm well aware of the work that goes into them and am under no delusion that real estate is ""passive income.""

Financially, I have roughly $240,000 in investments:

* $190,000 401k
* $30,000 Roth IRA
* $9,000 taxable brokerage (this is earmarked specifically for this investment)
* $10,000 crypto 

I also have:

* $18,000 in my emergency fund
* $10,000 in an I bond
* \~$120,000 in home equity in my primary residence

The absolute *cheapest* property in my area that is livable and/or wouldn't require an immense amount of rehab is around \~$200,000, so at *minimum* I'd need $40,000 to even have a shot. I'd likely need much more when factoring in the expenses that come with purchasing a piece of real estate.

Despite having a good income, I'm finding it difficult to save enough cash to be able to put down the requisite 20% for something like a multi-family home. 

I wouldn't want to take out my Roth IRA contributions, I wouldn't want to take a 401k loan, my emergency fund is right at 6 months and gives me peace of mind, and the I bond is only \~5 months old. So despite having a net worth of \~$400,000+, very little of it is actually usable without taking a hit in taxes, selling my 2.875% mortgage house, etc.

If I wanted to buy in the next year, the most logical thing that I see would be to sell the crypto, liquidate the brokerage account, sell the I bond, and set aside that \~$30k in a HYSA and continually add to it over the coming months. Unfortunately I'd be taking a loss on all of those, but that's what I get for taking a short-sighted approach.

Past that, what other things might I be overlooking? Would it be foolish to slow down 401k/IRA contributions? A HELOC seems risky, but is that a common option for folks getting into real estate?

143hk4e,MonsieurVox,"Does it make sense to convert my Vanguard funds to Fidelity funds?

To be brief, I moved my Roth IRA from Vanguard to Fidelity.

I'm about 50/50 in VIGAX and VFAIX, with both having about $17,000 invested in them ($34,000 total account balance). I bought these funds while my IRA was with Vanguard so of course didn't pay any fees at that time. 

I was considering consolidating both funds into FXAIX since there's already a big overlap between the Vanguard funds and the expense ratio is lower for the Fidelity version of the S&P 500 fund.

I want to a) double check my math and b) see if I'm overlooking anything.

* On the convert funds page, it looks like there would be a $75 fee to do this for each fund. 
* VIGAX has a 0.05% expense ratio.
* VFAIX has a 0.04% expense ratio.
* FXAIX has a 0.015% expense ratio.

Annualized, this would be:

* ($17,000 x .005) + ($17,000 x .004) = $153 in fees at Vanguard
* (34,000 x 0.0015) = $51 in fees at Fidelity if I exchanged
* $102 in fee savings at Fidelity annually (everything else equal), so roughly a 1.5 year break-even period to sell the Vanguard funds (2 \* $75 = $150)

Does that look right?

Just at a fee level, it seems like a no brainer since it's a short break-even period and it would save me thousands over the course of my retirement journey. 

There's a huge overlap in holdings between VIGAX and VFAIX, so I think it makes sense to collapse those down into one fund, and then of course VFAIX and FXAIX should be identical with the exception of interest rate.

It's obviously not a make or break decision, more of an optimization.

166n4ig,MonsieurVox,"Does it makes sense to put in a homeowner's insurance claim for this?

A few weeks ago I was carrying a fold-able/collapsible crate down my stairs that had two buckets of paint in it from a recent bathroom remodel. As I got to the top of the stairs, the crate collapsed (go figure), and two buckets of paint tumbled down the stairs, exploding, leaving paint all over the stairs, floors, front door, and walls. After spending an entire afternoon and into the evening trying to clean up what I could, I ultimately had to make the decision to entirely replace the floors and have the walls repainted. 

I didn't even think to contact my insurance about this at the time and paid for it out of pocket using my emergency fund and some cash flow. All in, the project cost me about $10,500 (materials and labor) and my front door still has paint on it. From the date of the incident to the job being done was less than a week.

I got some pictures during the attempted cleanup, but was so busy panicking immediately after it happened that I didn't get pics immediately after it happened at its worst.

uz4nmd,MonsieurVox,"Contributing to a taxable brokerage instead of a mega backdoor Roth - am I making a big mistake?

Hey good folks, got a question that I haven't been able to find a clear answer for. I'll first give some background, which should help clarify why I'm asking my question.


**Background**: I recently started a new job with a gross pay of around $220k. This is more than I've ever made before, and along with it came some decisions that I had to make and topics I had to research. I'm also single with no kids, I own a house, and have a paid off car. I have no other debt other than my house.

I'm maxing out my Traditional 401k (for the tax deduction) and Roth IRA. My company also allows after-tax contributions and an in-plan conversion (aka mega backdoor Roth) on those contributions. 

Since I am aiming to invest about 25% of my gross income, maxing out my Traditional 401k ($20,500) and backdoor Roth ($6,000) is gets me to ~11% of my gross income, which leaves about $28,500 on the table to invest. I also dabble in crypto but that's purely speculative and I'm not including that in my retirement percentage.

I will be 30 years old at the end of this year, and currently have about $200,000 in retirement savings; this mostly consists of a previous employer's 401k and my Roth IRA. 

Because I already have a nice chunk in retirement and am mostly taking advantage of all of the tax benefits of the 401k and Roth IRA accounts, for the last few months I have been contributing to my taxable brokerage account *instead* of doing the mega backdoor Roth for the flexibility it provides. To be specific:

1. Those funds can be withdrawn without penalty and could be used for a bridge account for early retirement 
2. I could use those funds to eventually purchase a cash flowing asset, a down payment for a rental property/AirBnB, or some other cash-flowing asset (which is a longer term goal of mine)

**This background leads me to my questions:**

* I feel like I understand the opportunity cost of not doing the backdoor Roth, but am I overlooking something? 
* Is this a terrible idea? 
* Would it be better to compromise and contribute a bit into the mega backdoor portion and reduce my taxable brokerage contributions?

vv55tc,MonsieurVox,"Mutual fund vs. ETF in terms of ""buying at a discount""

Hey all, got a pretty basic question that I'm hoping someone can clarify for me. Hopefully I can word this in a way that makes sense.

When choosing between two equivalent investments in the form of mutual funds and ETFs (let's say VFIAX and VOO, respectively), holding everything else equal (fees, etc.), does it matter which type someone purchases? 

Here's what I mean. As the market goes down, the price of a single ""unit"" or share of VOO becomes cheaper. As the market goes up, so does the price of that same share of VOO. So, when people talk about ""buying at a discount,"" the analogy makes perfect sense. (Recognizing that it's an imperfect analogy.)

When contributing to the mutual fund version of what is essentially the same investment, does that same principle hold true? 

My understanding is that a mutual fund is essentially a giant pool of money that gets allocated into a variety of investments based on the purpose of the fund. In this way, you aren't exactly ""buying shares"" so much as you are contributing to the overall pool of money.

I'm probably overthinking it, and I would assume that the same idea applies to both mutual funds and ETFs, but I'm hoping someone can explain it to me in a way that makes sense.","Framing Effect, Mental Accounting","The user is exhibiting the Framing Effect bias by being influenced by the way information is presented, specifically the analogy of ""buying at a discount"" when it comes to ETFs.

Let me preface this that I recognize the fortunate financial position I'm in. This is truly not intended as a sort of humble-brag but I don't know of any way to ask this question without it coming across that way. 

I've read the Prime Directive and I think I'm pretty much following it to a T. My question is more about my percentages and if I may be overlooking anything to save on taxes.

I'm 30 years old. Not married. No kids. Only debt is my house, which I bought in 2019 and owe $218,000 on at 2.875%. Just had it appraised to knock off PMI and it came back valued at $340,000.

I've been at my new company for almost a year now. My salary puts me in the 35% tax bracket before deductions, 32% bracket after deductions. 

Here's how my saving and investing is broken down:

* Max out pre-tax 401k for the tax deduction ($20,500 in 2022)
   * Invested 100% in an S&amp;P 500 fund
* Roughly $10,000/year going into after-tax 401k, which will be converted to Roth at year-end (mega backdoor Roth)
* Max out HSA ($3,150, company contributes $500)
   * Just started this year. It's not invested yet as I want one year of out of pocket maximums liquid before investing. **Is this a bad idea?**
* Max out backdoor Roth IRA ($6,000 in 2022)
   * Invested 50% in a growth stock index fund, 50% in an S&amp;P 500 index fund (recognizing there's a huge overlap between the two funds and I'd probably be better off just putting it all in the S&amp;P fund...)
* $10,000 in I Bonds at 9.62% for 2022
* $1,250 per month going into my savings/brokerage
   * I have M1 Finance and my savings automatically spills over into a taxable brokerage once the dollar amount exceeds my emergency fund amount, which then gets auto-invested based on my investment allocation which is 90% funds and 10% in an individual stock.
   * The taxable brokerage is mainly earmarked as a long-term sinking fund and/or bridge account for early retirement. Long-term savings examples would be:
      * Large car down payment/paying for a car in cash
      * House down-payment (primary residence or rental)
      * Home renovations
      * Vacations
* $500/month into crypto. Purely speculative.

&amp;#x200B;

All in, I'm saving roughly 28% of my gross pay. The only area(s) I could see improving on would be to contribute more to my after-tax 401k OR more towards my taxable brokerage. I already have so much going into retirement that I'm leaning towards the taxable brokerage due to the flexibility it offers (no penalties for withdrawals, etc.).","Overconfidence, Mental Accounting","The user's detailed breakdown of their saving and investment allocations suggests a high degree of financial sophistication.

- **Question 1**: How am I doing overall?

I know people get annoyed with these, but I swear I've never done one! I'm 33 and have been following personal finance blogs (like MMM) and this sub since I graduated college. I think I'm a diligent saver who has found a balance between living and being frugal:

Salary - $120k

Checking account - $23k

I-bonds - $10.5k

Taxable investments - $8k

Crypto - $4k

401k - $145k

Roth IRA - $78k


Co-Op value (according to Zillow, grain of salt etc...) - $270k

Mortgage remaining - $172k

Monthly payment (with HOA) - $1800

- **Question 2**: Is this an ok allocation?

I also wanted to ask about my allocations. Are there better allocations I could use for my personality and age?

Roth IRA is with Vanguard. I have:

45% VFIAX

45% VTSAX

10% VBTLX

My 401k also offers Vanguard funds, and I am:

92% VSMPX

8% VBTIX

- **Question 3**: 

When I first graduated I hated working and gravitated to places like MMM because I wanted it to end as soon as possible. However, after job hopping, I got a job as an R&amp;D engineer in the national lab/university ecosystem. I love it, it gives me no existential dread, and this is the dream job I always imagined when I was taking high school physics. However, salary growth in this field is extremely limited from where I am. I only got to my current salary by getting competing job offers in industry and being a real hardass and showing willingness to leave.

The conventional wisdom on this sub (and /r/askengineers) is that you should hop jobs every 3-5 years, and if you didn't get a 9% raise this year you're a loser for staying at your job and you should have been interviewing 6 months ago. However, I remember what working in a corporation or small business is like and honestly it's soul-crushingly terrible compared to my current job.

However, I do want to have a house and kids and all that, and in my area, even with a nearly $100k down payment, that's a $4k a month bill, so that would be difficult for me and a spouse earning similarly to me. I don't know if I'd be able to give my kids the middle class childhood I had on my current salary and that also gives me existential dread.

Sometimes reading this sub and its tone makes me feel like a loser who isn't doing what a responsible adult does to maximize income. Sometimes I feel like throwing up my hands, building a Github on nights and weekends, and transferring to software development and hopping jobs and playing that game. Sometimes I feel like life is pretty good though because I currently enjoy my job and girlfriend and I think I have a decent savings rate.

12a9t9c,Mother_Welder_5272,"Discussion - Spending rules of thumb: In the US, has the fundamental proportion of the average salary going to housing vs. other goods changed?

I was talking to some people about traditional rules of thumb, like your mortgage/rent should be 1 weeks pay and so on. It's obviously nearly impossible to follow that rule if you're an average earner looking for average lodgings in 2023. But when talking to some older people, I got a new perspective.

While many of them were able to abide by that rule, the cost of other goods was just so much more. Cars were half a year's salary or more. TVs and entertainment were significant financial purchases. Random things like barbecues, playpens for your kids, matresses, everything seems like it cost a high percentage of your salary now.

I'm not an economist, but I did come across this chart, which seems to fit my hypothesis:

And I'd assume that the trends were even more striking if you went back 50 years. It made me think that maybe we're not in such a bad situation if we're ""breaking"" the 25% or 36% or whatever rule. I can literally get a mattress, TV, game console and 5 video games for less than the monthly cost of my 1 bedroom condo. It doesn't seem like that was the reality 20, 30, 40, years ago. 

In my life today, as a single man, housing and health insurance/health care are my biggest expenses by a long shot, they just dwarf all my other spending. It's easy for me to spend very little money and be fully entertained and fed *once my shelter costs are taken care of*. If I had the same lifestyle 40 years ago, I have this hypothesis that even if you normalize for my spending, the proportion going to those big categories and other miscellaneous expenses would be quite different.

It seems that rent/house prices are some of the most subjective when it comes to a free market. The prices will literally go as high as the market will bear, and the prices will always be an arbitrary gauge as to the available salary of the population. Unlike things like TVs, there's not really a competitive aspect that will force sellers to go down.

I have scoured LinkedIn, changed jobs, and gotten offers from companies in my state and all neighboring states, and usually they're not any more than I earn now. There's a fundamental part of me that feels like I'd kind of be a faceless schlub in the way I viewed myself if I just sighed, spent the few years changing fields, and went with the generic job that pays more in corporate law or business consulting or whatever.

I also know that the advice is often to move. Move to a lower cost of living area and save more. Move to a popping city where you can maximize your earnings early in life, etc... But I do have a very active social life in my current area, with a very big network of family and friends. I have constant invites to barbecues and board games, and impromptu nights that give me belly laughs so hard I can't breathe. It's a good life in that regard, and I feel privileged in that I can't relate at all to the news stories saying ""X% of Americans can't name a single friend, say they suffer from loneliness"". I think it really helps my mental health and it feels un-intuitive to leave that.

And I guess I've always just had a predilection for admiring people who have a life calling that extends beyond just making money in a faceless corporate job. For example, right now, there are startups trying to do wild work with neural implants. There's currently no active market for it, nobody is selling these to consumers. It's an industry that runs on VC money and government grants. But one day, in 2030 or 2040, when the first implant that can record your dreams to a video is commercially available for purchase, to me, the ""honor"" lies with those engineers and researchers who stuck it out for decades. Who could have ""maximized their income"" by working a generic job, and maybe even took paycuts when the VC money ran out, but they had something to get out of bed for, which resulted in something that genuinely changes the world. Thinking about being like one of those people just excites me in a way that ""Emotionlessly switch jobs every 2-3 years to maximize your income"" and ""choose a field that pays the most. The field is subject to change often, so don't get attached to any specific one"" does not. Yet it's hard to deny that being like me can limit your income, and in today's economy, maybe not even give me the standard of living with housing and leisure options that my parents and grandparents had. To me, this is a constant struggle that I'm beating myself up over. Do I ""sell out"" or do I stay the course? Are there better ways I can look at and contextualize my life? 

Are there any financial subreddits that talk about this human/mental side of saving, rather than just the dollars and cents and investment portfolios and strategies? I've gone to the therapy, but I haven't found a therapist who really satisfies what I want out of these discussions. I understand that my reasoning is seen by some people as me being a small town loser who can't realize I'm making excuses for not fully hustling and taking life by the horns or whatever. And some people think it's really nice that I have something driving me besides just money and the dream of a generic vacation at a beach resort.

I feel like I'm hyper aware of every dollar I spend at the moment I spend it, even with a credit card, and putting it in a monthly statement or spreadsheet form does nothing for my understanding of how frugal I'm being.

uukq53,Mother_Welder_5272,"If selling one property to trade up to another, is it possible to not use the sale funds to pay off the mortgage? Example within.

For example (I'll use round numbers that demonstrate my situation), I bought a condo in late 2019 for $200k. Right now, it's worth $250k. I refinanced in late 2020 and it's a ~3% loan and I have $175k left on it. Let's say I want to move up to a $500k house within a year or so. Now, mortgage rates are higher, and I'd assume it would be 6% by the time I buy. From the order of operations here:

https://www.zillow.com/sellers-guide/what-happens-when-you-sell-a-house-with-a-mortgage/

It looks like I would sell my condo at $250k, pay off the $175k, and after fees, have something like $50k to apply as an extra downpayment or just hold as an emergency fund. However, that means I'm taking a **~$400k mortgage at 6% for the new house (assuming I also apply $50k I'd been saving for the new downpayment)**.

Wouldn't it be better to not apply any of the sale funds to the mortgage? After fees, let's say I net $225k in cash after the sale. And then just dump that all into a downpayment on the house?

Even less of a principal if I apply any of the money I had set aside for a new downpayment.**

From my estimates this would give me a lower monthly payment, and have me pay less interest over the life of both loans.

wj808y,Mother_Welder_5272,"Is it ok to take money out from a Roth IRA for a house down payment if I've been ""oversaving"" for a long time? (33 years old)

I graduated college in 2011 (33 years old) and have gone from a $50k job out of college, back to school for a Master's, to a $120k job now. I've always been a heavy saver. Outside of saving up for a 20% down payment for my $215k 1 bedroom condo a few years ago, I throw everything into tax advantaged accounts, maxing out my 401k and Roth IRA as often as I can. I've usually run pretty lean with the emergency funds, just because no one depends on me and I live pretty cheap. I was single and lived a bachelor life for most of my 20s. My only other factor was $10k put into a side business that doesn't look like it's going to go anywhere in the end.

My status:

Salary - $120k

Roth IRA (with previous 401ks rolled in) - $80k

401k (been at my current job for 5 years) - $140k

I-bonds - $10k

Crypto/Brokerage Stocks - $15k

Condo Mortgage - $173k left

Condo value - probably $230-250k now

Bank checkings/savings - $15k

No other student loan, credit card, or auto debt.

I've read enough of this subreddit to know that I'm probably ""oversaving"". I only have $15k of liquid money, and maybe double that if I liquidate all my non-retirement funds (although there would be taxes for sure). The thing is, I feel like I've now been growing up a bit. I've had some serious relationships recently and could now see myself settling down in a single family house. Not now, not with anyone in particular, but maybe in the next 3-5 years. Even if not that, I was curious about keeping an eye on the real estate market and looking for a good deal on a rental property, again in the time span of a few years.

With the way houses are costing now ($500-700k+ in my area), I'm thinking that if I pulled the trigger on any of these, I'd have to have a solid $100k in down payment. Of course if I did it with a spouse, they'd probably contribute. And in that case, ideally I'd like to keep my condo and rent it out. But I feel a little behind when I see that I only have a tiny fraction of that ready.

I know that I can take contributions and rollovers out of the Roth IRA penalty free. And probably $40k of the IRA is available to take out penalty free right now. I know that all financial advice frequently tells you never to raid your retirement accounts. And that if buying a house is in your goals, you should save for the down payment before contributing past the employer match (The Prime Directive, etc...). But when I look at my net worth history chart, I feel like it kind of worked out for me. By shoveling money into the S&amp;P 500 since 2011, I've been able to make good gains on these vehicles of Roth IRAs and 401ks that can be taken out/borrowed from with no tax penalty.

If I had followed the prime directive perfectly, I may have had $100k in liquid savings, but maybe like $50k in retirement savings and have missed out on a lot of compound growth. Rather than having &gt;$200k in retirement savings and only $15k in liquid savings.

I guess my problem is more conceptual. I feel instinctively that pulling out from the retirement accounts for a down payment is ""bad"". But since I had a time scale of a decade or more before needing that big down payment, I feel like oversaving in retirements accounts, letting it grow a little, and then pulling it out, was probably the best move.

So is pulling money out of a Roth IRA or taking a 401k loan for a down payment a bad idea?

With interest rates what they currently are and prices what they are in the Bay Area, there's no way I'd be able to buy a comparable condo, so I would have to go back to renting. I really don't know how to calculate this to convert into an equivalent salary increase to break even. It's not as simple as ""new rent - current mortgage + closing and selling fees"", right?

Another reason I'm considering this move is that I've discovered that I really don't like snow, so I will make this or a similar move eventually, but I don't think this is enough of a reason to rush. I can endure another winter or two waiting for the right opportunity, but knowing what that right opportunity is is the main crux of this question.

My current math is something like: (current salary * COLA difference + cost of housing difference) * minimum acceptable raise = minimum acceptable salary to make this move.

Are there other factors that I should also consider? Friends and family don't really matter here since I don't have deep roots in my current location so it's the same here and there.","Anchoring, Loss Aversion, Mental Accounting","The user is attempting to calculate the minimum salary increase required to justify a significant life change, including relocating and switching from owning to renting a home.

rkrgt2,Mountebank,"If youâ€™re covered by a 401k at work, what income range makes sense for a traditional IRA vs Roth?

I donâ€™t know why this doesnâ€™t get mentioned more when this discussion comes up, but the limit for being able to take deductions for Traditional IRA contributions is fairly low if youâ€™re also covered by a retirement plan at work. For a single filer, itâ€™s currently $66k. Between $66k-$76k youâ€™re only allowed a partial deduction. So if youâ€™re above $76k, thereâ€™s no benefit to a Traditional if Roth is still an option for you.  At the same time, if your income is low a Roth is recommended since the tax savings from a Traditional isnâ€™t all that valuable. 

So, that leaves a middle zone where a Traditional might be more advantageous. What exactly is this zone? My first guess is the range where your income tax is 22% while still below the deduction limit, so around $40.5k-$66k. Between $66k-$76k, youâ€™d do a mix between Traditional and Roth as your partial deduction limit allows. Below $40.5k and above $76k would be Roth until itâ€™s no longer an option.

Does this sound like a reasonable strategy? Am I missing anything?

PS: it was hard to find since a lot of websites donâ€™t mention it, but the partial deduction formula is fairly simple. For a single filer, itâ€™s 60% of how far away you are from $76k. So if your MAGI is $70k, then youâ€™re allowed to deduct 0.6 * $6k, or $3600. So youâ€™d contribute $3600 to a Traditional and $2400 to a Roth.","Anchoring, Overconfidence, Confirmation Bias","The user exhibits Anchoring bias by initially guessing a specific income range ($40.5k-$66k) for choosing between Traditional and Roth IRAs, which may be influenced by the readily available information about the 22% income tax bracket.

For 2022 I suspect that I'll end up somewhere in the partially deductible traditional IRA range, so I'm trying to figure out what the best and easiest way to handle that will be. It's possible that I'm way over-thinking this, but I wanted to double check beforehand. Some options:

1. Contribute 6k to traditional IRA throughout the year, then recharacterize some to Roth when tax filing time comes. My problem is that I have no idea how easy or hard this is. Is it a lot of paperwork?

2. Wait until tax filing time to contribute. This is probably the easiest, but I'd lose out on a year's worth of growth.

3. Forget the whole thing and just put everything into a Roth. With the tIRA, I'd ultimately would be saving a few hundreds in taxes right now in exchange for paying those taxes in the future, after all. Maybe it's not worth the hassle?

Another consideration is that I currently only have a Roth IRA and, hopefully, my income will grow in years to come which means that a Roth would be better once I can no longer deduct Traditional IRA contributions anyway, so the tIRA account will probably end up with only a few thousands of contributions in it.

sl7fdv,Mountebank,"Job is asking for people to temporarily relocate to a new facility, but the benefits havenâ€™t been decided yet

My company recently opened a new location and theyâ€™re looking to transfer people to it temporarily. Itâ€™s going to be for a year or more.

Theyâ€™re promising a promotion at the end of the year and some sort of housing support, but the numbers arenâ€™t available yet.

Iâ€™m tentatively agreeable to this transfer. The new place is in a lower cost of living area, and if thereâ€™s a housing stipend then I can save money on rent.

If  hard numbers were available for the benefits then I could math it out, but theyâ€™re not. Then thereâ€™s the promotion to also take into account. That seems intangible to me since itâ€™s a startup and theyâ€™re making up the promotion ladder as they go so I have no idea what the rate increase for next rank would be.

My apartment complex has a deal where you could get a monthly parking pass for the municipal garage next door at a reduced rate.

Rent: : $1200/month. This is after my roommate and I split rent. I live in an extremely HCL area ): 

Food: $300. I don't know how much a single person eats, I know I don't eat very much and I have a lot of experience food shopping. This is my contribution to the household food items. It would probably be less if we both contribute to groceries. 

Utilities: $150/month. For all utilities like gas/water/electric/etc. Again, my contribution. Would probably be less. 

Gas(car): $240/month 

Phone: $90 

\*Loans: $300 

Fun money: $300

Left over: $554/month 

\*Loans: I currently pay $1400 a month to really knock down my loans. When I started making payments 6 months ago, I had $20,000 in loans. I currently have $8,800 left. I will be making $1400 payment until I move out (probably August/September) and I will probably have about $5,300 in loans left. I feel comfortable lowering my payments to $300, which will still be above the minimum. Extra money at the end of the month can go to my loans/savings. 

Savings account: I currently have $6,794 in my savings account. My job expenses my mileage to/from work as well as any tolls. All this money I get expended back to me goes into my savings account. I currently drive 100 miles a day going to work and back and moving will bring it down to about 50. So, every month we can estimate anywhere from $400-$600 dollars going into my savings. I have a goal of 10k. I will probably be at around 8k, maybe more, by the time I move out. I also have about a thousand in cash.

I've got the budget planned out and I think it will be manageable. I've got all the bases covered: rent, food, loans, renters insurance, utilities, 401k contributions, fun money, and horseback riding.

I tend to prefer doing things by pen and pencil, so I have been considering getting a notebook and keeping track that way. But, I feel like that could get old quick, and knowing myself, I will probably get lazy with it.

hvl3k0,Mtnrdr2,"How to save up for a house?

Hi all, 

I was wondering if anyone could offer any advice on how to save for a house. I am 24 years old and make $60k a year in a high CoL area. I currently live in an apartment with my roommate that I pay $1257 a month (an amazing price for where I live) which includes gas, water, heat, and garbage. I will probably live on my own for 3-4 years until I transfer to a different branch and will be closer to home and I will try to live at home for a year or two (2 min commute) until I can get a house but,I want a head start. My expenses are as follows:

I put 12% a paycheck a month towards my 401k. After taxes and 401k, I bring home $3000 a month. 

Rent:$1257
Internet: $13.5
Electricity: ~$40
Food: ~$250 
Netflix: $9
Gym(once it opens): ~$20
Phone (moms family plan): $90
Horseback riding: $200 
Vacation Fund: $120 

The rest I distribute to fun money, gas for car, shampoo/conditioner, etc. 

My mileage is expensed through my work. I usually get anywhere from $250-$600 a month in extra money that goes into an emergency fund. Right now, I currently have $7,600 in my savings account (1% interest, was 1.7%.. thanks covid). 
I have a goal of $10,000 in this account. By next pay check Iâ€™ll have about $8300 in there. 
Once this goal of 10k is reached, I would like to save up for a new car. I drive A LOT for my job, sometimes doing interstate travel (400+ miles away) and my car is old. A 2004 Camry with 175k on the engine. I had some engine problems recently, and although fine for driving around town,  I get nervous driving it long distance now and borrow my moms car. Iâ€™d like to get one, probably another Camry, that I can feel more comfortable in driving long distance for work. 

I feel like I have my finances under control atm. However, buying a house is a HUGE investment and I know nothing about it other than having 20% for down payment that Iâ€™ve just been able to start thinking about since my parents paid off the remaining of my loans, as a surprise, ($7800) after I already paid off $12,000. Any advice and guidance would really be helpful.","Mental Accounting, Present Bias","The user exhibits Mental Accounting by dividing their money into separate accounts for different purposes, such as a vacation fund, emergency fund, and 401k, and treating them differently.

kdo3oh,Mtnrdr2,"Question about yearly income and W2?

Hi all,
This is my first salary job so Iâ€™m not sure how this works. My salary for the year is $60,000, which is says at the top of my paystubs. Looking at the most recent paystub I have, it says that I get $2316.97 biweekly before taxes. My year to date income is $56,552.98. This includes things like ldt and std, and also my two bonuses which added up to $2500. If you take out the $2500 bonus, my year to date is $54,052.98. I get paid biweekly and my next paycheck is this coming Friday of $2316.97 before taxes, which brings my total for the year to $56,369.95 (without bonuses) and $58,868 (with bonuses). This will be the last paycheck of the year since two weeks after this Friday is January 1st. So my question is, where is this extra $3630.05 (without bonus) or $1132 (with bonus)?  

The only thing I could think of was that I started January 6th of this year. But, when I looked at the paystub for when I started, the cycle went from January 4th to the 17th and I got paid my full paycheck. So, Iâ€™d be missing $700 if I started on January 1st.

Im a bit at a loss at what to do, my mother just approached me with some information yesterday. She has a life insurance plan that she pays monthly. The life insurance plan is the kind that, after a long period, the cash value ends up being higher than the total premiums paid.    
She started the plan in 2002, and has paid a $150 monthly premium since. The coverage is for $150K death benefit, and maturity date is 2060, so long after sheâ€™ll pass.

17c0l2b,Mujased,"Low Income / Retirement Housing Advice needed

(California).   
So my parents will be retiring in 3-5 years. At that point, they will probably sell their home and begin renting.       
My hope for them is to get into low income housing, retirement housing, or a combination of the two.          
They are both blue collar workers, and do not make much, roughly $30K a year together. They have zero retirement accounts. They will be drawing a total of $2040/mo from Social Security once they retire.      
They do however, own 80% of their home (100K mortgage left on a $500K condo).    
They also have $30,000 in their bank account, and $100K in treasury bills. The treasury bills consist of $75,000 of their savings, and $25,000 from myself, for a total of $100,000. This is put into 4 4 week treasury bills that are laddered currently.            
I am wondering how to prepare for the eventual change in housing. I am most concerned about asset issues, as on paper, they will have quite a bit.         
I canâ€™t imagine the interest from whatever they put into bills or bonds between now and then being more than 5K for any given year, so their total income will be roughly still $30,000.
Anyone have any tips or advice on what I should do right now to help them prepare?","Mental Accounting, Anchoring","The user's statement reveals two potential biases. Firstly, the user is treating the $25,000 contributed by themselves as separate from the rest of the parents' savings, as evident from the explicit mention of the amount and its origin. This indicates Mental Accounting, where the user is compartmentalizing the funds, potentially leading to suboptimal decision-making. Secondly, the user is anchoring on the current income level of $30,000 per year, projecting it into the future and assuming that the interest income from the treasury bills will be relatively insignificant, capping it at $5,000 per year. This Anchoring bias may lead the user to overlook potential changes in interest rates or investment returns.",The user is exhibiting biased decision-making behavior by compartmentalizing funds and relying on current income levels to estimate future financial situations.

The user is simply inquiring about the appropriateness of discussing lease information with other tenants in the same shopping plaza, triggered by a conversation with another business owner who received a significant increase in CAM (Common Area Maintenance) charges.

The fact that they are mentally separating their savings into distinct categories (e.g., ""savings"" and ""home purchase"") rather than considering their overall financial situation and optimal allocation of resources may indicate Mental Accounting.

Currently trying to help a family friend out. They have no savings or retirement funds, and so I want to help them set up at least something right now.    
They are filing their taxes right now, and their total income was $189K, while their total expenses totaled 168K.   
Given that the net income is around 21K, is it a good idea for them to put 7K towards an IRA? Or is there a better option?
They have averaged around 25K in net income for the past 30 years.","Mental Accounting, Present Bias","The statement reveals that the sole-proprietor has a low net income of $21K, yet the advisor is considering allocating $7K towards an IRA, which is approximately one-third of their net income. This decision may be influenced by Mental Accounting, as the advisor is separating the income into different mental accounts (e.g., income for living expenses and income for retirement savings). Additionally, the advisor is prioritizing long-term retirement savings over the immediate needs of the sole-proprietor, which may be driven by Present Bias, where the advisor is overvaluing the future benefits of retirement savings over the present needs of the individual.","The advisor is exhibiting a bias towards prioritizing long-term savings goals over immediate financial needs, potentially neglecting the sole-proprietor's current financial constraints."
