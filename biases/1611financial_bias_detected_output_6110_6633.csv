tysdtp,TrustyBagOfPlaylists,"Could someone help me understand spirit of the emergency fund?

I donâ€™t know.  But, in my mind, the emergency fund is there to help for job-loss or short-term needs.  As a non-home-owner, the biggest short term need I had is something like a car emergency.

Common-thinking seems to be that an emergency fund should cover 3-6 months expenses.  Common-thinking also seems to conclude that these funds should be kept in a bank account.  Iâ€™m asking why these funds need to, exclusively, come from a bank account.

I know there are circumstances where you might need some funds IMMEDIATELY.  But do those circumstances really require 3-6 months expenses?  If 6 months expenses would equate to $12k, why canâ€™t some of those funds me kept in iBonds past their year-long requirement?

w43r5x,TrustyBagOfPlaylists,"Time for a state of the union. Applaud where itâ€™s due; stay silent where itâ€™s due.

Iâ€™m a single 38m.  My route to this point has been unconventional.  I work a state government job in TN.

I make ~$53.5k/yrâ€¦but had been making ~$47.4k/yr my first 2 years in this job.  My living situation had been so financially beneficial that I never bothered to do the incrementals.  But things are changing.  Iâ€™m moving to a more rural area to save money on transportation/commute.  However the lack of roommates and overall increase in rent is taking my cost of living up a few notches.

With the rent Iâ€™m looking at, it would be 21.5% of my gross and 30.5% of my take-home.  If I include utilities in that, Iâ€™ll be spending 26% gross and 37% of my take home.

That means that my savings will now be only 22% of my gross.  And that would move down to 14.5% of gross once I start paying on my student loans again.

I should clarify that I currently contribute 6% of my gross to a retirement account (matched at 5% to my 2% contribution +$100/mo).  Iâ€™m also invested in a state pension that would pay out 1% final income * number of years worked per year post retirement.

w9tsg6,TrustyBagOfPlaylists,"Am I being pedantic with this property management company?

I have to move and am trying to rent in a small town in Tennessee.  Thereâ€™s basically no new development.  But, recently, an investor purchased some old brick triplexes close to a community college and is revamping them.  Apparently, they began this process while current tenants were living there and communicated that they were essentially doubling the rent.

This is a town of less than 10k people outside of Knoxville, tn.  Advertised on their website and on Zillow were apartments listed at 950/mo for a one bedroom and 1050/mo for a two bedroom.  After expressing intent to sign, it was communicated to me that 1 BRâ€™s were 975 and 2 BRâ€™s were 1100.  They framed this by referencing some county utility issues that required water and sewer to be split between two utility companies.  They were including sewer cost in the $975/$1100 rents (but apparently not in their advertisements?)

Referencing the advertisements, their primary booking agent put me on hold to talk to her boss.  And she came back telling me itâ€™s actually $1k for the 1BR and $1.1k for the 2.  I tell her I have to consider my previous statement that Iâ€™d  run numbers while she reached out to the owner.

After talking, she seems proud of herself and tells me she got the owner to agree to $975 even though previous 1BRâ€™s were rented at $1k.  So, I agree to the 1 BR and wait for the lease to be emailed my way.  Once received, the leaseâ€™s utility section makes no mention of this.  Not only does it not mention sewer being included in the rent, but no mention of trash pickup (which is supposed to be included as well).  Iâ€™ve sent first months rent+deposit as a sign of good faith.  But I said I canâ€™t sign the lease until I receive written (emailed) confirmation that trash and sewer are included in the listed rent.

Monthly spending is a no-brainer.  Itâ€™s so easy to set aside a certain amount each month for rent, groceries, gas, internet/cell, etc.

Iâ€™m not someone whoâ€™s well-off comparatively.  Iâ€™m a single, 38 year old making ~$55k in a government job in a low cost of living area.

I have significant student debt of &gt;$100k that Iâ€™ve been paying on for  10 of my 13 years out of school.  I will qualify for PSLF forgiveness after 4 more years of government work.

With the generous math, Iâ€™m saving 16% for retirement (5% pension, 6% 401k contribution, 5% company 401k match).  I save another 26-27%.

1. Free childcare/pre-K. Can save a family about $15000 per year per child. Just cross the border to drop your child off to childcare/Pre-K every day.
2. Free healthcare. You don't need to buy health insurance for your child, as you could just cross the border for doctors appointments. This will probably save another $3k a year. This is from birth until age 26
3. Don't need to start a college fund for your child (since college in Canada is much more affordable)

- Throughout the month, I pay off my CC bill from my checking account. It's very unlikely that I would spend $1000 in two weeks, but if I need to for whatever reason, I would withdraw from the emergency fund to pay off the bill and then replenish the emergency fund when I next get paid

After taxes, I brought in $2,894.22. My total spending was $2,399.58. So I am in the green but not by much. I am worried that I am spending too much - there's no way I would be able to afford to live if I wasn't with my parents. I am lucky enough to a lot in savings and a big emergency fund but I would be draining my savings if I had to pay for rent, a car insurance without being on my parents' plan, utility bills, etc. I think the man issue is the groceries &amp; home category but I don't really know how to tackle that. I have no idea where the money is going - I just put it on my credit card and it all shows as Walmart. I think I am going to try and start splitting it up into food on one credit card and everything else on another card but I won't get as much cash back on the other stuff and it won't narrow it down too much. Can anyone tell me if my spending seems reasonable and give some tips on reducing it?

xaeudz,USD_bussin,"Can anyone help sanity check my budget? I want to be saving more but I don't see any spending categories to cut

A while back I posted asking for one of these sanity checks and I got a lot of advice. It felt very harsh at the time but it was definitely the wake up call I needed. I set up YNAB and I'm tracking everything in there. I set up my categories based on my spending from the time and since then I've adjusted them as needed based on my spending in months since then.

I currently live with my parents so I have tons of money to do whatever I want with, either saving or spending, and I am trying to use this time in my life to build good habits so they stick with me for the rest of life when things get less forgiving and I won't have my parents as a safety blanket anymore. Not just for finance, I've been trying to cut calories and exercise more and also improve my sleep schedule. Reducing the number of unhealthy snacks and meals out I have been eating definitely helped a lot with my food budget.

Anyway here are my YNAB categories. I'm looking for a sanity check on the actual amounts or some suggestions on how to improve the way I group transactions as well.

- Groceries: $250/mo (down from $400 - really proud of this!)
- Rent: $180/mo
- Gym membership: $18 per month ($15/mo + $50 AF)
- Household (soap, shampoo, floss, toothpaste, etc.): $50/mo
- Car maintenance: $25/mo, but any leftover gets added to the next months budget, so if I don't have any maintenance in the first 2 months I have $75 for maintenance in the 3rd month.
- Gas: $200/mo, this seems to have gone down considerably in recent months due to gas price changes. My commute to work is 24mi round trip and my car gets 24mpg.
- Car insurance: $450 every 6 months
- Car registration fees: $150/year
- Restaurants: $100/mo - I have completely stopped eating out on my own but I go out with my friends every Friday and $25/meal is a pretty good average for this.
- Miscellaneous fun things: $200/mo, I do the same thing as car maintenance so I add $200 to this account every month regardless of how much I spend the last month. I have been averaging under $200 spent each month but I want to keep putting money in here for big ticket items.
- Donations: $10/mo, usually goes to charity or YouTube creators
- Password manager subscription: $10/year
- Google drive subscription: $10/mo
- YNAB: $15/mo
- Savings for gifts/holidays: I have 3 family members and I have decided to save $150 for each of their birthdays, plus $350 for Christmas, so $500/year or $42/mo
- Short term savings (basically an emergency fund but this is also the money I would use for a situation like I'm moving out and need to pay for furniture, deposit, etc. It's got quite a bit of money in it so I should have plenty of an EF even if I needed to spend a large portion on stuff like the apartment expenses mentioned): $500/mo
- Long term savings (invested in safe long term investments, plan to use in 10+ years from now on something like a house down payment): $1000/mo

Any remaining money will go towards savings or just hang out in my bank account.

The total of all the categories added up (not including savings) is about $1200. That is way lower than it used to be and I'm happy about that but it still seems high since I live with my parents and only have to pay for food and gas.

My income is about $3k/mo but it will differ based on hours worked and overtime.

After paying off our credit cards each month and paying rent each month, we have about $8K-$10K left over each month. The question is -- what to do with this money? We were planning to just keep adding to that ""whatever fund"" but more than $100K just sitting seems silly right? Other than the down payment and the emergency fund, I don't see a need for us to be so liquid.

I already max out my traditional 401k and make above the Roth IRA income limit. Let's say I have $6k that I want to put toward retirement. My two options are: 

1) Backdoor Roth IRA ($6K max) -- I would invest $6K in January then do the whole conversion mechanism through Fidelity. 

2) Mega Backdoor Roth 401k ($40,500 max) -- In addition to a traditional 401(k), my employer allows for after-tax contributions into a Roth 401k directly from your paycheck. Fidelity handles the conversion automatically each paycheck. (I know I could convert the after-tax contributions to a Roth IRA instead but my employer has great 401(k) options so I'm not concerned).

So between the two, is there a better option? I'm leaning toward the Mega Backdoor Roth 401k route simply because there's zero work on my end.

Simply put to be competitive in the electric car market it requires a lot less workers and lower wages. Electric cars are just simpler mechanically and require less work to build.

Historically Germany's unions have been adept at reading market conditions and working to create competitive vehicles rather than just maximize wages.

TL;DR: Even if they settle the current lawsuits for only $10b, they could still be liable in the future from cases brought by people buying Roundup today.

&gt; Experts have said Bayer is in an unusual position compared with other companies that have faced multibillion-dollar lawsuits over their products. To end mass-tort litigation, other companies generally have discontinued or altered their products or added warning labelsâ€”all of which are problematic for the German pharmaceutical and agricultural company.

&gt;Bayer AG said it agrees with a move from attorneys representing plaintiffs who sued over the safety of its Roundup weedkiller to withdraw a motion seeking court approval for a plan covering how future claims related to the product would be resolved.  
&gt;  
&gt;That motion is part of [a $10.9 billion settlement](https://www.wsj.com/articles/bayer-reaches-10-5-billion-settlement-over-weedkiller-roundup-11593017309) the German pharmaceutical and agriculture conglomerate reached in June to settle tens of thousands of lawsuits with U.S. plaintiffs who have alleged the Roundup herbicide causes cancer.  
&gt;  
&gt;A spokesman for Bayer confirmed the company agreed with attorneys for the plaintiffs to pull back on the motion. Bayer has said it would set aside $1.25 billion to work toward resolving future claims, which would be guided by conclusions from a court-approved panel of scientists who studied Roundupâ€™s potential carcinogenicity.

&gt;  
&gt;â€œBayer remains strongly committed to a resolution that simultaneously addresses both the current litigation on reasonable terms and a viable solution to manage and resolve potential future litigation,â€ the company said in a statement on Wednesday.

&amp;#x200B;

Bayer really wants to have the lawsuit behind them, so they're willing to do a $10.9 billion settlement to do so.

&amp;#x200B;

However, one of the issues is that Bayer plans to continue to use Roundup because Bayer, the FDA, and EU all claim it is safe.  So they're paying a $10.9 billion settlement for harm done to people who use Roundup, which they is safe.

As part of the deal they wanted to put $1.25 billion towards all future lawsuits.  Part of the $1.25 billion would go towards a court appointed scientific panel that would be used in deciding if Roundup was safe or not for the purposes of future claims.

Additionally, the company's plan to continue selling Roundup and their initial attempt to settle future claims through a $1.25 billion fund and a court-appointed scientific panel suggest a Status Quo Bias, as they want to maintain their current business practices.

From the [WSJ](https://www.wsj.com/articles/eu-leaders-close-in-on-coronavirus-recovery-plan-deal-11595274568?mod=hp_lead_pos1)

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;European Union leaders agreed on a â‚¬1.8 trillion ($2.06 trillion) spending package aimed at containing an [unprecedented economic downturn](https://www.wsj.com/articles/eurozone-economy-suffers-record-contraction-steeper-than-u-s-11588242162) by resorting to new measures that could ultimately deepen the blocâ€™s economic integration.  
&gt;  
&gt;The package, built around the blocâ€™s first-ever issuance of hundreds of billions of euros of common debt, came together early Tuesday after four days of talks among the blocâ€™s 27 leadersâ€”the blocâ€™s longest summit in 20 years. German Chancellor Angela Merkel and French President Emmanuel Macron were forced to compromise on what would be spent and how much would be handed out in grants.  
&gt;  
&gt;Leaders ultimately agreed on a â‚¬750 billion recovery plan. Of that, â‚¬390 billion will be offered in grants and the rest will come in the form of loans. That is down from â‚¬500 billion recently proposed by Brussels. The leaders also agreed on a multiyear EU budget of over â‚¬1 trillion that will run from next year to 2027.  
&gt;  
&gt;â€œWe did it. Europe is strong. Europe is united,â€ European Council President Charles Michel, who hosted the summit, said in a press conference Tuesday morning. â€œThese were of course difficult negotiations in very difficult times for all Europeans. This is a good deal. This is a strong deal.â€  
&gt;  
&gt;The agreement represents a significant step in the EUâ€™s move toward a more genuine fiscal union. Some have hailed it as the [blocâ€™s Hamiltonian moment](https://www.wsj.com/articles/hamilton-is-hot-in-europe-the-debt-policy-not-the-musical-11592493271), referring to Alexander Hamilton, the first U.S. Treasury secretary, who had the federal government absorb the debts of U.S. states. Some economists, however, say the cash may only make a modest difference to revive depressed economies.  
&gt;  
&gt;The EU deal will need to be approved by the parliaments of member states, which could prove contentious. Under the recovery plan, the European Commission, the EUâ€™s executive branch, will for the first time issue debt on a large scale to fund grants and loans for countries hit hard by the coronavirus pandemic.  
&gt;  
&gt;The aim is partly to boost Europeâ€™s economic recovery from the new year, while allowing Italy, Spain, Greece and others to increase government spending now without fearing that already high national debt will rise to unsustainable levels.  
&gt;  
&gt;Without the bailout plan, Italyâ€™s national debt risks ballooning to a level that could endanger the euro. Wealthier northern countries decided that helping Rome now was preferable to facing a currency crisis later. The recovery plan grants must be paid out by 2023 and loans allocated by then. Repayments will take place over decades, ending in 2058, leaders agreed.  
&gt;  
&gt;Even with the new agreement, the eurozoneâ€™s economy will shrink by up to 9% this year, according to several estimates, before rebounding somewhat next year. While EU unemployment sparked by the crisis has been abated by government support programs, many economists predict an upsurge later this year as those measures expire.  
&gt;  
&gt;European economies have resumed activity in recent weeks, following a three-month induced coma to squelch the pandemic. But significant portions of the EU economy remain moribund, most notably [tourism and related service businesses](https://www.wsj.com/articles/europes-tourist-hot-spots-suffer-as-u-s-big-spenders-are-told-to-stay-away-11594132862). World-wide [travel bans](https://www.wsj.com/articles/eu-opens-up-to-some-travelers-but-not-americans-11593524652) mean that the normally vast numbers of Asian and American visitors who each summer pump billions of euros into the EU arenâ€™t coming this year, exacerbating woes in Southern European countries reliant on tourism.  
&gt;  
&gt;Alongside the recovery plan, the regular trillion-euro EU budget will pump money into infrastructure and other types of public investment starting next year, while helping the bloc meet its ambitious climate targets. The bloc has already agreed to a â‚¬540 billion coronavirus emergency package of loans to governments and businesses and funding for job-support plans.  
&gt;  
&gt;Tuesdayâ€™s agreement represented a revival of the postwar Franco-German alliance, which had flagged over recent years, with Ms. Merkel having repeatedly rebuffed Mr. Macronâ€™s push for deeper economic integration in the eurozone.  
&gt;  
&gt;â€œI think itâ€™s a very important message to the rest of Europeâ€”but also beyond Europe, that this very special entity, this very special construct of 27 member states of the European Union...is actually able to act together and has proven that it is able to act together,â€ said Ms. Merkel in a press conference alongside Mr. Macron.  
&gt;  
&gt;Yet others expressed disappointment that the planâ€™s ambition was reduced by a group of fiscally conservative countriesâ€”led by the Netherlandsâ€”that had wanted a plan focused around loans, not grants. Those countries argued the plan risked turning the EU into a wealth-transfer union that would bolster domestic euroskeptic opposition and could breach current rules.  
&gt;  
&gt;After the deal was secured Tuesday morning, Dutch Prime Minister Mark Rutte said the recovery plan wouldnâ€™t convert the EU into a wealth-transfer union because the Netherlands and its allies had ensured it was a time-limited, one-off program launched for the health crisis.  
&gt;  
&gt;Meanwhile Italian Prime Minister Giuseppe Conteâ€”who clashed with Mr. Rutte over the size of the grants and the conditions to be attached to loansâ€”said the accord, despite the reduced amount of grants, was a major step forward.  
&gt;  
&gt;â€œWe are satisfied we have launched an ambitious recovery plan,â€ he told reporters. â€œItâ€™s a historic moment for Europe. Itâ€™s a historic moment for Italy.â€  
&gt;  
&gt;Because of the coronavirus, the summit was the first in-person meeting of EU leaders since February. Extensive measures were taken to prevent it from turning into a super-spreading event, but as talks wore on, fatigued leaders put aside social-distancing and mask-wearing instructions in a push for a deal.  
&gt;  
&gt;After a Friday morning start, negotiations nearly broke down that evening. There were tense exchanges after dinner Saturday between France and Germany and the Dutch-led group, and several leaders rounded on Mr. Rutte, the Dutch prime minister, during Sunday nightâ€™s discussions. However, around dawn Monday, an agreement was reached on the amount of grants that should be given under the plan. Once that fight was settled, the rest of the package fell into place.  
&gt;  
&gt;Mr. Rutte also insisted that member states be allowed to hold up payments to other countries if they donâ€™t push economic reform plans. Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban opposed plans to link some EU budget spending to a member countryâ€™s upholding of democratic principles.  
&gt;  
&gt;As in past years, a deal was made possible only after the EU shelved some of its more ambitious, long-term spending plans on issues like the digital economy, security and defense and migration. Despite EU efforts to gradually kill off the special budget repayments enjoyed by a few countries, the final package saw the Netherlands, Sweden, Denmark and Austria walk away with larger so-called rebates.","Framing Effect, Anchoring, Loss Aversion, Herd Behavior","The article about European Union leaders agreeing on a spending plan for recovery reveals several biases. The Framing Effect is present in how the plan is presented, with leaders like European Council President Charles Michel framing it as a ""good deal"" and ""a strong deal,"" which influences perception by emphasizing the positive aspects. Anchoring is evident with the mention of a â‚¬500 billion proposal by Brussels, which serves as an anchor for the final agreement of â‚¬390 billion in grants, making the final amount seem more reasonable by comparison. Loss Aversion can be inferred in the discussions around the plan, where countries like Italy see the grants as essential to prevent their national debt from ballooning, indicating a fear of loss (economic downturn) driving their support for the plan. Lastly, Herd Behavior is observed in how the agreement signifies a revival of the post-war Franco-German alliance, suggesting that other countries are following the lead of influential members like Germany and France in supporting the economic integration.","The user's overall biasing behavior tends to lean towards positively framed economic agreements and significant spending packages influenced by key leaders, reflecting a susceptibility to framing, anchoring, loss aversion, and herd behavior."

With remote work continuing, I don't think people are going to want to completely give up all the amenities that come with living in a city.

i17cbh,VCUBNFO,"Eurozone Economy Contracts by Record 40%

[From the WSJ](https://www.wsj.com/articles/eurozone-economy-contracts-by-record-40-11596191720?mod=hp_lead_pos2)

&gt;Stringent lockdowns weighed heavily on Europeâ€™s economy in the second quarter, causing a record decline that was even more severe than in the U.S., but the continentâ€™s strategy of containment coupled with aggressive stimulus is fanning hopes of a robust recovery.  
&gt;  
&gt;The eurozoneâ€™s gross domestic product fell 40.3% annually in the three months through June, exceeding the U.S. economyâ€™s 32.9% contraction, according to data published Friday. That is by far the sharpest decline since comparable records began in 1995, according to the European Unionâ€™s statistics agency.  
&gt;  
&gt;However, recent statistics suggest Europe is having a â€œmuch bigger snapback and there are some indicators that it may be getting ahead \[of the U.S.\],â€ said Holger Schmieding, chief economist at Berenberg Bank.  
&gt;  
&gt;The U.S. economy is being supported by a massive fiscal stimulus that will likely translate into a 2020 government budget deficit roughly twice as large as Europeâ€™s, Mr. Schmieding added.  
&gt;  
&gt;â€œThe U.S. is paying with fiscal stimulus for its failure to tackle the pandemic decisively,â€ he said.  
&gt;  
&gt;While the U.S. grapples with tens of thousands of new infections each day, Europe has largely brought the virus under control, even as it has eased restrictions and reopened internal borders, notwithstanding an increase in cases in countries such as France and Spain.  
&gt;  
&gt;Confidence appears to be gaining among European consumers and businesses, supported by the billions that governments have lavished on job-protection schemes, aggressive stimulus from the European Central Bank, and a groundbreaking â‚¬1.8 trillion ($2.1 trillion) spending package unveiled by EU leaders last week.  
&gt;  
&gt;The EU stimulus will push up economic growth in Greece, long one of the continentâ€™s weakest performers, by about 2 percentage points a year for the next six years, the countryâ€™s central bank governor, Yannis Stournaras, said.  
&gt;  
&gt;â€œIt was something unexpected, so this is going to have a very positive impact on the Greek economy,â€ Mr. Stournaras said this week.  
&gt;  
&gt;The euro has been on a tear against the dollar in recent weeks, rising close to a two-year high. That reflects both investorsâ€™ confidence in Europe and the U.S.â€™s uneven progress in halting fresh virus infections.  
&gt;  
&gt;â€œThe business in Europe has been and currently is stronger than in the U.S.,â€ BjÃ¸rn Gulden, chief executive of German sports-goods maker Puma SE, told reporters Wednesday. In the U.S., demand has varied widely from state to state, he said.  
&gt;  
&gt;However, analysts at Commerzbank expect the U.S. to remain ahead, with its economy seen contracting by 4.5% for 2020 overall, versus 7% in the eurozone. The U.S. economy will likely grow by 4% in 2021, compared with 5% for the eurozone, they said.  
&gt;  
&gt;Lakshmi Mittal, CEO of ArcelorMittal, the worldâ€™s largest steelmaker, said that according to his order books, the U.S. was pulling slightly ahead.  
&gt;  
&gt;â€œThe U.S. is recovering faster than Europe, we are seeing that from our customer bases,â€ Mr. Mittal said, attributing this primarily to American auto makers.  
&gt;  
&gt;Europe still faces challenges. The region is highly dependent on exports and tourism, neither of which will recover fully until the virus is under control around the world. In Southern Europe, businesses tend to be smaller and more vulnerable, and governments need to service debts that have been inflated by the mammoth costs of containing the pandemic.  
&gt;  
&gt;Borrowing costs have so far been kept in check by aggressive government-bond purchases by the ECB, but central-bank officials have stressed that support is only temporary.  
&gt;  
&gt;Pockets of infection are resurfacing, including in northeastern Spain, dealing a blow to the nationâ€™s large tourism sector. Foreign tourism makes up around 14% of GDP in Greece, 12% in Portugal and 8% in Spain, according to research firm Capital Economics.  
&gt;  
&gt;Tourists are staying away, with occupancy rates of holiday accommodation below 30% in Italy, Greece and Spain. Spain lost one million jobs between April and June, its biggest ever quarterly decline, and the unemployment rate rose to a two-year high of 15.3%, official data indicated Tuesday.  
&gt;  
&gt;That is widening the divide between Europeâ€™s industry-rich North and its poorer South, whose economies had to contend with a worse health crisis, a deeper economic collapse and high debts that deter intensive stimulus. Spainâ€™s economy contracted by 18.5% in the second quarter versus the previous three months, and Italyâ€™s by 12.4%, as Madrid and Rome imposed some of the worldâ€™s strictest lockdowns.  
&gt;  
&gt;Germanyâ€™s economy performed better, shrinking by 10.1%, due to a relatively light lockdown and aggressive government spending.  
&gt;  
&gt;McDonaldâ€™s Corp CEO Chris Kempczinski said Tuesday he saw strong opportunities in Europe, â€œwhere I think there may be some independent restaurant units that are having some bigger challenges.â€  
&gt;  
&gt;He added that: â€œIn many markets around the world, most notably in the U.S., the public-health situation appears to be worsening.â€  
&gt;  
&gt;In France, the EUâ€™s second-largest economy, consumer confidence unexpectedly dropped in July amid signs of a rebound in Covid-19 infections, a monthly survey suggested Wednesday. The French economy contracted by 13.8% in the second quarter versus the previous three months amid weak exports and household consumption, official data showed on Friday.  
&gt;  
&gt;Still, recent French data suggest â€œa V-shaped recovery is on the cards for the third quarter,â€ said Julien Manceaux, an economist with ING Bank.  
&gt;  
&gt;Europeâ€™s governments face a challenge in how to withdraw massive emergency support measures like job-furlough schemes and credit guarantees without hurting the economic recovery. These programs are costly and over time they could keep alive businesses and jobs that should disappear, but governments canâ€™t immediately pull the plug, said Marion Amiot, an economist with S&amp;P Global Ratings in London.  
&gt;  
&gt;But recent mobility data from Google suggest that Europeans are currently more willing to shop than Americans. Some European households have accumulated savings that they can now spend, since many were paid but confined to their homes, said Ms. Amiot.  
&gt;  
&gt;In Italy, business confidence rose in June, with more private firms at any time since late 2018 expecting an increase in profit over the next year, according to IHS Markit.  
&gt;  
&gt;Fiat Chrysler Automobiles NV has been ramping up production over the past few months after completely shutting down its factories in mid-March as Italy battled what at the time was the worldâ€™s worst coronavirus outbreak. About three-fourths of employees in production who were working at the end of February are back in the factories. Several of the companyâ€™s large Italian assembly plants, including one in the deep South that produces the Jeep Renegade and Compass as well as the Fiat 500X crossover, are working at full capacity.  
&gt;  
&gt;Volkswagen AG sales chief, Christian Dahlheim, said Thursday there was a clear positive trend in Western Europe as restrictions loosened and car dealerships reopened. In Germany, order entries for June were above last year, he said.  
&gt;  
&gt;The recovery is less pronounced in the U.S. than in Europe, partly because demand there didnâ€™t collapse quite as dramatically as in Europe during the shutdowns, Mr. Dahlheim said.","Confirmation Bias, Recency Bias, Affect Heuristic","The article presents a mixed picture of the economic recovery in Europe and the US, but the overall tone seems to be more optimistic about Europe's prospects. The quotes from various economists and business leaders, such as Holger Schmieding, Bjørn Gulden, and Chris Kempczinski, suggest that Europe is experiencing a stronger recovery, while the US is facing challenges. This selective presentation of information, focusing on the positive aspects of Europe's recovery and the challenges faced by the US, indicates Confirmation Bias. Additionally, the emphasis on recent positive data and trends in Europe, such as the ""much bigger snapback"" and improving business confidence, suggests Recency Bias, where the author is giving more weight to recent information. The overall positive tone and emphasis on Europe's recovery also indicate the Affect Heuristic, where the author's emotional response to the data is influencing their interpretation.","The user exhibits a biasing behavior characterized by selectively presenting information that confirms their optimistic view of Europe's economic recovery while downplaying the US's prospects, and overemphasizing recent positive trends."

[From the WSJ](https://www.wsj.com/articles/lyft-to-suspend-service-in-california-11597942614?mod=hp_lead_pos2)

&gt;[Lyft](https://www.wsj.com/market-data/quotes/LYFT) Inc. LYFT said Thursday[ it will suspend operations in California](https://www.lyft.com/blog/posts/ca-operations-update) as of midnight, to avoid violating an order that requires it to immediately reclassify its drivers as employees.  
&gt;  
&gt;California sued and Lyft and [Uber Technologies](https://www.wsj.com/market-data/quotes/UBER) Inc. in May, alleging they were violating the law, which requires companies to treat workers as employees rather than independent contractors if they are controlled by their employer and contribute to its usual course of business, among other things. As employees, drivers would be eligible for sick days and other benefits, issues that have become more pressing during [the coronavirus pandemic](https://www.wsj.com/news/collection/coronavirus-6dcf2a21).  
&gt;  
&gt;Uber and Lyft, both based in San Francisco, have argued that they are technology platforms connecting riders with drivers, not transportation companies, so the drivers arenâ€™t part of their usual course of business.  
&gt;  
&gt;A state judge agreed with California last week and gave the companies [until Friday to reclassify their drivers](https://www.wsj.com/articles/uber-and-lyft-threaten-california-shutdown-heres-whats-at-stake-11597847808) as employees.

My favorite quote was

&gt;Our customers spend about one hour a day in their car and one hour a day away from their phone. Any car maker who tries to create an ecosystem around the car deserves to lose the customer,â€ says Martin Kristensson, head of digital business at Volvo Cars.

&amp;#x200B;

From the [WSJ](https://www.wsj.com/articles/the-german-car-industry-musters-for-a-new-tech-battle-11602245653?mod=hp_lista_pos3)

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;Is the heart of your car a screen?  
&gt;  
&gt;Having spent yearsâ€”and tens of billions of dollarsâ€”preparing for a shift in production toward electric vehicles, German car makers are expressing a new angst: that digitally â€œconnected carsâ€ could prove even more disruptive to their traditional strengths. This second leg of their race against Tesla could become a fresh excuse to squander investorsâ€™ capital.  
&gt;  
&gt;Daimler set two priorities for technological leadership in a new strategy for its [Mercedes-Benz](https://www.wsj.com/market-data/quotes/DMLRY) [DMLRY **-0.55%** ](https://www.wsj.com/market-data/quotes/DMLRY?mod=chiclets)brand this week: electric drive and car software. For the latter, the company is working on an entire operating system, MB.OS, that from 2024 will run not just Mercedesâ€™s proprietary infotainment system and its mobile broadband connection but also crucial elements of the driving experience, including self-driving features and battery management.  
&gt;  
&gt;The company will partner with technology specialists for specific applications, notably [Nvidia](https://www.wsj.com/market-data/quotes/NVDA) for automated driving. Yet the closer the software gets to the customer experience, the more Daimler wants to do in-house. The interface with the driver in particular â€œis not something that we would like to outsource to somebody else,â€ said Chief Executive Ola KÃ¤llenius.  
&gt;  
&gt;[Volkswagen](https://www.wsj.com/market-data/quotes/XE/XETR/VOW) [VOW **+0.00%** ](https://www.wsj.com/market-data/quotes/XE/XETR/VOW?mod=chiclets)is on a similar road. At last weekâ€™s annual general meeting, Chief Executive Herbert Diess said replacing engines with electric batteries and motors would be simple to manage compared with the transformation of the car into a â€œfully networked mobility device.â€ He is tackling the challenge by investing heavily in coding: VW wants to increase the proportion of software written in-house to at least 60%, from 10% currently, at a cost of â‚¬7 billion, equivalent to $8.23 billion, by 2025.  
&gt;  
&gt;The shadow haunting the German automotive industry is, of course, Tesla. Mr. Diess regularly spurs on his managers by invoking the U.S. companyâ€™s technological lead and astronomical market value. The starring role accorded to the infotainment screen in a Tesla seems to be a popular feature with the kind of tech-loving consumers who might otherwise buy an [Audi](https://www.wsj.com/market-data/quotes/XE/XETR/NSU). Auto makers are also envious of Teslaâ€™s capacity to keep consumersâ€™ systems fresh via â€œover-the-airâ€ updates.  
&gt;  
&gt;One reason Daimler cited for focusing on software was the scope for using this kind of live digital connection with its customers to sell them services well after they have bought their Mercedes-Benz. Many manufacturers have talked of this potential, but Daimler was bold enough to pin a number on it: It hopes to make â‚¬1 billion in operating profit from digital services by 2025.  
&gt;  
&gt;The software industry has been through a wrenching transition over the past decade from selling one-off packages to subscriptions for access to a constantly updated, cloud-hosted service. As more vehicles are connected to the internet, infotainment systems are likely next in line. One big unknown is what consumers will be prepared to pay for, and who will get itâ€”vehicle manufacturers or software developers. Another is how deeply the infotainment system will end up being linked to driving controls.  
&gt;  
&gt;For now, though, most car makers are more relaxed than Daimler and VW about ceding control of at least infotainment to the tech industry. [General Motors](https://www.wsj.com/market-data/quotes/GM), Volvo Cars, the Renault-Nissan-Mitsubishi [alliance](https://www.wsj.com/articles/google-to-partner-with-biggest-car-alliance-1537243260) and [Peugeot](https://www.wsj.com/market-data/quotes/PUGOY) (which [Fiat-Chrysler](https://www.wsj.com/market-data/quotes/FCAU) will likely follow) [all are partnering to varying extents](https://www.wsj.com/articles/gmturns-togooglefor-in-car-apps-voice-commands-11567692000) with Alphabetâ€™s Google, which has developed a vehicle version of its smartphone operating system called Android Automotive.  
&gt;  
&gt;â€œOur customers spend about one hour a day in their car and one hour a day away from their phone. Any car maker who tries to create an ecosystem around the car deserves to lose the customer,â€ says Martin Kristensson, head of digital business at Volvo Cars.  
&gt;  
&gt;Volvo and others say partnering with Google makes sense because consumers already use and like its products. The glitchy reputation of auto makersâ€™ existing vehicle infotainment systems adds weight to this argument. But partnering also is probably the cheaper option.  
&gt;  
&gt;â€œThere are a lot of economies of scale in software development. Auto makers who want to get more programmers and do the work themselves are generally underestimating the costs,â€ says Mark Wakefield, co-leader of the automotive and industrial practice at AlixPartners.  
&gt;  
&gt;The insistence of Daimler and VW on building up software skills might therefore be another iteration of their historic bias toward over-investment. The vast expense of electric-vehicle development has forced both companies to get more serious about cutting fixed costs in recent years; Mercedes-Benz this week committed to a 20% reduction by 2025. Ominously, though, the company also is charging into yet another technological battleground.  
&gt;

I would like to have a brand new car, pay off $5,000 of it for down payment the day I drive off the lot and just not have to worry about engine, power steering, transmission, brake problems for at least 2 to 3 years after purchase.

I am on here more of asking not only about buying a brand new car but also asking what should be done about my investments? Each of those 3 brokerage accounts I go with because each of them offers something the other one cannot offer. Furthermore in each of them I take different investment techniques and like them separate also for that reason.

I will summarize my situation the best I can. I am a 27 yo single gay man (so kids are not going to happen by accident) living with a relative for cheap (rent is $300 a month - pay for my own food/gas for car, etc). 

I currently have approx. $8k in the bank. I have a small amount of money in cryptocurrencies (planning on holding for the long term) and approx. $4k in mid/large cap stocks (also planning on holding for the long term). I have approx. $11k in student loans right now (graduated with a BA in the field I work in, graduated in 2016). 

I am trying to get my financial life as organized as I can. I listen to people like Dave Ramsey, but much of their advice is geared towards people who eventually will have kids (hence the reason for baby step 5 which is to save for your kids college fund). A lot of financial experts like Dave Ramsey say a person should pay off all of their debt before building an emergency fund and/or investing. The issue is I did not know who Dave Ramsey was until right now and am not sure if I should pay off my student loans since there is a good probability $10k of student loans will be forgiven in the future 2 years?

Currently make approx. $48k a year, working in public sector full time with benefits.

Every single paycheck for the past several months I have been putting $500 into a mutual fund through work. My ultimate goal is to have approx. $35k in it by the time I reach age 29 in a few years, and then I can completely stop investing in it and just let the compound interest take me to several hundred thousand by the time I am retirement age (between age 50 to age 62).

The main reason I do not want to pay off my debt today is because I want to always have a 4 month emergency fund, and I want to keep on pace to hit the $35k goal by age 29 as planned. Plus, if I had to guess, I would say student loans will be forgiven in some portion (most likely $10k per student loan borrower). That would leave me with just $1k in loans to pay back (which I would do ASAP). 

After I reach the $35k in the mutual fund I will then build up a bigger emergency fund (to $15k) then will either a) get my own cheap apartment or b) save up a large amount of money for my own home.

He further went on to say if you do the square foot math the studio/1 bedroom apartments are cheaper. He also said most people like the cheap price tag of an efficiency apartment but soon come to find out the extra $400-$500 a month is worth it for the literal breathing room.

I likewise do not have relatives I can talk to about all this because I came from poverty and they do not have the ability to obtain a credit card because of having horrible credit... 

I am 28, single and no kids. I live with a relative very cheap to try to save up money to pay for the down payment on a house. I have 7 credit cards, and the total available credit on all if I was to consolidate would be $48,550. After doing a little research I discovered that this is somewhat high, in fact very high for my age. My distant friend who I had talked about this with many years ago only had a line of credit through their bank but no credit cards.

My Discover is needed to buy groceries at my local grocery store because it is the only method of payment it accepts besides cash. My American Express gets me 3% cash back on all gas purchases. I pay off the balances every month. In fact I was considering getting 2 more credit cards within the next year simply because I like what they have to offer...

I am a 29 yo. I am currently single, but have found a person I would like to start a relationship with. I want to someday move away from rural America and move to a more urban area. I have lived with a relative since graduating college 6 years ago. That relative is going into a nursing home next year in the summer of 2023. I am going to want to move to a more urban area. The cost of living in urban America is of course about 40-90% higher than in rural America. I currently have $10k in savings. I also have approx. $20k in several different brokerage accounts. I also have approx. $60k in my retirement account at work (I cannot withdraw this money unless I am retirement age). I have no debts right now. 

How much should I save up between now and August 2022, which is when I plan to move to urban America? I would probably want to live alone for 1 year before having any partner move in with me. The rent for a studio where I want to live (Milwaukee) hovers around $1,400 in rent. 

I bring home a net pay of $2,800 where I work now. It is important to note that where I work has several locations and I can easily land a job in Milwaukee making approx. $2,800 doing what I do now for the same company.

I work for the government as a full time employee. The area I work in there is as much overtime as you want. There are locations all over the state I live in, both urban and rural. Also, there is a lot of upward mobility. I have been a base level employee since graduating from college in 2016. Immediately after college I had no money and moved in with my grandmother. 
Since 2016 I have lived with my grandmother. What was originally going to be just a few months of living with her turned into just over 6.5 years as of right now. I was going to move out in 2018 because I was financially prepared with a 6 month emergency fund, and plenty of money to spare. My grandmother broke down and began to cry when I told her I was viewing apartments. I ended up staying with her. I do do a lot of work around her house and since she is single, 84 yo and owns a medium sized home I decided to stay.

You deserve it. Go meet new people.â€ 
There are pros and cons of either decision. Grandma has money but I still pay her rent ($300/month) and I buy my own groceries, do my own laundry, etc. I bring home $3,100 a month take home. Car is paid off, but will need replacement in a few years. My current budget after auto insurance, food, iPhone, gas, life insurance, gym membership, etc leaves me with $1,850 a month. The area I want to move to has an average 1 bedroom rent of $1,100. Utilities/internet would cost $320 a month. It still leaves play money, it even leaves room for a used car payment.

17hui7k,waltwhitman83,"Why do you think the S&P is down 10.5% in the past 3 months?

SPY was $457.79 on July 31st. Today on October 27th, it is ~$410.

The market usually reacts to multiple things:

* geopolitical events 

* data from reports (GDP, CPI, employment, etc.)

* data from earnings from companies

* emotions

* the rate of alternative investments (like bonds/treasuries or money-market funds that react to the federal funds rate)

As far as I can tell, earnings from big companies have been good and not catastrophic.

CPI is ""ok""

Employment is showing the labor market is resilient + resistant to what the Federal Reserve is trying to achieve (stop inflation) which is interesting because it conflicts with their dual mandate of maximum employment.

In my opinion, the market is reacting to the realization that the economy is resilient enough to withstand the federal funds rate being ~4-5%, which means the Fed will continue to make data driven decisions that will result in higher for longer. As an estimate, we could argue we hypothetically won't see the Fed do any rate cuts whatsoever in the next 12 months.

What I don't get is... why all of a sudden? The market topped at $457 right around the time of the last FOMC meeting. I remember the updated dot plot projections came out from the Federal Reserve that showed ""higher for longer"" and basically kicked off this selloff. What I don't get is... why is it still happening and why at this rate? Is that really the sole catalyst or is something else happening I'm not aware of. I'm aware that the higher the 10 year (risk free rate) creeps, the worse it is for equities in the next 1 to 5 years.

If this isn't the sole reason the market is down 10%, I feel like I personally (a ""retail"" investor with information available to me basically only through whatever is on the public, free, open Internet) have no clue why the market is reacting the way it is. What is the catalyst?

I get it, everybody here is dollar-cost-averaging $500/mo into their 401k irregardless and they want a badge of honor on how they ignore the market and are sticking to their great 30 year long investment plan. Amazing. Congratulations. My question is... is that's what is driving the market up 40% in 14 months? Regular John Smith's 401k on his $120k/yr salary? I doubt it.

I thought on a good year, when earnings beat estimates and forecasts were positive and not revised downward, we could reliably expect companies to grow so much that overall the market averages 10% of growth before inflation.

How the heck are we up 39% from August 2020 to now? Are the 505 companies inside of the S&amp;P 39% more profitable/forward looking than they were then? 

The money the Fed printed for stimulus + CoVID relief... has it left the ""banking"" system? It went fed -&gt; banks. Are the banks lending it out? If not... I know that money ""exists"" on paper but... is it really in circulation? Who got it and who spent it?","Confirmation Bias, Anchoring, Status Quo Bias, Recency Bias, Affect Heuristic","The statement exhibits several biases. The author questions the sustainability of the market's growth, citing skepticism about the reasons behind it. This indicates a Confirmation Bias, as they seem to be seeking information that confirms their doubts about the market. The author also anchors their expectations of market growth to pre-COVID highs and a typical 10% growth rate, demonstrating Anchoring. Their dismissal of regular investors' 401k contributions as a driving force behind the market's growth and emphasis on a vague group of wealthy individuals with ""pent-up money"" suggests a Status Quo Bias, where they struggle to accept changes in the market dynamics.

qzpaxj,waltwhitman83,"If all cash seeking return ends up in equities because there are no alternatives worth the risk, what happens to bonds if the fed raises interest rates?

I wanted to validate that I'm not totally wrong in thinking:

right now, nobody wants bonds. not thousandires, not millionaires, not billionaires with tons of cash to park who just want to earn a few bucks (hedge against inflation) and forget about it. the yields are too low and unattractive. real estate also has its own issues, crypto, etc. equities are currently *the* answer on where to park cash for the time being. with that said:

the 20 year bond is sitting around 2%

if the federal reserve changes the base lending interest rate from 0-0.25% (which is what it is at now) to 0.25-0.50% (which is the most likely occurence we're going to see monetary policy wise) within the next 12-18 months, what does that do to the 20 year treasury bond for example? does it go up 0.25bps?","Anchoring, Status Quo Bias, Present Bias","The statement exhibits several biases. The author starts by assuming that all cash seeking return ends up in equities, indicating a present bias, as they prioritize short-term gains over long-term considerations. They also anchor on the current low-interest-rate environment, assuming that a 0.25-0.50% rate increase will only lead to a 0.25bps increase in the 20-year treasury bond, which seems overly simplistic. Furthermore, the author's dismissal of bonds as an unattractive option due to low yields suggests a status quo bias, as they are resistant to considering alternative investments outside of equities. The author's reliance on the current market trends and their expectation of a specific interest rate increase also indicates an anchoring bias.","The user exhibits a tendency to prioritize short-term market trends and current conditions, leading to biases in their investment decisions, specifically anchoring on current interest rates, resisting alternative investments, and focusing on immediate gains."
r7irbb,waltwhitman83,"When is it worth it to diversify $8m into commercial real estate instead of being 100% allocated in the market? 5.6% cap rate

Hypothetical: net worth $100m-$250m

(please spare me the point where somebody chimes in and the top voted comment is ""go see a financial advisor"". no duh. common sense. this is just hypothetical/to prove a point in a unique situation. if anything, i'm saying, hey r/investing, let's pretend to be financial advisors and see how well we would do in this context)

You already have a ton of exposure to stocks. ETFs/mutual funds, track the index, yada yada.

If you can pull in ~$620k/yr gross, $450k/yr net (25% operating expenses), write off 2.2% depreciation of the purchase price from 5 years ago (about $3.7m-$4.5m), and also benefit from the compounding appreciation of roughly 3% a year on $8m ($240k/yr the first year)... does this make sense?

Context: the buildings are paid off. No financing/mortgage/interest.

I am not sure if this is wrong but... running a cap rate calculator based on the *current* market value of the properties is 5.6%.

To me... that's bad. But is this all an example of how ""what you read online doesn't really apply all of the time/it depends on other factors"". You could do better by *not* being a landlord, not having tenants, not having to maintain buildings, sell the buildings for $8m, clear $7m after fees/closing costs, and put it in the market at 10% (before inflation).

But... is this proof that... high net worth individuals are willing to take ""less return"" in the name of diversification?

I would say the returns are relatively neck-and-neck when you take into account tax deductions (net about $30k in the 37% bracket), appreciation added to net income (another $240k on top in appreciation of $450k is a big deal. That's generating almost $700,000/yr net on $8m in capital being tied up, plus the $30k in tax deductions makes it about $730k/yr).

Is it a no brainer to do commercial real estate instead of stocks in this case? Am I reading too heavily into ""5.6% cap rate is bad"". Is cap rate for people who don't have the buildings paid off? Could I (in this hypothetical situation) command higher rent given the cap rate? Is cap rate supposed to be on purchase price, not market value?","Anchoring, Status Quo Bias, Confirmation Bias, Mental Accounting","The user's analysis exhibits several biases. Firstly, they anchor on the 5.6% cap rate, considering it ""bad"" without properly contextualizing it for a paid-off property. This indicates an Anchoring bias, as they rely heavily on this figure without adjusting for their specific situation. The user also displays Status Quo Bias by questioning the merits of deviating from a 100% stock allocation, implying a preference for maintaining the current investment status quo. Furthermore, they seem to seek validation for their perspective, asking if their reasoning is correct and if high net worth individuals are willing to accept lower returns for diversification, which suggests Confirmation Bias. Lastly, Mental Accounting is evident in their separate consideration of returns from commercial real estate and stocks, not fully integrating these investments into a unified portfolio perspective.","The user exhibits a tendency to anchor on specific metrics, favor maintaining current investment allocations, seek validation for their views, and compartmentalize different investments, indicating a complex interplay of biases influencing their financial decision-making."
rbvkwm,waltwhitman83,"Do we think future earnings will suffer due to increased wages *and* decreased productivity? Example: Better.com CEO claims 250 workers stealing company time working 2 hours a day due to remote work-from-home culture

The author appears to be influenced by Confirmation Bias, as they selectively focus on a single example (Better.com CEO's claim) that supports their pre-existing notion that remote work leads to decreased productivity and increased wages, potentially harming company earnings. Additionally, Anchoring is present as the author uses a specific example to anchor their perspective, potentially ignoring other factors that might affect company earnings. The Affect Heuristic is also evident, as the author's emotional reaction to the idea of workers ""stealing time"" seems to drive their concern about the impact on company earnings, rather than a dispassionate analysis of the situation.","The user exhibits a tendency to selectively seek confirming evidence and rely on emotionally charged examples, leading to a potentially narrow and biased perspective on the impact of remote work on company earnings."
rmirc9,waltwhitman83,"Is inflation good for equities because there are no alternatives for return-seeking cash or is inflation bad for equities because increased costs will eat into profit margins?

What's the overall verdict? I'm sure the answer lies in the middle.

Having to pay employees more (at corporations/companies who do attempt to give cost of living raises) and having your entire supply chain cost more is a problem. Can you pass 100% of the inflation-related expenses on to your consumers? I don't know.

Sometimes the market goes up, up, up and the advice passed around here is ""billions of dollars need return! bonds too low, inflation good!""

Then the market goes down and we get news articles about fears of inflation.

Inflation is here. We're like 38% higher than we were on 02/14/2020 (right before COVID crash) on the S&amp;P. $337 -&gt; $467 on SPY. Far more than the typical 7-10% we see touted around these forums. It hasn't caused the market to stop climbing yet.","Confirmation Bias, Recency Bias, Affect Heuristic","The statement exhibits several biases. The author seems to be swayed by recent market trends, noting that the S&P has increased by 38% since February 2020, and inflation hasn't caused the market to stop climbing yet. This focus on recent data points and market performance indicates Recency Bias. The author also cites conflicting advice from various sources, mentioning that some argue inflation is good for equities, while others fear its impact on profit margins. However, the author doesn't seem to actively seek out or weigh objective evidence, instead presenting a mix of opinions and selectively focusing on certain data points, which is indicative of Confirmation Bias. Furthermore, the author's emotional tone and reliance on general market sentiments (""billions of dollars need return! bonds too low, inflation good!"") suggest the use of the Affect Heuristic, where emotional reactions guide their assessment of inflation's impact on equities.","The user exhibits a tendency to favor recent market trends and selectively consider information that confirms their pre-existing notions, while also relying on emotional reactions to guide their investment decisions."

Let's make a pros and cons list.

Pro = let's get out of this 10% correction and go back to bull market where we slowly set new all time highs week after week

Con = 10% correction roughly, what are reasons we are due for another 10% drop and then some?

Disclaimer: I'm not going to ""trade"" or ""change my investment"" strategy based on any of this. It's just for fun/knowledge transfer/learning new perspectives in the community.

A few weeks ago, the market decided a 37x P/E was ok. Then some new data/news came in and consensus changed and now we're hovering at a 25x P/E. Will we head back to the mean of 16x? What will it take for the market to justify a 37x P/E again? What's stopping us from heading to a 20x P/E?

https://www.multpl.com/s-p-500-pe-ratio

List anything you can think of. 

Cons:

* Fed funding rate increasing from 0.25% to 1.25% within the next 18 months

* inflation eating into profit margins/amount of free cash consumers have

* lingering long term effects of rampant money printing that happened past 18 months

* Fed announcing MBS purchases/QE coming to an end

* national debt is high

* productivity losses due to newly remote-first workforce

* labor shortage influencing how many projects companies can get done

* supply chain/chip shortages making business difficult

* CoVID restrictions/lockdowns/waves/variants

* geopolitical tensions like Ukraine/Russia, Taiwan/China

* mid-term elections coming up in US

* US housing market is broken in many areas due to increased demand and lowered supply

Pros:

* Real GDP growth was reported strong

* Everything was fine as of January 4th (according to the market at least)

* some people have lots of cash sitting on the sidelines pent up from not being able to go anywhere during pandemic/just having all of their assets appreciate with inflation, etc.

* CoVID coming to an end

* strong job market

* companies might report strong earnings from increased sales during Q4 2020 of pandemic","Anchoring, Confirmation Bias, Status Quo Bias, Recency Bias, Affect Heuristic","The statement exhibits several biases.

slztfh,waltwhitman83,"Whatâ€™s the current bull case?

As interest rates rise in the future, earnings of the companies that make up the index will most likely fall (since access to cheap capital going forward will slowly erode)

If companies earn less and grow less, they are typically worth less.

With all of this â€œknownâ€ and â€œpriced inâ€ data, whatâ€™s the case for the S&amp;P to reach back to its all time high of 4800, and then continue growing onwards to 5000 and beyond?

teuhlf,waltwhitman83,"What are the chances S&amp;P500 index sees 3800 this year?

Sorry if this post is stupid. I know macroeconomic predictions are stupid but I also feel that this sort of falls closer to ""long term investing"" than it does ""daytrading/swing trading/momentum trading/technical analysis/guessing when + where the market is going at a micro level"".

We opened the year 4796 and we're at 4242, a 554 point/11.5% drop

To get to 3800 would be another 442 points downwards, which is 10% from where we are now (would be 20.7% overall)

We all knew that with the fed raising interest rates, stock valuations were due to come down. More expensive debt (if the company is using leverage/debt to grow, which most are?) = more revenue/income/cash flow spent on servicing debt = less profits posted each quarter = lower EPS. According to https://www.cmegroup.com/trading/interest-rates/countdown-to-fomc.html, we will most likely see interest rates be within the range of 1.5% - 2.25% by December 2022. 

Oil seems to have come back down almost to pre-Russia/Ukraine war numbers. Light crude oil futures (CL1!) were at $92/barrel on February 24th. Currently sitting around $98 (down from their highs of $123). About a 6.5% increase. Granted, $92 wasn't a great price either, with oil mainly trading between $65-$85 for the year prior. If oil stays high... that's obviously an issue since it is responsible for so much of how the global economy works. 

Rising interest rates, high oil prices eating into consumer spending power, inflation as a whole eating into consumer spending power, geopolitical conflict in Ukraine/Russia, fed slowly tapering the amount of bond/MBS purchasing they have been doing to remove the extra liquidity + ""artificial propping up of value"" from those markets, residential real estate home supply crunch keeping most regular people away from being able to purchase a home, therefore increasing demand for rent, increasing rental prices as well.

tjpdnx,waltwhitman83,"Why is the Federal Reserve raising interest rates going to lower inflation?

fed raising interest rates: forces businesses/corporations who are looking to continue financing growth through debt/loans spend more due to higher interest rates, aka less free cash flow (since it will cost more to service any new loans going forward) aka less money to hire people with, give bonuses/raises, reinvest into the company, etc.

tsirle,waltwhitman83,"What's a semi-accurate best guess on what parties are responsible (and at what % of volume) for the roughly 1-2b shares of SPY traded monthly on average?

Obviously we will never know EXACTLY who/what traded every share.

But I'm curious if we have any data available to us that can help us understand the markets better.

BlackRock has IVV, Vanguard has VOO. From what I can tell, SPY is managed by State Street Global Advisors.

I know the options chain is obviously part of a certain % of volume (probably a small one) because puts/calls getting exercised will always trigger shares trading hands... right? I can only imagine the complexity of the SPY options chain and won't pretend to understand even a fraction of it. The only question I have is... is it responsible for 90m shares trading a day alone? Probably a not.

I don't think a lot of 401ks or pensions or any other retirement accounts where average Americans dollar-cost-average a portion of their paycheck income/savings end up in SPY. That takes out ""institutional investing"" into SPY, right? If not... what institutions are buying SPY? What product are they offering on top of it, and to who? How large are they? Why wouldn't their customers just buy SPY themselves?

I don't think retail traders/retail day traders/retail swing traders/anything retail are a huge % of the market when speaking about a daily volume perspective. I don't know how big the retail trading market is (on a daily or weekly or monthly scale) but I'd love to learn more. I'm going to guess it's 5-20% of daily volume, being extremely generous. I agree that it's asinine to even think retail is responsible for 20% of daily volume but... I literally can't even estimate/guess/come up with a hypothesis on where the other 95% of the daily volume from SPY comes from. 

Do other asset management companies (who aren't big enough to have their own S&amp;P ETF offerings) charge their clients a fee to put their money in SPY for them behind the scenes, and they are daily rebalancing? Is that where some of the volume comes from?

I know a lot of algorithms are fighting each other for fractions of a penny all day at rapid speed, shaving nanoseconds off and frontrunning buy/sell orders from Robinhood (and others) to make money at scale. But... they can't just trade in between each other all day, can they? Like... there are only so many Robinhood buyers, and all of their volume isn't going to SPY... If ""market makers"" are behind the majority of volume because they are providing liquidity, who are the buyers and sellers on each side? We already determined the majority is not retail, not institutions since they would be targeting mutual funds instead of the ETF.

The market is open from 9:30am -&gt; 4:00pm (6.5 hours, 23.4k seconds). If you ignore pre-market and after-hours (not sure what % of daily volume these two trading windows are responsible for, I'm going to guess less than 10%), you're talking about roughly 2b shares traded in a 21 day window, roughly 95.2m shares per day, just over 4,070 shares a second. What parties are buying and selling 4k shares a second every second of every trading day on average for the entire year on average?

&gt; According to a 2017 JPMorgan analysis, passive investors like ETFs and quantitative investment accounts, which utilize high-frequency algorithmic trading, were responsible for about 60 percent of overall trading volumes while ""fundamental discretionary traders"" (or traders who evaluate the fundamental factors affecting a stock before making an investment) comprised only 10 percent of the overall figures.

tth665,waltwhitman83,"Let's peel apart the February 2022 7.9% CPI measurement to figure out if the data shows ""it's because the fed printed money""

Stuff in 2021 cost 7.9% less than it did in 2022. Let's investigate:

&gt; The CPI-U is a more general index and seeks to track retail prices as they affect all urban consumers. It encompasses about 87 percent of the United States' population. The CPI-W is a more specialized index and seeks to track retail prices as they affect urban hourly wage earners and clerical workers.

&gt; The three largest components of the CPI are housing, transportation, and food/beverages in that order.

&gt; They are weighted this way: housing 41.4%; food and beverages 17.4%; transport 17.0%; medical care 6.9%; apparel 6.0%; recreation 4.4%; other 6.9%. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consumer_price_index

How much is each category up?

    Housing (CPIHOSNS): 275.13 -&gt; 291.50 (5.95%)
    Food and beverages (CPIUFDSL): 271.42 -&gt; 292.91 (7.9%)
    Transport (CPITRNSL): 211.47 -&gt; 256.02 (21.06%)
    Medical care (CPIMEDSL): 523.03 -&gt; 535.73 (2.43%)
    Apparel (CPIAPPSL): 118.53 -&gt; 126.34 (6.59%)
    Recreation (CPIRECSL): 122.89 -&gt; 128.97 (4.97%)
    Other (CPIOGSSL): 469.88 -&gt; 496.04 (5.57%)

2021: (41.4Ã—275.13+17.4Ã—271.42+17Ã—211.47+6.9Ã—523.03+6Ã—118.53+4.4Ã—122.89+6.9Ã—469.88) / (41.4+17.4+17+6.9+6+4.4+6.9) = 278.11055

2022: (41.4Ã—291.50+17.4Ã—292.91+17Ã—256.02+6.9Ã—535.73+6Ã—126.34+4.4Ã—128.97+6.9Ã—496.04) / (41.4+17.4+17+6.9+6+4.4+6.9) = 299.61795

My weights are a little outdated/off but the math checks out: about 7.7% increase 2021 -&gt; 2022

Now let's dive into some of the categories. A lot of people say CPI is a shitty metric that doesn't capture the ""true"" inflation Americans are experiencing. I've read countless times on Reddit how the entire formula is set up in a way to hide ""real inflation"" from the American people.

Here are the same categories, sorted by how much they are up year over year:

    (21.06%) Transport (CPITRNSL): 211.47 -&gt; 256.02 
    (7.9%) Food and beverages (CPIUFDSL): 271.42 -&gt; 292.91  
    (6.59%) Apparel (CPIAPPSL): 118.53 -&gt; 126.34  
    (5.95%) Housing (CPIHOSNS): 275.13 -&gt; 291.50  
    (5.57%) Other (CPIOGSSL): 469.88 -&gt; 496.04 
    (4.97%) Recreation (CPIRECSL): 122.89 -&gt; 128.97

Obviously, housing matters more to people than apparel. Keep in mind the transport category is what holds gasoline prices, and this was a reading before the Ukraine-Russia conflict if I remember correctly.

ultmzk,waltwhitman83,"At what level will we see capitulation?

Buying the CoVID flash crash of 2020 turned out to (at least shortly after) be a really good dip buying opportunity.

everybody seems to know how much the Fed will do quantitive tightening per month, but nobody seems to be aware of any of their targets long-term. For example, we donâ€™t know if theyâ€™ll be able to keep the course of unwinding $100 billion a month for six months, eight months, 12 months, 60 months.

their balance sheet was a little bit below $4 trillion before the pandemic, and itâ€™s now currently closer to 9 trillion. Thereâ€™s no data to prove this but Iâ€™m going to guess the Fed obviously has a desire to lower their balance sheet, and pre-pandemic levels could potentially be a good target. Meaning they have to unroll about $5 trillion, which at current rates would take about 50 months.

there is nothing that states all stock market price discovery should break over this. Thereâ€™s nothing to say that companies will not make and grow earnings.

However, weâ€™re obviously going through what seems like a correction. The joke around this sub has always been, if too many people are buying weâ€™re at the top, and when people start making posts like this, we should be closer to the bottom.

all jokes aside since Iâ€™m not really interested in calling bottoms or timing or anything like that, Iâ€™m just curious where a â€œsaneâ€ level of â€œdowntrendâ€ makes sense.

do we revert to the mean of 15x P/E? iâ€™m not exactly sure what price that puts us at. I will do the math later. that would be with trailing 12 month earnings, and if 20% of the companies in the S&amp;P (random number) fail to grow or even start to go backwards earnings wise, the valuation projection quickly becomes useless.

this form really hates to say numbers. They love by the dip. I love by the dip. I see how time in the market works. Iâ€™m not trying to time any markets.

just trying to have a conversation on what some eye opening numbers would be if you were to see them flash across your screen from a bottom prescriptive.

The author anchors on the pre-pandemic levels of the Fed's balance sheet ($4 trillion) and uses it as a target for potential unwinding, which may not be a relevant or realistic goal. They also display confirmation bias by citing the success of buying during the CoVID flash crash of 2020 as evidence that ""buying the dip"" is a good strategy, while ignoring potential differences between the two situations. The author's use of phrases like ""everybody seems to know"" and ""nobody seems to be aware"" suggests that they are influenced by the affect heuristic, relying on their emotions and intuition rather than objective analysis. Additionally, the recent experience of a market correction and the CoVID flash crash may have led to recency bias, where the author overemphasizes recent events and assumes they will recur.","The author exhibits a tendency to rely on intuition and recent experiences, leading to biased decision-making influenced by anchoring, confirmation, affect, and recency biases."

https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/GFDEGDQ188S

Currently 125%

Started being above 100% since 2012

Used to be sub 65% for most time before 2008

I'm well aware that ""it'll be a problem when the country can't afford to repay the interest"". I don't know how much we pay yearly in terms of... how much goes to interest, how much goes to principal. How far are we from not being able to repay just the interest? Japan has 200%. Could we sustain 200% without isuses?

&gt; Japanâ€™s ratio at the end of 2019 was higher: about 200%, according to data from the Bank of Japan and Japanâ€™s Ministry of Foreign Affairs and calculations by St. Louis Fed Economist Miguel Faria-e-Castro.

https://www.stlouisfed.org/open-vault/2020/october/debt-gdp-ratio-how-high-too-high-it-depends

I know most of debt is owned by the ""public"".

&gt; The public holds over $22 trillion of the national debt.3 Foreign governments hold a large portion of the public debt, while the rest is owned by U.S. banks and investors, the Federal Reserve, state and local governments, mutual funds, pensions funds, insurance companies, and holders of savings bonds.

https://www.thebalance.com/who-owns-the-u-s-national-debt-3306124#:~:text=The%20public%20holds%20over%20%2422,and%20holders%20of%20savings%20bonds.

I don't understand the full mechanism on how... the federal government runs at least a $1t-$2t deficit yearly based on current trends of budgeting. They take on debt by issuing bonds. I don't know what ""open market"" they put these bonds up for sale on. 

&gt; https://www.statista.com/statistics/246420/major-foreign-holders-of-us-treasury-debt/#:~:text=Foreign%20holders%20of%20United%20States%20treasury%20debt&amp;text=Of%20the%20total%207.55%20trillion,1.3%20trillion%20U.S.%20dollars%20worth.

I know Japan/China buy up some bonds (foreign countries hold $7.5t of $30t). Not really sure domestically where the money goes/comes from. When the government is $1t short on spending vs tax income, they issue a bond. To who? Then, they domestically turn around and buy the same bond? Can you call that printed money a la federal reserve? I have to be misunderstanding something so please feel free to fill me in. I tried Googling to figure out this answer but have been coming up short.

That rabbit hole aside, can we slowly creep up to 200% debt-to-GDP like Japan without issue? Will we ever get down below 100% again?","Anchoring, Status Quo Bias, Confirmation Bias","The user's analysis of the US debt-to-GDP ratio exhibits several biases. Firstly, the user anchors on Japan's debt-to-GDP ratio of 200% and implies that the US can sustain a similar ratio without issues, suggesting that the user's perception of an acceptable debt-to-GDP level is influenced by Japan's experience. This is an example of Anchoring, where the user relies too heavily on a specific piece of information (Japan's 200% ratio). Additionally, the user's questioning of whether the US can ""slowly creep up to 200% debt-to-GDP like Japan without issue"" suggests a Status Quo Bias, as they seem to be accepting the current trend and implying that no significant action is needed. Furthermore, the user selectively presents information that supports their inquiry, such as referencing Japan's and China's holdings of US debt, while not fully understanding the domestic distribution of debt, indicating a Confirmation Bias, where they seek information that confirms their preconceptions.","The user exhibits a tendency to rely on specific information points, such as Japan's debt-to-GDP ratio, and displays a complacent attitude towards rising debt levels, indicating biases towards anchoring, status quo, and confirmation."

I feel this data fights the narrative of ""nobody can afford rent, $5/gallon gas is killing the consumer and bleeding into the cost of everything else they buy (food)""

Which is it? Does the consumer have an all-time-high balance sheet and can weather a storm without issue because they are flush with cash on hand (handed out/saving during the pandemic) or is the lower half of America struggling, suffering, barely hanging on, about to get laid off while the country stagnates?","Confirmation Bias, Anchoring, Affect Heuristic","The statement exhibits Confirmation Bias as the author selectively interprets the St. Louis Fed data to support their pre-existing narrative that contradicts the common narrative of economic struggle. The author anchors on the data showing strong household balance sheets and uses it to dispute the opposing view, without adequately considering alternative perspectives or potential limitations of the data.

vdvlvc,waltwhitman83,"Why are oil prices high if the Russia/Ukraine war just shuffled around the supply/demand dynamic globally?

Before the invasion, US + EU + UK + Australia + ""whoever else decided to move off of Russian oil for moral reasons"" used to get oil (partially) from Russia.

I don't know what China/India did before the Russian/Ukranian invasion. A blend of various nations I'm sure, just like any other country. The narrative being passed around is currently ""they purchased less oil from Russia than compared to now"". 

If all we did (the US + ""morally upstanding countries"") was (partially) move our supplier from Russia to Saudis (or whoever could fill the gap in demand), and all China + India did was move their supplier from Saudis to Russia (giving Saudis more supply to sell it us), where is the actual shift in the overall supply/demand that is driving gas to be elevated?

Let's assume demand is/has been relatively constant (if anything it's declining because people are driving less now that it's high but that's irrelevant in my opinion).

Let's assume zero countries can magically flip a switch and come up with more supply (they don't want to for profitability reasons/they literally can't do it on a dime).

I'm well aware that nobody would want to invest short term (1-5 years) in oil because the current macroeconomic picture is a world that at least attempts to move away from fossil fuels in the name of climate change concerns/a hope for an Earth with less global ""pollution"" / ""greenhouse gases"".

The author also displays Anchoring by fixating on the pre-invasion supply/demand dynamics and assuming that demand has remained relatively constant, which may not be the case. Furthermore, the author's skepticism about the possibility of increased investment in oil due to climate change concerns reveals a Status Quo Bias, where they seem to accept the current trend of decreasing fossil fuel investment as a given and imply that it will continue.","The user tends to selectively interpret information to confirm their own views, relies on initial assumptions, and accepts current trends as a given, indicating a bias towards confirmation, anchoring, and maintaining the status quo."

It's no secret that it's extremely easy to lose money when it comes to investing. By thinking you're smarter than the average bear and doing things like:

* try to pick individual stocks that don't beat S&amp;P when it comes to drawdown/return other than say... some of the best tech stocks of the past 10-20 years

* introducing leverage/margin into a buy and hold strategy

* trying to time the market/do things like investing in an ETF that shorts the market when you 'think' it's going down

* trying to trade options/buy calls/puts and hope that you get the timing right and sell the increase in premium/IV but instead get caught in the wrong trade and have them expire worthless/near worthless on you

* trying to trade things like commodities/forex

* trying to trade things like futures (which move $50 for 1 SPX point directionally on /ES)

* trying to draw trend lines/support/resistance/thinking you can accurately predict price movement based on patterns/history/wedges/candlestick patterns

* use one of thousands of indicators like RSI/MACD/Bollinger Bands to try and suggest good entry/exit prices

* try to make money by investing in currencies/crypto/random countries

There's obviously at least some market for ""Quantitative Algorithmic Trading Jobs""

I'm just curious, how much of this is publicly accessible? There's SPY and IVV and VOO and VTI. People eat those up and love them.

Why wouldn't people love access to an ETF that supposedly beats buy and hold through technical analysis/quantitive analysis/anything? A company offering that could potentially rake in lots of money. If the answer is ""very few of them beat buy and hold"", why is the industry as big as it is? If you google ""does technical analysis actually work"", https://www.google.com/search?q=does+technical+analysis+really+work you get a ton of articles saying... yes it does. This is contrary to what I would have thought.

I've done a bit of light skimming on research papers related to computer programming algorithmic reinforcement training, and... it's almost 50-50. 50% of them say ""no correlation was found, what we developed underperformed, stock market price movement is basically random noise"" and the other 50% said ""yep, totally possible, we beat buy and hold"".

What's the truth? I'm not looking to hear ""1 in 10 people can successfully do TA/be a day trader/beat buy and hold"". I want to hear... why isn't it agreed upon that *0* out of 10 average people can beat buy and hold? and if quant funds can beat buy and hold... where are they? are they really ""so secret"" that only people with millions can access them? My friend has $100m-$200m, he put some into something claiming to be a quant fund, it's down 30% this year...","Confirmation Bias, Overconfidence, Status Quo Bias, Sunk Cost Fallacy","The statement exhibits several biases. The author seems to be inclined towards a skeptical view of technical analysis and quantitative analysis beating buy and hold, but then presents a biased search result summary that focuses on the 50-50 split in research papers. This selective presentation indicates Confirmation Bias, as the author cherry-picks information supporting their pre-existing skepticism. The author's dismissal of the effectiveness of technical analysis and quantitative analysis also reveals Overconfidence, as they seem certain that ""0 out of 10 average people can beat buy and hold."" Furthermore, the author's friend's experience with a quant fund that is down 30% this year might be influencing their skepticism, illustrating a Sunk Cost Fallacy. Lastly, the author's general questioning of the quant industry and their seeming preference for the status quo (buy and hold) indicates Status Quo Bias.","The user exhibits a tendency to selectively seek and present information that confirms their pre-existing skepticism towards technical analysis and quantitative analysis, while displaying overconfidence in their views and a bias towards maintaining the current investment approach."
vmgdo8,waltwhitman83,"How is S&amp;P 500 EPS TTM calculated for the index?

Not at the individual ticker level, I'm talking about:

https://ycharts.com/indicators/sp_500_eps_ttm $197.87, which they got from https://www.spglobal.com/spdji/en/documents/additional-material/sp-500-eps-est.xlsx which lists the past 4 quarters (TTM = trailing 12 months) as the following EPS for the entire index:

* 12/31/21 - $53.94
* 9/30/21 - $49.59
* 6/30/21 - $48.39
* 3/31/21 - $45.95

What weighting/formula are they doing? They don't seem to be doing EpsTtm*SharesOutstanding.

I have all the tickers of the S&amp;P in a spreadsheet with their shares outstanding (or shares float, it's only a touch off) + EPS TTM. You can use this to calculate P/E for a stock, and P/E for S&amp;P by sector, etc. 

I have all duplicate tickers removed (NWSA, FOXA, GOOGL)

I have ~322.447b for shares outstanding and $1.776t for earnings. That data makes no sense because it doesn't divide cleanly into $197.87

https://ycharts.com/indicators/sp_500_divisor

There's also some kind of divisor (8451.33 currently) but I don't think it's relevant. That's more for the free-float market-cap weight thingie (which I don't think applies to EPS?)

Some more fun facts: 18 companies in the S&amp;P have negative trailing-twelve month earnings:

* STZ - beer/wine/spirits distribution
* BIO - chemical production for biochemical / pharmaceutical
* CDAY - human capital management software
* AES - power generation and utility services through renewable and thermal generation facilities?
* LYV - live concerts
* WYNN - casino resorts
* CAH - healthcare services
* LVS - casinos
* CZR - casinos
* PEG - electric and gas services
* UAL - airline
* GE - high-tech industrial company
* AAL - airline
* EBAY - online marketplace
* NCLH - cruiseline
* BA - aerospace
* RCL - cruiseline
* CCL - cruiseline

I couldn't find any data on:

* CEG
* FDS
* FDX
* TJX

Once I have EPS data that calculates through, I'm going to analyze what % of EPS is driven by the top 10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 100 stocks by market cap. My guess is... quite a lot.","Overconfidence, Anchoring, Sunk Cost Fallacy","The user exhibits Overconfidence in their ability to calculate S&P500 EPS TTM, as they claim to have a comprehensive spreadsheet with accurate data on shares outstanding and EPS TTM for all S&P500 tickers. They also display a sense of certainty in their calculations, which may lead them to overlook potential errors or complexities. The user's attempt to reverse-engineer the calculation used by Yahoo Charts (ycharts.com) and their dismissal of the divisor as ""not relevant"" indicate Anchoring, as they are fixated on their own approach and resistant to alternative explanations. Furthermore, the user's significant investment of time and effort into collecting and analyzing data, despite encountering difficulties and inconsistencies, suggests a Sunk Cost Fallacy, where they feel compelled to continue their analysis due to the resources already committed.","The user exhibits a tendency to overestimate their analytical abilities and cling to their own approach, while underestimating the complexity of the S&P500 EPS TTM calculation."

2021 earnings: 208.49

2022 earnings estimate: 225

2023 earnings estimate: 240

Why are S&amp;P earnings estimated to grow 8% from 2021 -&gt; 2022, and 6.66% 2022 -&gt; 2023? If markets are forward looking... why does it feel like there's still a bit of wiggle room for future earnings estimates to be adjusted downwards? Why are markets being optimistic instead of pessimistic?

I pulled up the top 100 companies of the S&amp;P by earnings TTM (not EPS, EPS * # shares outstanding). Top 100 companies make up 65% of the market cap and 73% of the earnings for the S&amp;P500

Go through the list yourself and just ask yourself ""what's the growth case for this company if the country is in a very mild recession and consumers have less free cash to spend on goods/services due to increased living expenses like gas + energy + housing + food due to inflation and the federal reserve is making debt for financing growth slightly more expensive have previously""

Then ask yourself... why is 8% growth for this financial year priced in then? If you disagree that those 100 companies (or the bottom 400) could grow 8%... doesn't that mean we have more room to fall from S&amp;P500 3800 -&gt; some other number?","Confirmation Bias, Anchoring, Recency Bias, Affect Heuristic","The user's statement reflects a critical analysis of S&P 500 earnings growth estimates, but also reveals several biases. The user seems to be questioning the optimistic earnings growth estimates, citing potential recessionary pressures and inflationary effects on consumer spending. However, in doing so, they selectively focus on negative factors, which is indicative of Confirmation Bias. They anchor on the estimated growth rates of 8% and 6.66% for 2022 and 2023, respectively, and use these numbers as a reference point to express skepticism, demonstrating Anchoring. The user's recent attention to market data and economic indicators leads them to emphasize potential downside risks, reflecting Recency Bias. Furthermore, their emotional tone, as conveyed through phrases like ""why does it feel like there's still a bit of wiggle room for future earnings estimates to be adjusted downwards,"" suggests an Affect Heuristic, where their judgments are influenced by their emotional response to market conditions.","The user exhibits a tendency to selectively focus on negative factors, anchor on specific estimates, and rely on recent data, while allowing emotions to influence their judgments about S&P 500 earnings growth."
wgkoe6,waltwhitman83,"How are /ES futures not ""too good to be true"" / a scam if they only take $6k-$12k in margin to get 50x SPX exposure (which would take $250k worth of SPY to achieve)

&gt; For example, if an E-mini S&amp;P 500 Index futures contract (/ES) has an initial margin requirement of $6,600 and a maintenance margin of $6,000, buyers or sellers must have $6,600 in their account to enter the contract and need to keep at least $6,000 in their account to stay in the position.

https://www.tdameritrade.com/retail-en_us/resources/pdf/TDA101284.pdf

&gt; So for the cost of $2 in commissions, you can risk $4-$6k of your account to get control of $100k worth of S&amp;P.  So if the S&amp;P goes up 1% and becomes $101k â€” you just made $1k on your ~$5k margin investment â€” thatâ€™s a 20% return on capital!

http://lifestyletrading101.com/how-to-trade-e-mini-futures-sp500/

I feel like this can be super dangerous for the average retail investor who wants big returns but has little cash (sub $20k). Is that why this product exists? Is it almost predatory to get people to risk $10k of their net worth and get themselves into way too deep/hot risky water?

I'm not here to debate how risky margin/leverage (let alone 1 SPX point being $50 per contract).

I just feel like... it's too good to be true? Not only that... you can't do wash sale trade tax writeoffs with equities but you can with futures, and they are taxed more advantageously than equities

&gt; In the United States, futures contracts are subject to the 60/40 rule. This advantageous tax treatment also applies to day trades and is broken down into two parts: 60% profits â€“ taxed as long-term capital gains. 40% profits â€“ taxed as short-term capital gains.

&gt; For options and futures contracts, the wash sale rule applies to losses from the trades or sales of options and contracts to sell or acquire stocks or securities. It does not apply to losses that you incur from trades or sales of commodity futures contracts or of foreign currencies.","Loss Aversion, Regret Aversion, Affect Heuristic, Sunk Cost Fallacy, Present Bias","The statement expresses skepticism about the /ES futures product, questioning whether it's ""too good to be true"" or even predatory, particularly for retail investors with limited capital. This concern stems from the product's high leverage (50x SPX exposure with only $6k-$12k margin) and potential for significant losses. The author's worry about investors risking a substantial portion of their net worth ($10k) to gain exposure to a large asset base ($100k) indicates Loss Aversion, as they are focused on avoiding potential losses. Regret Aversion is also present, as the author seems to be preemptively justifying their cautious stance to avoid potential regret. The use of emotive language, such as ""too good to be true"" and ""predatory,"" suggests the Affect Heuristic, where emotions are influencing the author's judgment. Furthermore, the author's reluctance to ""debate how risky margin/leverage"" implies a Present Bias, where they are prioritizing short-term caution over potential long-term benefits. Lastly, the author's fixation on the potential downsides of the product and the tax advantages may indicate a Sunk Cost Fallacy, where they are hesitant to 'lose' money or accept the potential risks.","The user exhibits a cautious and risk-averse biasing behavior, driven by concerns about potential losses and a desire to avoid regret, which leads them to question the legitimacy and safety of the /ES futures product."

&gt; S&amp;P Global Inc. is an American publicly traded corporation headquartered in Manhattan, New York City. Its primary areas of business are financial information and analytics.

Can the market keep its current 20x valuation as earnings fall and bonds/treasuries become more attractive?

As earnings are released, you are looking at the market staying below 4000 until about Q1 2023 if current P/E ratio of 20x holds.

If investors flee equities because they want to lock in bonds/treasuries as they become more attractive (due to rising interest rates) or because they find equities with shrinking earnings less attractive, P/E ratios could fall below 20x (which is historically relatively high/inflated) causing for even more pain on the price side of the ratio.

With that said, if Q3 2022 EPS estimates are literally perfect and P/E ratio stays 20x, we'll end up at $3824.60

By Q3 2023, if EPS estimates are again perfect and P/E ratio stays unchanged, we'll end up at $4155.60

That'd be 8.65% return in 12 months, which is about inline with what equities do historically.

tl;dr 3763-3824 could be on the horizon, followed by the typical 8-10% return equities usually see as earnings grow and get returned to shareholders through price appreciation","Anchoring, Status Quo Bias, Confirmation Bias","The statement exhibits several biases. Firstly, the author's analysis is anchored to a specific P/E ratio of 20x, which they consider ""historically relatively high/inflated."" This anchoring bias leads them to assume that if the P/E ratio stays at 20x, the market will behave in a certain way. Additionally, the author displays a status quo bias by assuming that the current P/E ratio will remain unchanged, despite mentioning that it could fall below 20x if investors flee equities. Furthermore, the author's interpretation of data seems to be influenced by a confirmation bias, as they selectively focus on the scenario where EPS estimates are ""literally perfect"" and the P/E ratio stays at 20x, which supports their conclusion of an 8-10% return, while downplaying other possible outcomes.","The author exhibits a tendency to rely on anchoring, status quo, and confirmation biases when analyzing market trends and making predictions, which may lead to an overly optimistic and narrow view of potential market outcomes."
x503ax,waltwhitman83,"What do you think is a fair P/E ratio valuation for the SPX given rising interest rates?

If you can get a risk-free return of 3.5%-4% from treasuries/bonds, I don't think equities really demand a 20x P/E (which is what it is now)

What does that infer? P/E ratio stands to fall as equities become less attractive. This is made doubly worse by companies having high financing costs for growth, which will decrease earnings as well.

P/E falling from 20x (current levels) -&gt; 17.5x would mean S&amp;P price could fall another 12.5% from current levels.

Are stocks 12.5% less attractive/lucrative/valuable because bonds/yields are more attractive now?","Anchoring, Present Bias, Framing Effect","The statement reflects several biases. The author anchors their valuation of a fair P/E ratio by referencing the risk-free return from treasuries/bonds (3.5%-4%), implying that equities must offer a higher return to be attractive. This anchors their expectation of a fair P/E ratio.

xdejj1,waltwhitman83,"We are 100% on track to 4%+ on federal funds rate in the near future (potentially 6%) Why are/aren't we in store for a ""Powell Shock"" (Volcker Shock 2.0)?

Inflation came in hot today. Fed has to do what they can to destroy demand to cool down the economy. Labor markets are still tight. Lower half of the economy is facing raising rent/food/energy prices that they can't easily absorb due to their low savings/low incomes.

Why is ""this time is different"" in 2022 for the Fed? Let's discuss. Why won't Powell be forced to raise interest rates to *at least* core PCE or above?

My personal take/guess:

If core PCE/CPI stay in the 6-8% range, once the fed gets rates up to 4% (which should be completed by November/December of this year), if inflation is still ""hot"", they'll probably be forced to hike rates even further at least match inflation. 400bps becomes 450bps which becomes 500bps, etc. That would take until about pretty much any time Q1-Q4 2023 (the FedWatch tool does not show anything 450bps realistically priced in whatsoever for the foreseeable futures) at the current pace.

I'm not sure what the ratio of ""federal funds rate -&gt; core PCE"" was during 1980 when Volcker put rates up to 18%. A quick Google says it was about 9%. That means it was 2x CPI/PCE (I know they aren't interchangeable, trying to keep this brief) -&gt; FFR.

Are we in store for 12% interest rates? Most likely not, right? Why is this time different?","Confirmation Bias, Anchoring, Overconfidence, Recency Bias","The statement exhibits several biases. The author seems to be under the influence of Confirmation Bias, as they selectively focus on data that supports their inflation concerns, such as the hot inflation numbers and tight labor markets, while disregarding potential counterarguments.

Overconfidence is evident in the author's definitive predictions, such as ""we are 100% on track to 4%+ on federal funds rate"" and ""if inflation is still 'hot', they'll probably be forced to hike rates even further.""

xeftus,waltwhitman83,"Let's settle this once and for all: Federal reserve interest rates + the US national debt

Part 2 of https://old.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/xdejj1/we_are_100_on_track_to_4_on_federal_funds_rate_in/

I see a lot of posts that say ""the Fed can't hike rates above 5% because then the US won't be able to afford to pay the interest on the $30t it holds in national debt"" as if the millisecond the interest rate changes, it backdates to all of the debt we've collected over the past years. I don't think that's how it works. I believe the overall national debt was financed at various rates over many years, and the current 2022-2023 ""high"" 4-6% interest rates would apply to any new debt issued during that timeframe (which we are running at a rate of about $1t a year as of https://fiscaldata.treasury.gov/national-deficit/ unless I'm reading it wrong) 

I'd like somebody with knowledge on the topic to share the truth and inform the many members of this subreddit who are confused, misinformed, wrong, etc. I know it's a complicated situation. Debt refinances itself, rolls over, etc. There is not a black/white right/wrong answer per se, but it does feel like lots of people are overly confident on their own misunderstanding of the concept.

I'd like to hear what people think is the upper limit the federal reserve can raise interest rates to (in an effort to combat inflation) before other things start to break (like people trying to get mortgages, the country being unable to repay the interest payment on its national debt, etc.)","Overconfidence, Confirmation Bias, Affect Heuristic","The statement exhibits several biases.

xjq6ay,waltwhitman83,"What if it really is as simple as ""don't fight the Fed""? Why DCA into equities during known unfavorable conditions?

It's undeniable that the bull run of basically 2009 -&gt; 2021 was fueled at least partially (if not majorly) by various forms of quantitative easing. Interest rates were historically extremely low. If you couple them with inflation at the time (2-3%), it was basically free to borrow money (with interest rates being 0-0.25%).

The market has very few reasons to be bullish in the current short term (6-18 months). The market is forward looking. We're starring down the barrel of at least 12 months of ""no more quantitative easing"" (aka higher interest rates). Couple that with quanatitive tighting, consumers feeling the effects of inflation and being unable to scrounge together discretionary funds for travel, renovations, general consumerism, etc.

Russia/Ukraine is, from what it seems, not getting any better.

American wages are having to grow due to a tight labor market. ""Quiet quitting"" is becoming a major thing. How are companies supposed to innovate/grow in these conditions?

There really isn't one country/region that is doing well. Europe has its issues. China has its issues. America has it issues.

Advice around here says: have about 3-6 months worth of cash and put the rest into equities. You're talking about most people having 95% of their non-real-estate net worth in equities based on how close they are relative to their retirement.

S&amp;P could stand to fall a lot more from 3800, couldn't it? We're still in a 19-20x P/E ratio area which is above 15x-17x which is the historical average. Historically, we're still technically ""expensive"". Historically, interest rates are still low, meaning they have more room to rise. If earnings suck during the next 2 quarters (which, they might/probably will for a slew of reasons), price could totally fall and we'd *still* be expensive P/E wise.

CPI/PCE have yet to top/slow down based on recent reports. We don't know how the ""European energy crisis"" will play out for the winter.

How likely is it that we will be back to 4500 within 18 months (18% from current levels)? Can the 2m+ investors here who have the majority of their net worth in equities really stomach another 15-30%+ downturn in the next 12-18 months?

xlm732,waltwhitman83,"Does 50-day/200-day simple moving average (golden cross/death cross) outperform naive dollar-cost-average / buy-and-hold? 1993 -&gt; 2022

https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/deathcross.asp

&gt; The ""death cross"" is a market chart pattern reflecting recent price weakness. It refers to the drop of a short-term moving averageâ€”meaning the average of recent closing prices for a stock, stock index, commodity or cryptocurrency over a set period of timeâ€”below a longer-term moving average. The most closely watched stock-market moving averages are the 50-day and the 200-day.

https://www.investopedia.com/terms/g/goldencross.asp

&gt; A golden cross is a chart pattern in which a relatively short-term moving average crosses above a long-term moving average. The golden cross is a bullish breakout pattern formed from a crossover involving a security's short-term moving average (such as the 15-day moving average) breaking above its long-term moving average (such as the 50-day moving average) or resistance level. As long-term indicators carry more weight, the golden cross indicates a bull market on the horizon and is reinforced by high trading volumes.

We are currently in a ""death cross"" state.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moving_average_crossover

&gt; Golden cross occurs when 50 days simple moving average crosses 200 days simple moving average from below.[1] Death cross is an opposite situation, when 50 days simple moving average crosses 200 days simple moving average from above.[2] Death cross is not a reliable indicator of future market declines.[3]

It's only fired 27 times in the past 28 years.

Should you invest when the market is in this ""death cross"" state (50 day moving average less than 200 day moving average)? Looks like a great way to avoid a ton of drawdown. I just don't know if it also gives up potential return.

Are we all just waiting for the 50 day moving average (currently at $403.24 on SPY) to cross back over to the 200 day moving average (currently at $423.36 on SPY) before going long again? Should we be short right now, or cash?

11pif2s,Wan_Haole_Faka,"Trying to understand brokerage strategy of old, liquidated windfall

So at 32, I'm trying to avoid punishing myself for misusing a windfall I received at 22. Currently, I'm only beginning to build up my financial literacy and at 22, I had my head so far in the clouds and just completely rejected the modern financial system. Ten years later, here we are with two feet, trying to walk on the ground.

I inherited a taxable brokerage account with about $72,000 of assets, all individual stocks. This money was coming from my deceased grandfather who I never met and was managed by my estranged uncle. My uncle made quite the fortune as a day trader, but I'm under the impression that this account was more a ""buy and hold"" type strategy. I remember at the time, some of my family members explained to me that the stocks were all dividend paying stocks that were being reinvested and that compounding the interest on the dividends was desirable.

There were no mutual fund holdings, just five individual stocks. It was all biotechnology, pharma, tobacco and AT&amp;T was the only company I recall. It seems like this is decently diversified for individual stocks. But after reading about index fund investing, this approach seems highly aggressive and overly risky. I gather that some people focus on growth stocks versus dividend stocks, but for most people, mutual funds and target date funds seem to be the best investment strategy. 

I guess I'm curious about how much growth even matters with dividend stocks. In a portfolio like I one I inherited, even if the market was down for a few years, I understand that my holdings would lose value, but some of that would be made up for in dividends, correct?

Also, why was this a taxable brokerage and not a 529?

I'm not a high income earner by any means, but am wanting to learn more about different investment strategies and perhaps even learn about day trading. Mainly, I just want to see different opinions on the usage of a taxable brokerage account for building wealth before retirement. I opened up a Roth IRA last year and maxed the contributions. Current holdings are 85% VTSAX and 15% VXUS.

I've only skimmed through ""The Little Book of Common Sense Investing"", but am wondering about using individual stocks (likely dividend stocks) buffered with maybe VOO in a taxable account that I sort of gamble with. Can day trading be done on the side or is it really more of a full-time thing? I'm not gambling with my IRA, obviously.

My company doesn't provide a 401K but I'm planning on changing companies soon anyways.

I have an emergency fund with Ally and am slowly buying into I bonds so that I'll eventually have 50% of my emergency fund in I bonds.

I'm not clear on my financial goals honestly. I might go back to school, may end up with a mortgage within 5 years, who knows? If I need a new car I won't finance it.

I know this ended up being a very broad post, but I'd be curious about any insight you may have on my situation and specifically why this windfall I inherited was structured in the way it was.

129slz0,Wan_Haole_Faka,"Wealthfront Cash Acct vs Ally no Penalty CD vs VMFXX

I'm looking to minimize inflation losses on an emergency fund and used truck fund. I currently use Ally as a HYSA which I'm so glad I learned about! I'm challenged with some of the verbiage that seems to keep changing, or maybe it's just that I'm still new to the world of finance.

The Wealthfront cash account is yielding 4.3% currently. Is this just another name for a HYSA or is it an MMA? Also, is their automated investing account just a standard taxable brokerage?

The Ally no-penalty CD rate just dropped to 4.35% as has recently been in discussion here. My main question with that is this: say you withdraw your funds before the end of the 11-month term, do you still earn the amount of interest at that rate in proportion to the time it was invested?

Then my question with the Vanguard Federal money market fund (which seems to have good return) is about it seemingly having a higher risk. Am I correct in understanding that the return isn't guaranteed with a money market account? If this is a viable option, I don't fully understand how to utilize it. I don't have any kind of brokerage account, just a Roth IRA that is with Vanguard. Would contributing money to the MMF count towards my 2023 IRA contributions? Because I don't want it to. My intention for that is obviously different and I would lump sum invest that in about a year from now.

As far as looking for better returns with an emergency/vehicle fund, I've started to slowly buy into I bonds so that I don't have too much money locked up at once. I sort of wish I could invest more, but my car has 246,000 miles on it and I don't want to take out a loan. My credit is at 694 and I'll likely be in the rental market soon, so I don't think I want to risk taking the hit to my credit with a mostly unpaid loan at the moment. I would buy a used truck in cash only, if I'm thinking about this correctly.

I would greatly appreciate any insights you are willing to share. Thanks in advance and enjoy the rest of your weekend!

The two vehicles I'm deciding between are VMRXX and the Ally 11 month no-penalty CD.

The Ally CD is yielding 4.35% and I assume, if it were to be withdrawn early, you would earn the interest for the period of time it was invested in that vehicle.

What I find confusing about MMFs is the reason for the difference between the SEC yield and the 1/5/10 year average returns. For VMRXX, the SEC yield is 4.78%, but the one year average return is only 2.67%. So my question is what gives a better indicator of the profitability? I understand that MMFs pay dividends and not interest, but if the one year average return is only 2.67%, it seems like the no penalty CD from Ally is a better option.

13u6pt5,Wan_Haole_Faka,"Is an HSA worth it given the high deductible?

Hello Everyone,

My main investment account is a Roth IRA and I'm toying with the idea of opening an HSA next year. I almost did it this year, but I just couldn't justify it with the possibility that I'd have to pay an $8,000 deductible if something happened. The triple tax advantages are enticing and if I opened one, I'd keep it invested in a total stock market index fund and pay for medical expenses out of pocket. It's just challenging when you compare an $800 deductible to an $8,000 deductible.

I'm 32 and work for a plumbing company and currently gross $45K, which will go up as I gain experience (I'm newer to the trade). My health is pretty good, but I think health mostly depends on self-respect & self-discipline. I injured my lower back (not at work) about a year ago and was out for almost 2 months. A little before this, I was hospitalized for upper abdominal pain that went away on its own. Screening came back negative for gallstones.

As far as why I got a Silver, low-deductible health plan this year, I wanted to be able to get affordable therapy if I wanted it. I saw a therapist for a couple months (I was in a cult for 9 years, but I'm digressing) and I'm having a hard time getting my sessions covered even though they take my insurance which is meant to be a $20 copay. My point is that for now, I'm more inclined to seek no-cost support groups if I feel I need it and think I am open to having that higher deductible.

So, based on your experience with it and my situation, is an HSA worth it? My company doesn't provide a 401K, but I'm likely changing companies soon and will contribute up to the match.

I'm a 32 y/o 2nd year apprentice plumber who nets 35K annually. I'm a late bloomer and within the last two years learned most of what I know about managing money from r/personalfinance.

For a little background, I was in a cult for 9 years and severely mismanaged a windfall from my deceased grandfather's investments. In the last 3 years, I paid off 7K of capital gains tax and 6K of credit card debt after working in landscaping and attending trade school. Last year I opened an IRA and maxed my contributions in 85% VTSAX and 15% VTIAX.

I've learned a little about index fund investing and see the value of being consistent, not trying to beat the market all the time and not being caught up in the drama of what the economy is doing. I gather that most of the ""Bogle"" type investors see owning individual stocks as gambling. The problem is, I have a little more risk tolerance (for 1-3% of my income) and feel like I need to take some risks for greater reward. There's so much to learn. I don't necessarily want to study quarterly earnings reports, but I want to have one portfolio dedicated to a more aggressive approach with bigger name, well-known companies. I have other interests in education besides finance, but I am willing to dedicate a good chunk of time to learning how to go about all this. 

My expenses are fairly low. I live with a family member and will likely be changing jobs and moving soon. I expect to have a roommate. I drive an old Toyota, have an e fund (that I still need to grow) and a used car fund of about 14K. I have a car payment line item in my budget. Net worth (including retirement) is about 32K.

That said, I have some specific questions;

1) Is it a common approach to have a ""safe"" retirement account (i.e., 401K/IRA in index funds/target date fund) and a taxable brokerage for a more ambitious strategy? I have Vanguard for my IRA, but just realized they don't let you purchase fractional shares, so I'm looking into Fidelity. Thoughts?

2) The personal finance flowchart is all about saving for specific goals and putting most of your investments into retirement/HSA/529. It's all about delayed gratification, which I get. I just don't have a lot of specific goals, but I feel like I could make better use of a standard taxable brokerage for a small percentage of more aggressive investing, even if I don't mess with it for 5-10 years +. Is this a reasonable sentiment? I feel like if I ever want to realistically own a home/property and/or be financially independent, I need to take some more risks.

3) I have some half-baked ideas for diversifying an individual stock portfolio. I gather one would do well to include growth stocks, dividend stocks, defensive and blue chip. Altria seems like they will continue to provide consistent dividends. PXD seems to offer higher dividend potential, albeit inconsistent. Would it be so rash to throw in equal proportions of the two aforementioned with Apple, Amazon, Verizon, Cisco, Home Depot, Cat, 3m, Fedex, Netflix, Target, WM? In my mind, it makes sense to include different types of stocks from different sectors to hedge against downturn in any given sector.

4) I keep an E fund and other savings I need liquid in a MMF with a current SEC yield of 5.08% and 50% state tax exemption. I'm chomping at the bit to get a little cash in some of these companies, but does it make more sense to just hold extra cash in the MMF and wait until things get worse economically, or not so much? Are some stocks more immune to economic downturn such as Altria & Waste Management?

Lastly, based on my curiosities, what 1 or 2 books would you recommend to me about investing and building wealth? There's just so much out there! I really want to get a good bang for my buck because one can only read so much. I'm also studying plumbing code and Spanish, but I'm willing to put in the work to learn more about investing and finance.

I appreciate any tips or feedback you are willing to share with me.

Hi everyone,

I suppose this is more of a lifestyle and career question, but it has a lot to do with finance, so here we are. Clearly there's no one size-fits-all approach, but I'm a 32 y/o guy with no mouths to feed and am wondering about increasing and diversifying my income streams. I'll confess that I have a bit of a roundabout way of presenting information.

I'm a bit of a late bloomer and am nearly 1.5 years into a plumbing apprenticeship and really started adopting better financial habits about 2 years ago. I'm not interested in ""finding my passion"" or anything, but like all of us, I know we do better whilst leaning into our strengths. Getting into plumbing was about practicality for me and I guess it takes longer to really learn a trade than I thought. Sure, there will be better money down the road, but given the environmental toxins, I just don't know if it's what I want to do long-term. Last week I was replacing all of the water lines in an old house that had a leaking roof, no gutters and major humidity/mold issues everywhere. I enjoy learning and getting to be active, but I've been thinking a lot about diversifying my income streams, as I mentioned. I don't have to deal with the health ramifications of a sedentary lifestyle, but there are absolutely environmental concerns. 

I'm trying to decide how to block out my time/energy for education. I will list a few current as well as potential educational contenders.

1) Plumbing code/ technical aspects of trade: This can help to increase my earning potential and works towards my licensure. Granted, I can learn a lot of this just at work.

2) Potentially starting online, part-time degree, let's say in finance: I've felt empowered in learning about all aspects of finance and am looking at how and where I could potentially break into the industry, perhaps with FP&A or corporate finance. I was looking at IB but it seems very competitive, realistically. 

3) Spanish language: This one is sort of a toss-up between enjoyment and practicality. Yes, it may be one of the few things I enjoy, but is it really profitable to continue studying this amazing language? I'm at about a B1 level and am trying to see how I could leverage this skill for career advancement.

So here are some thoughts:

1) At my current net income of $34,848, maxing my IRA is investing just shy of 18% of my income. I didn't have any investments until last year. Currently, I could perhaps invest 25% of my income, utilizing either a taxable brokerage or a 401K from a different company I'll likely move to (current company offers no benefits except work vehicle).

2) I won't go into debt to go back to school. I haven't looked at the costs of part-time, online B.S. programs but for I feel like they could be fairly economical. I have some credits from 14 years ago but am not sure if they are still valid or not. To pay for all this, I'd likely have to back off from my arguably already deficient retirement investments. I'd be borrowing from my future self to \*perhaps\* increase my income or at least give me another career option. Is it worth it?

3) Am I spreading myself too thin to have any meaningful impact?

I'm fighting feelings of having wasted my 20's and am at a point where I'm willing to make sacrifices in the realms of leisure & romance to get to a point where I feel as though I have sovereignty over my life's trajectory. 

I'd appreciate any and all feedback or insights.

I'm in NC if it matters and loving the yields from MMFs right now for holding cash.

I'm not talking about people whose parents live with them, because that's obviously a different situation completely. I'm talking about folks that for one reason or another, have chosen to live with a parent/parents for financial reasons.

As a 32 year old man, I've gotten down on myself emotionally for living with my mother for the last 18 months. I offered her rent payments, but she adamantly refused to ever charge me. Long story short, I was in a cult for 9 years, got out, went to trade school and am now an apprentice plumber. I don't earn a lot, but in that time I've been able to pay off my entire 7K of CC debt, build an emergency fund of 3 months, open an IRA and max my contributions for two years, save up enough to buy my next car in cash and lastly start a tiny house downpayment fund in a brokerage acct. 

I've found that at my current pay and budget, I could afford $870/month in rent + utilities. However, the longer I can avoid having a housing payment, the longer that additional mensual $870 can be put towards Equities for owning a home as well as increasing my emergency fund & car fund.

16qkcmp,Wan_Haole_Faka,"Does it ever make sense to have multiple brokerage accounts?

I'd like to start by offering a bit of gratitude to this community. Two years ago (at 30), I found this sub and started gaining financial literacy. I began to realize how sheltered I had been from the importance of managing money. This realization was a catalyst for me leaving a high control ""spiritual"" group I was heavily involved with for 9 years, where I had given up my personal sovereignty. Terrible. So, I went to trade school, work in plumbing and have been investing for 18 months. Basically, without embellishing, this sub changed the trajectory of my life.

It became clear that this sub strongly endorses the index style of investing, so I found some of the Bogle literature and opened an IRA with Vanguard. My holdings are currently 90% VT, 10% AVUV and I intend to keep it mostly that way. I might diversify my SCV with another Avantis fund, but not more than 10% SCV total. I contribute $542/month, so this will be my second-year maxing contributions. 

In considering time horizons for different purposes, I realized that if I don't make a line item in my budget for a house downpayment and put it in treasuries or something, it will never happen. Even though it's controversial, I elected to invest these funds in equities for a 5-10+ year time horizon. If it's a bear market I'll just keep renting, whatever. I'm not comfortable borrowing from my IRA and I wouldn't do it from my 401K either if I had one. Basically, I opened a brokerage account with Vanguard and contribute like $80/month. Of course, I'll up that number soon, but that's where I am. My holdings are 65% VTI, 20% QQQM & 15% VXUS, but I'm having other ideas in line with value investing. 

To narrow down exactly what I'm asking, this account is for a specific purpose, a house. I have a separate chunk of money I keep in a MMF that is for buying my next car in cash, which will likely happen within the next 3 years. A set dollar amount each month goes into that account. My plan is that once I have to buy my next car, I'll immediately start INVESTING (not saving) the equivalent of a car payment each month. I'd be investing that money because I shouldn't need another car for 12-15 years. The crux of my question is: Does it make sense to keep this NEXT car fund money in a separate brokerage account from the home downpayment funds, or is it more practical if I lump it all together? I like the idea of having separate accounts for different purposes, but I wonder if I'd be missing out on some compounding gains by doing that. I don't know if the extra account would be worth the headache. 

Since I'm using more of the indexing approach with my IRA, I'll probably keep it with Vanguard. For the brokerage account, I've thought about moving it to Fidelity simply because they allow you to buy fractional shares. I don't like that Vanguard only lets you buy whole shares of non-Vanguard funds. I just ordered ""The Intelligent Investor"" and am planning on learning how to do a proper valuation. I want to build a portfolio of companies (and at least 50% VTWAX, I promise!) that are on sale. Some will likely be buy and hold for a long time, some may just be a couple or a few years if I decide to trim winners or write off losers. Something is always on sale.

I might not even keep my allocation of individual companies above 10%. If it does well, it'll fund my safer investments.

For various reasons, I just don't want to deal with the experience of an old car breaking down on me in any situation.

I have a tendency to look for things that are on sale, but that might be more of an approach for my taxable brokerage account. On that subject, my recently opened taxable brokerage is specifically for the intention of saving for a home downpayment that is 5-10 years off. For this reason, I don't believe that the 5-factor approach is appropriate. My main holdings are VTI @ 80%, VXUS @ 10% and cash @ 10%. The cash is essentially just dry powder in the event that I find funds or even individual value stocks on sale. I'm starting to learn about value investing and am comfortable using 10% of my taxable brokerage for this. Depending on how this goes, I may expand that percentage in the future or just use any results to underwrite safer investments._x000D_

I am deeply hoping to buy a house in 5-10 years. I don't have a 401k yet, but plan to switch jobs soon and contribute a little beyond the match.

Six months ago I started saving for this purpose in a taxable brokerage because I felt that it was silly to draw from retirement and negatively affect your compounding, but now I'm having second thoughts. Purely from a tax efficiency perspective, taking a 401k loan makea more sense I think, assuming you are contributing as much as possible with all your investing goals in mind. What do you think?

Also, I gather that with repaying this type of loan you pay a small amount of interest. Is this interest paid purely to your own 401K or to the broker? 

Any insights are appreciated.

vkho1z,Wan_Haole_Faka,"Wise to invest with rather minimal income?

I feel the desire to invest fairly aggressively (30% of my income) even though I'm not earning a ton. My expenses however are pretty low.

I'm a 31 year old first year plumber's apprentice and take home roughly $32,000 annually, plus the perhaps monthly production bonus and occasional overtime. That number should be increasing soon though because I'm driven and spend my weekends learning code, studying the trade and am starting to do side jobs, which increases my bottom line and experience faster. I'm trying to increase my value as fast as possible.

I was in a clingy so-called ""spiritual"" group (Christian-flavored Andean Shamanic practices) for 9 years, got into some CC debt and ultimately found the lifestyle lacking in trust and unsustainable. Debt is somewhat old, I'm in the process of validating it now. Less than $7,000 overall. Will negotiate pay for deletion if they have their ducks in a row, but my credit isn't completely suffering. I am an authorized user on a couple accounts and have one secured card that is keeping my fico 8 score around 616 and will only improve, even if I do nothing about the debt (however I plan to act on it).

I don't pay rent as I currently live with my mother and am grateful for that, but obviously want my own place. However I can't afford to live where I work. Lifestyle inflation will not be a problem for me, regular inflation is already crazy. I have no problem buying good model cars with 150,000 miles on them when the old one craps out. I don't want to just save and wait until I get paid more. I'm wondering if aggressive investing will be my best move. Money sitting is just being lost anyways. We don't have direct deposit so I can't capitalize on Porte's 3% APY savings account. Even so, you're just losing less money. I found some 6 month 6 CDs at 1.28% that I may try to purchase every month, but even that's a very defensive move.

Honestly I need help. I feel like I'm trying to play catch-up with my life.

I have a lot to learn about investing but whatever I do will be diverse. I'm thinking a buy and hold method since I don't want to be monitoring stuff each day. Been looking at index funds, tech stocks, growth stocks, amazon, 3m, blue chip stocks, etc. Don't want to invest in tobacco, pharma or biotech. People say not to invest emotionally, but to me it's not emotional, rather moral, for lack of a better word. I know I'm not making a lot right now, but I could see myself investing 30% of what I make consistently with a good strategy along with increasing my value, I am optimistic. I'd love to hear any advice from this community. Thanks in advance!

w0ptf4,Wan_Haole_Faka,"ETFs versus Index funds for IRA and Brokerage account

Hi all,

I'm days away from paying off all my credit card debt and plan on opening a Vanguard IRA very soon and likely a regular brokerage account soon thereafter.

I'm attracted to index funds because as I understand it, those investments dissuade you from emotional trading. I don't know how this works but perhaps there are transaction fees that aren't associated with ETFs? The only reason I'm really even considering ETFs is to be able to diversify my portfolio in the beginning.

For example, if I were to max out a new Roth IRA for the first year, I'd probably buy half in VTSAX and half in VITAX. But I feel like that's too high of a percentage in the international market and wouldn't be able to address it until the following year. If I open a brokerage account, I'd probably start with the same two funds and although index funds are by nature, diverse, is it wise to hold the exact same things in all your investment accounts? If I were to modify my potential holdings, maybe I'd be conservative the first year with my IRA and do half VBTLX half VTSAX. I assume VBTLX also has a $3,000 buy in minimum? With index funds for more modest investors, is it always sort of clumsy in the beginning until you have enough invested that you can diversify?

Additionally, a random thought about I bonds: It looks like VFIAX has a 7.8% profitability and VTSAX has about 8.2%. Obviously there's other factors at play, but to my untrained eye, it looks like I bonds are even more profitable than these funds if you buy in at the right time to be able to get a sense of projected interest rates. Thoughts?

For some background I'm 31, take home $32,000 annually, have low expenses currently and if I'm not earning $100,000 a year from my job in 4 years, something is seriously wrong. It's unlikely that I'll go back to school, but not outside the realm of possibility.

z3nhgn,Wan_Haole_Faka,"Lifestyle choices, IRA contributions and family support

Hi Everyone,

This will be a sort of circuitous financial/life advice-seeking post.

I am a single 31 year old male and am currently living with a parent. Long story short I never made the mental connection of getting my feet on the ground in regards to a career and finances until recently.

I'm wanting to live alone but am wondering if it's too early. I just paid off all my debt and earn $40,000 gross annually as an apprentice plumber. I went to a brief trade school for service plumbing 9 months ago and have been employed in the trade ever since. I may have to change companies to be valued and learn with more experienced professionals. As long as I'm working in plumbing my goal is to be licenced if only for purposes of wage negotiating power. Another reason I may need to change companies is because they don't offer health or dental. They seem to want to pay their employees just enough to be able to live with a working spouse and qualify for Medicaid and in some cases, subsidized housing.

I'm also considering going back to school to study Spanish and/or something related to conflict resolution. If I do this I'd likely attend night/weekend/online courses while working full-time. Chances are I would accept tuition help offered from family 

I was also recently offered my first ever paid writing gigs through Freelancer, a path I haven't gone down yet, but there's potential for that type of side job. I usually work weekend side jobs doing various labor/handyman type things.

I have $17k in savings and about $2,500 in an IRA that I just opened this year. My car is a make and model known for longevity but has 245,000 miles on it. My savings is kind of like an emergency fund but also a down payment for a used truck.

My IRA is just a standard 3 fund portfolio. I'd like to max it each year, especially given that I have no 401k, but I'm now also questioning if I should even max it each year.

I don't have any other investments due to being a low income earner and also because I need to keep my assets relatively liquid. I've procrastinated in opening a HYSA, but it's on the list. I'm also planning on slowly buying into I-Bonds with the goal of building up 50% or so of my emergency fund to be inflation protected.

I wouldn't say I'm miserable cohabitating with dear parental companionship, in fact I'm grateful for the opportunity to be able to save a little money despite the harsh reality check of being in my situation. I sort of feel like an entitled fellow saying this, knowing that in many cultures, 4 generations of family live together in undersized accomodations and build a decent amount of wealth, I just want my own space. Perhaps I'm like every other Westerner.

I realize that this is very personal to each individual, but I'm trying to be realistic about what to prioritize. It's hard to find a studio-type apartment in my area for under $1,100. I earn $2,600/mo. after taxes which clearly makes this difficult. I'm also currently uninsured. As I mentioned, I usually have side income and also get performance bonuses most paychecks, but I don't find it realistic to build a budget around that type of income.

I'm in a space where I'm trying to decide if I'll pursue something that is allegedly lucrative after bearing a process of a few years and find fulfilment in other things or if I should pursue something more fulfilling to me. I know this is borderline r/careeradvice, but here we are.

Is it too early for me to move out if I want to keep maxing my IRA? Is it worth it to potentially trade my IRA contributions for a little more peace in my life?

I appreciate any and all advice. Please be completely honest.

pqyny1,wannafightabout_it,"Can someone review my retirement strategy and tell me if this would work the way I think it would?

Hi all,

I'm interested in early retirement.

\- I'm 37.  
\- I have $225,000 in my 401k.  
\- My salary is \~$108,000.  
\- I max out my 401k at $19,500, my HSA at $3,600, and my Roth IRA at $6,000 = \~$30k / year (or $2,500 / month).  
\- My expenses are about $30k / year.

I would like to know if my plan makes any sense. According to this Coast Fire calculator ([https://walletburst.com/tools/coast-fire-calc/](https://walletburst.com/tools/coast-fire-calc/)), if I put in the information above + a retirement age of 52, then it indicates that I would reach my Coast Fire goal in 8 years, at age 45.

Aside from my 401k/HSA/Roth saving over the next 8 years, if I also saved $27,000 / year in cash (or something safe), then I should also have $216,000 in my account after those 8 years. 

So at that point, rather than just work to cover bills from age 45 to 52 like one would typically do in Coast Fire, couldn't I use $30k / year from the $216,000 bucket? That would cover the 7 years between ages 45 and 52. Then at 52, I would be at my FIRE goal.

Also, starting at age 47 (five years before 52), I would leverage a Roth Conversion Ladder from my 401k/Traditional IRA each year to bridge the gap from ages 52 to 60.

So effectively, I'm wondering if I could retire in 8 years at age 45 if I continue to contribute \~$30k/year to my retirement accounts and \~30k/year to a bank account for those 8 years?

Am I missing something big or does what I'm suggesting make some sense?

My and my wifeâ€™s W-4s are not at all coordinated. We file jointly and have two children but thereâ€™s no indication of that on either of our W-4s. Problem #1.

I switched jobs a few months back and so not only is my W-4 not aligned with my situation, but I have two jobsâ€™ worth of wages to work through. Granted, the IRS calculator helps with this, so itâ€™s not my biggest issue, but still an added layer of complexity.

In addition, next year weâ€™re both planning to make some fairly significant adjustments to our HSA, DC-FSA, and 401k contributionsâ€¦ + I might be getting a bonus.

So Iâ€™m wanting to just leave things as they are for 2021, get a way-bigger-than-I-should refund, but get the W-4 squared away for January 2022.

But how do I do that? The IRS calculator is for 2021 (not 2022), it asks for pay stub and YTD information which I donâ€™t have for 2022, it asks about federal tax withholdings, which I donâ€™t know, etc. I tried to pretend my situation for next year is what it is for this year (when using the calculator) but 2021 was weird and numbers were different just this year (e.g., the Child Tax Credit amongst other things), so Iâ€™m not sure how accurate it is.

Can anyone offer some advice for how to figure out what my W-4 should look like based on what I know the salary and contribution situation will be next year?

pzzztx,wannafightabout_it,"Did I make a mistake with 2021 dependent care FSA vs Tax Credit.

Hi, anyone who is familiar with this subject for the 2021 year knows that there are a lot of factors (like AGI, daycare costs, etc.) that go into whether itâ€™s worth contributing to a DC FSA or just taking the DC credit at the end of the yearâ€¦

I just wanted to try to simplify my situation to see if I chose the â€œwrongâ€ path. My daycare expenses for 2 kids are $10,400 / yearâ€¦

I did what I did in 2020 which was sign up to contribute $5,000 to my DC FSA.

I know the DC FSA (and tax credit limit) was raised to $10,500 but my employer didnâ€™t allow for the mid-year change. Regardless, I changed jobs mid year and my new employerâ€™s limit is also $5,000â€“so I signed up for that full amount (crunched into my remaining paychecks). So that means my total contribution for the year will be the $2,500 I claimed from my previous employer + the $5,000 from my current employer = $7,500.

So yes this reduces my taxable income by $7,500 and I can also subtract that from my daycare costs (I think). $10,400 - $7,500 = $2900, and assuming Iâ€™m right at the $125k AGI, I think it would be $2900 * .50 = $1,450 credit.

Does that sound right?

If so, I think itâ€™s a question of whether the $7,500 marginal tax savings + $1,450 credit is higher than if I had just not done a DC FSA at all and just claimed a $5,200 credit ($10,400 * .50)

Also, Iâ€™m in New York State. Can anyone tell at a quick glance whether the Credit path wouldâ€™ve been better?

Bonus: our AGI for the entirety of next year (2022) will be quite a bit higher than this year, so if the dependent care limits return to what they were for 2022, is there a clear winner for which path to chooseâ€¦?

q5aqng,wannafightabout_it,"Can/Should I use a Traditional IRA as a funnel to my Traditional 401k?

In my three jobs so far, I've always contributed to a Traditional 401k. When I left my first job, I rolled the 401k balance into a Traditional IRA that has just been sitting there for a while. I had opened up a Roth IRA shortly after and just contributed to that over the years without much thought other than I've already paid the tax on the money so it'll grow tax free and I can access it in retirement tax free.

So fast forward to now where I've started to look more closely at my finances. I'm at an income level of $100k+ and collectively, my wife and I are comfortably in the 22% tax bracket but I could see us eventually crossing the direct Roth IRA contribution threshold, so I've decided to roll my Traditional IRA (my former 401k money) into my 401k (which allows roll ins) and close my Traditional IRA account so that I don't have any basis in a Traditional IRA in case we want to do a backdoor Roth conversion.

So that leaves me with a Traditional 401k and a Roth IRA. My plan was that, going forward, I would max each of these out and be set up for a Backdoor Roth Conversion if necessary....great. But then I thought to myself, aside from the inherent diversification of having both Traditional and Roth retirement accounts, why am I mixing and matching the tax advantaged accounts? It would seem, if I opened a new Traditional IRA and maxed out that instead of the Roth IRA, I would be able to

1. Take the $6,000 deduction (even if I take the standard deduction), which I can't take now if I'm contributing to a Roth IRA.
2. Immediately roll in the $6,000 I contribute to the Traditional IRA at the beginning of each year into my 401k so that my Traditional IRA balance stays at $0 in case I ever want to leverage a Backdoor Roth conversion (only paying tax on the amount converted and nothing else, which is what would've been the case if I had made direct Roth contributions of the same amount anyway).

I think my new plan would be to max out my Traditional 401k (and HSA) as planned, stop contributing to my Roth IRA and instead max out a Traditional IRA and roll it into my 401k each year, take the additional $6k tax deduction ($20,500 401k + $6k tIRA + $3,650 1/2 Family HSA = $36,150), and my remaining money after the $36,150 pretax deductions + expenses (bills, etc.) would go right into a Brokerage account. And it's this Brokerage account that would act as the one to help diversify the portfolio (instead of the Roth IRA) as it's post-tax money + very liquid/accessible, etc.

And if I decide to focus only on contributing to my Traditional IRA and funnel the contributions into my 401k, then the Roth IRA thresholds never come into play and then a backdoor Roth is kind of a moot point...

Is my understanding correct in that I can use my Traditional IRA to funnel money to my 401k and leave the possibility open for me to do a backdoor Roth conversion? 

And do you agree that this would be a good move to change my strategy from maxing out my Roth IRA to maxing out a Traditional IRA (and moving the money into the 401k), then leveraging a Brokerage account?

I hope that all made sense. I'm not an expert here, so that's why I'm looking for your opinions/guidance.

I originally started to describe this long what-if scenario, but then I realized that my question isn't that involved (I don't think).

1) Retire and show much less income and claim the children as dependents.  
2) Keep working and claim the children as dependents.  
3) Don't claim the children as dependents and try to max financial aid offering.  
4) If income or 529 balance is high enough, just pay

Hi, this may be a dumb question but hereâ€™s the situation.

Hi, the short of my situation is that Iâ€™m trying to roll the balance of my Fidelity Traditional IRA into my fidelity-managed 401k (I have my reasons and my plan allows for roll ins).

Apparently theyâ€™ve wired the moneyâ€”it has left the IRA but not yet been deposited into the 401k. This was at the end of last week, so Iâ€™m willing to give it a few days to (hopefully) completed and get in the 401k account. However, I noticed in the activity log of the IRA, it shows:

Super long story (kinda) short, I've been trying to move the balance of my Traditional IRA to my Traditional 401k for several weeks (it accepts roll ins). I created a Rollover Request (I think that's like a digital deposit slip) for the correct amount. They sent a check from the one department to the other. Fast forward two weeks, the money never made its way to my 401k....so they had to cancel the check and adjust my IRA balance again. Second shot was a wire transfer. Money never made its way to my 401k. Third attempt I just asked them to send me a a check made payable to Fidelity FBO my name. This way, I could just upload it via the NetBenefits app and have some control of the situation. This is essentially the process I needed to follow when I moved a 403b over, so I'm familiar with it. It still seems silly that I need to request a check from Fidelity made out to Fidelity and sent to me just so I can be sure it gets where it needs to be.

Anyway, today I get the check! I try to snap a front and back image with the NetBenefits app, and of course I get an error ""Couldn't capture image. We've encountered an error on our end. Please try again"". I mean, it clearly took photos of the front and back. The check is in perfect condition (and again, issued by Fidelity itself).

I called Fidelity and, as nice as the people were, they were able to offer almost no help at all. No one knew why it was happening and no one could escalate me to the technical team or a department that could help me through why their app (or something on my account) isn't working. I checked on another device too--same issue.

They keep suggesting I mail in the check, but that's exactly what I'm trying to avoid--then it's out of my control again and in the hands of the post office and Fidelity again, and I have to hope that in 10 business days they do what they're supposed to--otherwise here comes another check cancellation and adjustment (and back to square one).

Do I have any other options? I mean, I'll try the app each day for the next few days, but would a branch be able to process this for me? Can I somehow try the regular Fidelity app deposit feature to see if I can get it into my Cash Management account and then move it from there (that sounds like a bad idea as I type it, but something like that)?

Hi,

I have the opportunity to contribute to my employer's Employee Stock Purchase Plan at a 15% discount.

Yes, paying short-term capital gains tax, but still ultimately benefiting.

I'm wondering about my situation. As I mentioned, my employer offers a 15% discount, which is great. However, it's a requirement that I not sell stock for at least six months after purchasing it--and if I want to sell it just after that period, I have to notify my employer that I'm selling the stock (and pay the commissions on the sale). It would also be considered a disqualifying disposition, so my basis would be higher and I would pay more in short-term capital gains tax.

sf5d1j,whothefuckcares123,"I want to buy our next home smartly but I'm not really sure where to start...

The only property I have bought was my last condo. I bought that without kids in mind so I didn't even remotely look at schools, I didn't look at property taxes, it didn't need half the inspections a house does, and honestly, I just bought what I wanted.

We want to move to the Chicago suburbs now and I'd like this to be our long term family house where we raise kids hopefully for the next 20 years. With that in mind, I'd like to buy something where the taxes preferably aren't very high and the schools are great (are those opposites?). I want to buy in an area that is an evaluated choice.

But I feel like I'm missing something... The taxes around Chicago all seem relatively the same where I'm looking (Oakbrook-ish area for the most part, some over the boarder in Indiana (Crowne point, etc)) and yet my friend in Oakbrook was saying how she moved up the street just a few blocks and was completely overwhelmed with her new house tax bill. This is confusing to me and makes me feel like I'm missing something because when I look at property taxes online for her area, I'd think they should have been the same (despite house cost, of course).

I make $40,669 a year and would like to set up my elections to contribute 81% of my paychecks so that I can have about $16k in my 2023 401k before I start being a stay at home mom in July.

However, when I put into the system that I make $40,669 a year, it won't let me increase my contribution to more then 50.4% for a total of $10,250 (because over a year that totals to $20,500)

When I lie to the system and tell it that I make only $20,344 a year, I can set it to contribute 81% of my paycheck like I would like. However, I'm not sure if John Hancock deducts from my paycheck based off solely the percentage (meaning it would take out 81% of my $40,669 paychecks for a total of about $16k by mid year) or whether it deducts a dollar amount each month based off ( $20,344 / 12 ) \* .81, which would result in only $8239.32 being inserted by mid year.

vvup22,wolfieofwallstreet,"Was charged ~twice for the same charge- CC reversed the the temporary credit

**Intro**

I reserved a boat for my trip to Italy on Click and Boat (first time using it, basically like airbnb for boats). Was charged $188 for 8 hours for a specific boat to my my Capital One Venture X. Great, no problem. 

&amp;#x200B;

**Rental Day**

The day of the rental, I go to the boat company and the guy tells me the rental is for half day and for $145 and said the full day was not available for my specific boat. I'm fine with half day rental instead so I agree and he charges my cc. I forgot that I had already been charged the $188. So I rent the boat for half day and return. 

&amp;#x200B;

**The dispute**

I figured I would just do a dispute for the $188 and be done, which is what i did. In the mean time, I also had emailed Click and Boat and told them the situation and asked for a refund, and they agreed with me and said the merchant also agreed with the me on the situation as well and was willing to do a refund. This is where it gets pretty sketch. Click and Boat told me to give them my bank account number so the merchant could wire my refund. I paid with my CC originally so i told them wtf no just refund my CC transaction. Click and Boat then said the merchant already talked to me privately and wired the money to my bank account. I asked for proof and they sent me some sketchy whatsapp screenshot of the merchant talking to some random person that was not me. I figured at this point, this was super sketch, so I stopped responding to Click and Boat and waited to let Capital One settle things out. Just got an email saying the case was closed and that ""the merchant provided confirmation showing no cancellation per policy was received"" and they charged the $188 back to my account.

Plan/rationale: 

In summer 2023, I am hoping to either:

a) purchase a duplex (or 3 or 4 plex) 

b) purchase a townhome/house/condo if no multifamily properties are available

If option a, then I will rent out the other unit. If option b, then I will rent out once I move in 2025. Is it reasonable to use a VA loan for this purchase (with 0? down) and then do the following after I move:

a) change the loan type to a traditional one

b) keep the VA loan as is and use a physician loan at my next duty station to acquire a second property

My longterm plan is to continue to purchase properties and rent out the other units and rinse and repeat the above as I move each time. I don't plan on being a long distance landlord (will probs be fine be a local landlord)- will just hire a management company so I dont have to deal with the tenants and lose a bit of profit.

h7e6bj,Workaphobia,"401(k) loans and ""double taxation""

Some sites warn that if you take out a loan from your 401(k), the money you repay will be taxed twice. Others claim that this is a myth, and that the net effect on taxes is the same as if you took the loan from somewhere else. And others claim that double taxation is real, but only for the interest and not principal.

Would it be fair to say the following?

- The money *is* taxed twice, once when you earn the money to make loan payments, and again when you withdraw it in retirement.

- This matches how you pay ordinary loans with after-tax money, and how you would be taxed anyway on other withdrawn 401(k) earnings besides loan interest (i.e., if your portfolio had invested in stocks instead of in ""you"").

I'm unclear on what the distinction between principal and interest is for tax purposes. For the pro rata rule, assuming all your contributions to the 401(k) are originally pretax, is the repaid principal still treated as pre-tax when you withdraw, and the interested treated as earnings?

ie1p8c,Workaphobia,"When closing on a house purchase, confirm the actual payments match the billed costs

Let's say you buy a house for $500k (fake numbers), and your mortgage is $400k (20% down). You get a whole bunch of forms estimating your closing costs as $20k, broken out to different vendors and paid variously by you, the title company, and the bank.

On closing week, your lawyer gives you a breakdown of what the bank wired over and how it's being distributed. They wired $395k (your mortgage minus fees and interest paid to the bank, unitemized), then money was taken out for the bank's own lawyer and for the mortgage recording tax that the bank pays, leaving $390k to go towards your purchase. You're responsible for paying the seller the $110k balance, in addition to whatever you owe the title company.

But how do you know the bank didn't shortchange you? It'd be easy to deduct an extra $2k in bogus fees from the wire without you realizing, and then you'd be paying the seller $2k more than you should, while still owing the same on your mortgage. Without itemization, you don't have anything to go by but your loan officer's word.

In my case, answering the question of where they came up with the $395k figure took two lawyers, a calculator, and fifteen minutes at closing.

ivdqhe,Workaphobia,"Some hypotheticals on Roth conversions

I've been looking at the math on whether it's advantageous to do conversions from Traditional IRA to Roth. This is just looking at the final after-tax money **while ignoring tax brackets, RMDs, tax implications for beneficiaries, and assuming no withdrawal penalties.** My conclusions:

1. If you're paying the taxes out of the IRAs themselves, the Roth conversion doesn't make a difference.

2. It's strictly better to pay the taxes out of taxable accounts. If you do that, *Roth conversions are better because you pay the taxes sooner*. If you instead let it grow in the traditional IRA, you'll have to pay taxes on the grown value using non-tax-advantaged funds that haven't kept up.

Here's the math. Let's suppose you have $100k in a Traditional IRA and $50k in a taxable brokerage account. All ordinary and capital gains taxes are 25%, and the growth of all investments over a decade is 100%. Cap gains aren't realized until the end.

**Scenario 1:** If you just let everything sit for a decade, you have $200k in the Trad IRA and $100k in the brokerage. After paying ordinary income on the IRA and cap gains on the growth in the brokerage, you have $150k + $87.5k = $237.5k. Nice chunk of change.

**Scenario 2:** You convert the Trad to Roth, taking a distribution of some of the Trad to cover taxes on the whole maneuver while leaving the brokerage alone. That's $25k in taxes, leaving $75k for the Roth. After a decade, you have a $150k Roth and $87.5k brokerage = $237.5k overall. You're no better or worse off.

**Scenario 3:** You convert the whole $100k to Roth, liquidating half your brokerage to pay taxes. After a decade, you have a $200k Roth and your brokerage has grown to $43.75k after taxes, giving you $243.75k at the end. This is a win over both of the above strategies.

The point is that you want to sacrifice the non-tax-advantaged accounts for the sake of the tax-advantaged ones, and do it sooner rather than later, before the relatively worse growth has time to weigh you down.

Of course, this assumes you have the taxable funds handy and that there's some breathing room in your tax bracket. *It also ignores the fact that you could be paying lower cap gains rates on your taxable accounts.*

n7yc2t,Workaphobia,"How do taxable tax refunds work?

Suppose that in 2019 you withhold $10k in state taxes, but your state tax liability is only $9k. Also suppose that you itemize, so you deduct state taxes off your federal return.

You get a state refund of $1k in 2020 for the 2019 tax year. As I understand it, that refund is supposed to be taxable in 2020 (reported via 1099-G), to avoid over-deducting money you didn't actually pay. Effectively, you defer the tax on the $1k by one year instead of bypassing tax altogether.

For that to make sense, you'd have to have reduced your 2019 federal income by $10k rather than by the actual liability of $9k. But why? I suppose it's because your $10k in withholding is what's reflected in your W-2. But don't we have all the information we need at the time the federal return is filed, so couldn't we have somehow corrected the deduction to $9k?

rkw9w2,Workaphobia,"Thoughts on leveraging home equity

I'm opening a HELOC and wanted to bounce my thoughts off this community. There's two main goals:

1. Safety net to supplement my rainy day fund, e.g. in case of loss of income. (I understand the lender may close the credit line in case of loss of employment, but that's why it doesn't replace the rainy day fund.)

2. (Re)finance past and upcoming home improvement projects that I could pay off out of pocket, but would prefer not to. For this I'd do a fixed rate lock over 6 or 12 years, at around 2.6% or 3% respectively.

To elaborate on 2, I like the safety net of liquidity, and I'm expecting my cashflow to improve in a few years (cutting out preschool for two kids, and phasing in a multi-year raise from work). I also expect interest rates to rise or at least not fall, and inflation to possibly ramp up, so taking on more fixed debt now seems reasonable.

I'm thinking of managing the debt by opening up a separate brokerage account for the disbursed funds. I'd invest in something conservative like short-term treasuries or investment-grade corp bonds, the idea being to lower my cost of borrowing by a percent or so. I'd pay back the loan in equal installments, not interest-only. When I take on new projects they'd be funded from that account.

s413lt,Workaphobia,"Is popular wisdom about umbrella coverage just wrong?

When I look at various online calculators for umbrella coverage, including Geico's app, they seem to be based largely on your net worth.

This makes no sense to me - shouldn't it be based on your expected liability? If my net worth is $500k, and I think a reasonable risk is that I'm sued for $5M, wouldn't I want liability coverage for the latter and not the former?

s8s4fq,Workaphobia,"What's the tipping point for when it's worthwhile to file a homeowners claim?

I've got a $1k deductible and some ceiling water damage from a failed p-trap. Still don't know the total out of pocket cost I'll pay, but I'm getting varying numbers for when it becomes worth it to file a homeowners claim. The plumbers suggested $3-4k, my family said $2k, and the insurance company representative suggested $10-15k (figures).

When I look online for how much my premiums might rise, it sounds like ~20% is a typical or worst case scenario, while [this page](https://www.insurancequotes.com/home/home-insurance-claim) suggests that in my state (NY) ~1% is more likely. My annual premium right now is $2k, so even at 20% that's only $400 dollars a year. If we assume it stays on my record for 5-7 years, that's $2000 to $2800 total cost in raised premiums. So that would seem to indicate it's worth my while if the repair bill is $3-4k.

Does my reasoning seem sound? Can anyone share how much their premiums rose after a non-catastrophic, non-weather homeowners claim?

Also, the insurance company said that I had to file a claim in order to start the process of even sending an adjuster over. So it sounds like just seeing what they'll offer me will commit me to that approach.

**Edit:** The plumber was just a little under a grand, far better than I was hoping, for four hours of work (including one trip to home depot). So it sounds like the total work with drywall won't be enough to justify a claim.","Anchoring, Loss Aversion, Framing Effect, Status Quo Bias","The user's analysis of whether to file a homeowners claim is influenced by several biases. The varying estimates provided by the plumber, family, and insurance company representative serve as anchors, influencing the user's perception of the tipping point for filing a claim. The user's focus on the potential increase in premiums (~1% vs. 20%) and the calculation of the total cost in raised premiums over 5-7 years indicates a loss aversion bias, as they are weighing the potential losses (increased premiums) against the potential gain (avoiding out-of-pocket costs). The framing effect is also present, as the user is influenced by the way the information is presented (e.g., the insurance company's suggestion of a high threshold for filing a claim). Additionally, the user's reluctance to file a claim, as evidenced by their consideration of not filing due to a lower-than-expected repair bill, suggests a status quo bias, where they prefer to maintain the current situation (not filing a claim) unless strongly compelled to change.","The user exhibits a tendency to be influenced by initial information and framing, while also being risk-averse and hesitant to deviate from the status quo when making financial decisions."

So in July of 2019, I started a consulting company, single member LLC.  Most of my contracts are paid on a 1099 for my time.  Knowing that I was going to have a large contract coming in January 2020, with a large bonus that was all but guaranteed due to how well things were going, I decided to file using accrual method for 2019 to minimize the amount of taxes I would pay in 2020 since often times I get paid 1-2 months after I bill out for services.

Fast forward to 2020.  I not only had the large bonus, but several other contracts that came to fruition, but between filing taxes for 2019 and now working on this year's taxes, I'm thinking I made a mistake.  I should have filed using cash method since right now, the 1099's never match up with my annual income and there is no way to ""check my math"" so to speak.

Tl;DR:  I was an idiot and invested in things I didn't fully understand.  Made a  lot of decent money, but don't understand any of the tax implications of it, or even when I will get my tax forms.

So I graduated from residency in 2019 and in 2020 I started managing my own brokerage accounts as I became self employed (in 2019).  Previously I had a 403(b) through the hospital and no extra disposable income to invest.

I'm more on the right path now, and have most of my holdings in boring index funds, but I understand that each stock I bought and sold will be taxed at my ordinary income rate of 35%.  I also bought some investments  I didn't really understand (REITs, LPs, Futures, etc) that I now understand won't just show up on a 1099 brokerage tax statement.

Is there any way to know what forms to expect and when I'm ""done"" receiving forms and can file my taxes?

lu2vt4,WuMedic,"Does Making an Auto Insurance Claim Cause Your Rates to Go Up Regardless of Fault?

I was reading the thread that was pretty popular yesterday or the day before about someone getting dropped from homeowners insurance for making multiple claims and I was wondering if that was the case with auto insurance as well?

I drive many miles to get to and from work (100-150 miles round trip) so it's unsurprising that over the years I've gotten into a few accidents.  (I'm also a member of a volunteer fire department, so we take a driving class every year, but even watching out for other people's mistakes, there's only so much you can do to avoid an accident sometimes!)  I had one at fault accident 14+ years ago, but never had another at fault accident since then.  I have had a few non-at fault incidents though (parked car backed into by someone I knew who let me know, parked car involved in a hit and run caught on camera-owner found with police help, car side swiped by a semi on a highway, car pulled out against a red light in front of me, rear-ended by a car on a freeway as I slowed down to avoid debris, side swiped by a pickup who failed to check his blind spot changing lanes).

However, when I do get into an accident, I've never contacted my own insurance company, and just work with the other person's insurance company directly so my insurance company won't find out about it.  The other day, a friend of mine got me thinking as he rode in my car for the first time and saw my dashcam setup.  I had mentioned that it makes claims when someone else is at fault really easy--I told him I send the other guy's insurance company the video footage and the discussion quickly goes from ""are you sure he's at fault, let's wait for all of the police paperwork"" to ""OK, how much is the damage and where do you want the check sent?""

His response was: ""Why are you working with the other guy's insurance? Submit your claim to your own insurance and let them sort it out with the other guy's insurance!  That's what you're paying them for!""

So I guess my questions are these:

1. If I am not at fault, will submitting the claim through my own insurance cause my rates to go up?
2. If I submit the claim through my own insurance, will I have to pay my deductible and any not covered expenses (rental car, missed work) out of pocket?  Or do they go after the other party for the full amount?

So I am having a bit of difficulty figuring out how much I can contribute to each.

In 2020, I had a 403(b) through a part time job, and a SEP-IRA through my consulting business.  I was under the impression that the contribution limits were separate.  I could have $57,000 towards my SEP and \~$19,000 for my 403 (b) (not sure what the hard max was for the 403(b) because my employer only matched up to 4% so that's what I elected.

in 2021, I will still have the SEP-IRA and 403(b), but I will pick up a second part time job that has a 401(k) option.  However, I was told during orientation to be careful about this as apparently most part time casual places do not offer 401(k)'s for their employees, but since this one does, they have run into issues with hitting aggregate limits for people with multiple jobs.  I am wondering what exactly these aggregate limits are.

m7ens1,WuMedic,"How to Find a Tax Advisor/CPA (x-post r/tax)

TL;DR - I have a plan outlined below for filing my very complicated taxes this year.  Is it a good one?  Also, how do I find a CPA/Tax person who can do what I need them to do/who I know I can trust?

So in 2019 I finished my medical residency program and now work a variety of jobs.  I have an LLC which all of my self-employment consulting income goes through, a couple of W-2 jobs (Direct patient care), and some investments.  My 2019 taxes were a bit complicated, but I was able to import most things through quickbooks.  I had a couple of W-2's to input but I did not have to input any 1099's due to me filing on accrual basis (more on this later).  I decided to learn everything on my own for my own knowledge, plus it helped me identify how I might be able to change how I do some things in order to try and save on taxes.

In 2020, I started some investment accounts and this is where things get wonky.  This year, I have in addition to my W-2 and 1099's/business income, a ""combined"" statement from Schwab with my 1099-B, 1099-INT, and 1099-DIV.  I also have at least 2 K-1's one of which has something about contracts and straddles, and another one which seems to have 3 nested K-1's ""Supplemental K-1 Information statement for tax year 2020""  While last year was quite a bit for me to learn about taxes, this year, it seems like an insurmountable obstacle and I have spent way more time than I should have working on my taxes.  I did it myself last year to try and learn things own my own, but I'm not sure any of the knowledge I would gain from figuring this out own my own is worth the extra time I'm sinking into this.

&amp;#x200B;

To recap, I have:

\- 3 W-2's- Business income, single member LLC from Quickbooks import (4 1099-NEC's but I don't use them since I file under accrual basis)- A handful of 1099-INTs from savings accounts- A combined 1099-B/DIV/INT from my brokerage account- A 1099-G for unemployment income (3 weeks worth when a bunch of us were furloughed at the beginning of the pandemic)- A K-1 that's relatively straightforward- A K-1 that's not straightforward and has a ""Supplemental K-1 Information statement"" that appears to have 3 nested K-1's- Maybe other K-1's that I'm not even aware of yet

My plan is to:

\- File an extension myself to give myself until October 15th to figure all of this out- On April 15th, pay the amount that Turbo Tax says I owe, knowing this is likely an estimate because the likelihood of me inputting everything correctly, especially the investment stuff is pretty close to 0.- Hire a CPA/Tax Preparer to review my tax filings (or if it's easier just start from scratch) sometime after April 15th (I don't want them to feel rushed since I now have less than a month to file, plus I want to take my time in finding someone)- Ask that same person to file the paperwork to change my filing basis from accrual to cash.  This way, my 1099's line up with my business income.  (I had initially filed accrual basis as the first year I started halfway through the year and I wanted to get December's income onto a year with a lower tax bracket.)- Discuss with that same person strategies to decrease tax liability going forward

My questions for Reddit:

1. How do I find someone to do all of this for me?  Is it like finding a lawyer or insurance agent where I just ask around/google around and then interview a few people until I find someone I feel comfortable with?  I'm guessing this has passed the point of walk down to wal-mart or a H&amp;R Block storefront and hand over my forms... I thought about doing this turbotax live thing to upgrade from my current Turbotax version, but I'm not even sure that would be sufficient...
2. Is my plan a good one where I pay my estimated taxes owed for 2020 on April 15th and then give myself 6 months to figure everything else out?
3. How much would you expect these services to cost me?

mfwt92,WuMedic,"How to Manage Funding of a 401(k) and a 403(b)

So my main job is largely self employed, and I contribute the max to a SEP-IRA (something like $56k per year).

I have a casual position (W-2 employee) with a non-profit that has a 403(b) plan.  They match 50% up to 4% (or something like that) so I put 4% in each paycheck and the get the 2% match with immediate vesting.  Since I can go for months without working for them (their busy season is usually October through March), I just put in the minimum 4% to get the match, and the amount fluctuates throughout the year.

I am now starting another casual employed position (also W-2) with a corporation that has no match for casual employees, but we can still contribute to a 401(k) with pretax deferral elections.

I am not sure how to proceed here.  I have enough income that I won't miss 19.5k from my income and I think it makes sense at my tax bracket to take advantage of the tax advantages with the 401(k) deferral (upper end of 35% marginal tax rate), but I don't wanna max out my 401(k) since it limits the amount I can contribute to my 403(b) which has a match.  For example, if I have already put $1,500 into the 403(b) in the beginning of the year, and I put $1k in per week for 18 weeks over the summer, when I'm back in the fall to my non-profit job, I will now have 2 problems--over-contribution, and I won't be able to get my 50% match.

oy0sau,WuMedic,"How to Separate From ""Financial Advisor"" without losing insurance?

TL;DR - I have a disability insurance policy with a ""financial advisor"" who I no longer enjoy working with and who seems better suited for selling used cars.  Can I leave him to find someone else without losing my policy?  Also, why does my policy list someone else's name under ""your financial representative""?

So prior to leaving medical school and again prior to leaving residency, we had exit counseling sessions about financial planning and life planning in general.  Half of it was basics that you get from a high school personal finance class, but the other half was more advanced stuff related to student loans, investments, and contingency planning.  (Retirement accounts, brokerage accounts, malpractice insurance, life insurance, disability insurance, living wills, powers of attorney, etc.)  We were all encouraged to get disability insurance (and life insurance for those of us with dependents) at a minimum and there were a list of brokers our attendings use and like as well as a list of people recently graduated residents used and liked.

Fortunately, the sessions were pretty comprehensive so it meant that when I went shopping for DI and LI, it was pretty easy to comparison shop.  There are also only 5 companies that have DI for physicians with own-occupation, same-specialty protection so it was easy to price shop.  I requested quotes from all 5 companies from a few different brokers people had good experience with in the past, and setup a meeting with the cheapest.  This is probably where I went wrong.  The cheapest only had one person who recommended him whereas the others had multiple others who had used him.

When I went to the meeting with him, he was very professional and pushed a 6th option I was as of then, unaware of.  Turns out, the company he is an affiliate of, Northwest Mutual, has it's own DI which he said was comparable to the other 5 I was looking at and would be cheaper for me.  He assured me that I could go with any of the other 5 and he would be happy to help if I didn't choose NWM's DI, but he had a lot of knowledge of this product since it was his company's own product.  I asked him to send me the plan documents to review and he had already had them prepared and handed me a packet.  After a thorough reading and some research online, it was own-occ, but not own specialty so not nearly as good as the other 5.  I declined and chose one of the other 5 companies. 

Fast forward a few months, and he was having a lot of trouble getting the policy written.  I had my health exams and such so I was just waiting on him to ""do some paperwork"" but it ended up taking a long time.  From time to time, he would offer to try to get me in with NWM's own DI policy.  I had suspected that he was just stringing me along, but someone stated they didn't think so--either way, he was going to make a commission, so why jeopardize it by trying to get me into a different product for just slightly more commission when I could just walk to a competitor.  He would also try to gauge my interest in some of the other products he wanted to set-up for me (I had also inquired about life insurance, malpractice services, retirement and brokerage accounts etc) but I was getting frustrated and I didn't want to proceed with anything else until we could get at least one thing done.

At this point, I branched out.  While it would have been nice to keep everything in one place, I was worried this guy was incompetent.  I comparison shopped for life insurance, brokerage accounts, retirement accounts, and a couple of other things.  I ended up going with one broker for LI, and went with Schwab for both retirement and brokerage accounts.  I went with yet another party for risk management/malpractice services.

At the 6 month mark, he finally had a policy for me to review.  Turns out, I had a medical condition I didn't know about which made my premiums higher than originally quoted.  I was told they would reconsider at the 2 year mark.  I don't think any of the quotes were bait-and-switch.  I have since looked at repricing the DI, and the quotes I'm getting are still similar across the board.  Other than that, it was pretty straightforward, sign on the dotted line, and off I went.  He wanted to chat more about the other products we had originally discussed, but I was tired of dealing with him so I asked him not to follow-up until it was time for renewal.

Fast forward to the one year mark, and we sit down for another chat.  I renew my DI and he has prepared a whole powerpoint presentation for life insurance, retirement accounts, risk management, and a few things we hadn't even discussed.  Once again, very professionally done, but I informed him that I had already chosen other firms for pretty much everything we talked about the first meeting and I didn't see the need for some of the extra products he was selling me.  He seemed kind of irked and flustered and started going off script.  At one point he tries to tell me that while I currently have term life insurance, I really need whole life insurance too.  This was red flag number 1.  While I don't post here often, I do read this sub occasionally, and I knew I didn't need whole life.  He then went on about how I could setup a brokerage account with them with part of my assets for more aggressive growth and how their active management consistently beats the market--red flag number 2.  I know when I'm being taken for a ride and I asked to sign the DI policy and to leave.  I also asked if he was a fiduciary and he gave a cryptic answer--they have fiduciary services, and he can be a fiduciary, once my AUM hits a certain number (I think it was 500k?).  Red flag number 3.   He seemed to turn from a friendly guy into a high pressure used car salesman in the span of about 5 minutes, not wanting to let me ""walk off the lot without any add-ons"" so to speak.  I informed him that I didn't have many days when I wasn't seeing patients and I had other meetings to get to with my other vendors so he reluctantly let me sign the policy, and I cut him a check.

That was a year ago next month.  I am not looking forward to meeting with this guy again.  I have noticed that on my renewal paperwork that just came in the mail (and looking back, the initial policy issue and first renewal) that my financial advisor's name is nowhere on it.  Instead of the guy I work with ""John Smith"" (made up names) it instead says:

Your Financial representative: Mark Brown, CFP, CLU (followed by an address not even in the same city as me, but about 1.5 hours away).

Can I just go deal with Mark and not work with John anymore without having to get a new policy and go through the health check again?  Or maybe, since they said they would reconsider at the 2 year mark, it would make sense to go shopping again?

Recently, I got a piece of mail from Capital One (whom I have a business credit card through, but not a personal one) regarding an offer.  Terms are (among other things I don't think are relevant):

* 0% intro APR on purchases and balance transfers for the first 15 months with a 15.49%-25.49% variable APR after that.  There is a 3% fee for amounts transferred for the first 15 months.
* a $200 one-time cash bonus when you spend $500 on purchases within 3 months of your account opening
* $0 annual fee
* Unlimited 1.5% cash back on every purchase, every day
* Cash Back that won't expire for the life of your account

I have to pay estimated taxes due to being self employed and they are on the order of the low 5 figure range each quarter.  I'm thinking of opening this credit card and requesting a credit limit of at least the amount due for September 15th estimated taxes.  I see these benefits:

* I get a $200 cash bonus which more than covers the fee for paying taxes with a credit card
* I get 1.5% of my taxes as cash back (so on low 5 figures, a few hundred dollars extra)
* Potentially not having to pay any interest for 15 months so until the end of 2022

I've read on PF though that I just need to make sure I pay off the whole amount before the 15 months is up or otherwise the interest accrues from day 1.  Also, it may hurt my credit utilization ratio a bit, but I currently have a mortgage with no plans on moving anytime soon and a paid off car so no plans to use credit any time soon.  My understanding is that even if my car dies tomorrow, I'm forced to move for some reason, or I need access to credit, credit utilization doesn't have a memory so I just pay off the card and my utilization ratio goes back down to zero. **Any other pitfalls I need to watch out for?**  

There's no such thing as a free lunch, so I'm just trying to see what I'm missing--why would capital one want to give me free money for 15 months?  The only thing I can think of is if they are monitoring my credit usage, they can see that with my business credit card through another bank, I routinely spend $10k-$20k per month and maybe they are trying to get a piece of that pie?

TIA for any ideas you all have!","Framing Effect, Present Bias, Affect Heuristic","The user's analysis of the credit card offer reveals several biases. The framing effect is evident as the user focuses on the benefits of the offer, such as the $200 cash bonus and 1.5% cash back, while downplaying potential drawbacks. The user is also exhibiting present bias by prioritizing short-term gains (e.g., the cash bonus and cash back) over long-term considerations (e.g., potential interest accrual and credit utilization ratio impact). Furthermore, the affect heuristic is at play as the user is making a decision based on how they feel about the offer (e.g., ""free money for 15 months"") rather than a thorough analysis of the terms and conditions.","The user tends to prioritize short-term benefits and is influenced by the framing of financial offers, often relying on intuition rather than a comprehensive analysis of the terms and conditions."

The Sunk Cost Fallacy is present as the owner is considering continuing to invest in repairs due to past expenditures ($2k in repairs the past year and $4k owed on the car), rather than evaluating the current situation objectively. Loss Aversion may also be influencing the decision, as the owner might be hesitant to accept the loss of their current car and the hassle of potentially buying a new one.

Additionally, the individual's focus on their current mental health and desire to perform at work, while ignoring the long-term implications of their debt, indicates present bias, where they are prioritizing short-term relief over long-term financial stability. The consideration of moving in with an abusive parent also implies a sunk cost fallacy, where the individual may be willing to accept a suboptimal living situation due to a sense of obligation or perceived necessity.

I quit my job in March and spent the past few months focusing on my therapy sessions. Boy, I've never been happier and more focused before. My therapist and I have worked through several reasons why I spend excessive money. It was quite eyeopening, and I'm kinda upset that I spent the past 6 years wasting away money.

* Removed my credit cards from: Paypal, Walmart, Target, Amazon, Google Play, etc.

* Sold unwanted clothing and electronics

* [Written out my total monthly debt payments](https://imgur.com/a/kE17h9m)

RENT &amp; UTILITIES | MEDICAL | FOOD | TRANSPORTATION
---------|----------|----------|----------

Dad is financially abusive, controls my mom's money and my brother's money. He wants me to move home and work for him. That's the only way he'll support me. I don't want to work for him because he's.... abusive.... I wouldn't be an employee, so he'd just pay me with room and food. That's it. If I live at home and work for him, I'd have to get a job that he wants me to have. I have no car, I drive his car. I'm not allowed to drive to my job that's 70 miles away. He wants me to get a local job, aka something maybe 4 or 5 miles away. We live in the country suburbs... so I could work at Bojangles or Food Lion or something of that nature. He expects me to pay back $1000's of dollars of money but won't tell me how much I owe him but withholds help unless I pay him whenever he asks me. I have a lot of medical expenses, like I just had a surgery last year and I also have a tumor in my head. 

Working from home is not reliable because my dad does not respect boundaries and believes that everything needs to be his way or he'll call the police. I've physically fought my dad... he's tried to push me down the stairs when I was still in high school. He will fight my mom and my brother, too.

My closest friends are either similarly abusive or they're not in the place to help anyone.

hk1qj3,xyeLz,"401k vs. IRA vs. Intelligent Portfolio vs. Brokerage

Hi all,

I am *not* financially savvy nor do I pretend to be; however, a few years ago I installed Robinhood and began using it to select individual stock investments. I made some lucky decisions and get in early on a few stocks with a little bit of money. I haven't made a ton, but I'm happy with my returns so far.

That being said, I've been doing a lot of online research lately. It seems the general consensus that the Robinhood business model is a little ""shady"" (I didn't say this myself, but I trust the community) and that there are better investment platforms out there. I've had a Vanguard and Fidelity account for the longest time and still do for some minor investments; however, I have transferred all of my Robinhood funds and a lot of my other funds to Schwab. So far, I'm loving the experience. That being said, there's an overwhelming amount of information at Schwab that prompted me to do further research, which made me wonder whether I'm doing everything correctly.

Right now, I contribute a little bit to my 401k (about $300/mo). My employer doesn't match, but they dump in a percentage of our salary at the end of the year regardless of what I put in. I've continued to add a little every month just to supplement this. However, I'm several thousand dollars off the tax bracket and don't anticipate using my 401k to lower my tax bracket anytime soon. That being said, I see conflicting theories all the time as to whether I should max out my 401k *before* investing elsewhere, or not. At the moment, I've been picking and choosing individual stocks and have been doing quite well (crossing my fingers for the future). I also began investing IRAs (Roth vs. traditional). Recently, I signed my wife and myself up for an Intelligent Portfolio at Schwab with the intention that we will both contribute regularly to this in an effort to grow our ""future together fund"", something like $400-600 per month between the two of us. Since we've been married, she's never liked the fact that we don't have a joint account, so I thought this would be a great way to consolidate *some* of our funds while growing them simultaneously.

That being said, I'm still really torn where to go personally. Should I be contributing a lot more to my 401k? Should I open an IRA and contribute here instead? Why or why not? Or should I continue to invest in individual stocks within my brokerage? I recently sold most of my Vanguard ETFs because the returns on the stocks were just too appetizing (and continue to pay off, but this may come crashing down depending on what happens with COVID). I love the thought of investing heavily and taking a ton of risk for big gains. I actually did a lot of crypto investing during the boom a few years ago - this unfortunately did not end well for me, but that's how you learn.

In any case, I'm just looking for some practical advise from those out there who have maybe been through this before. I'm young-ish (32), I have a somewhat cheap home, a wife and no children, and am willing to live below my means for big gains. But I also realize I'm not 22 and will likely have a family and aspirations to move into a bigger house in the next 3-5 years.

Hi all,

I purchased some sheets from a seemingly reputable company about 6 weeks ago. In my initial email explanation to them of what I was looking for, I have in writing that I explicitly asked for ""flat sheets that I could use as my fitted sheet"" and that ""the manufacturer explained this as ordering fitted sheets without the elastic"". When I spoke on the phone with the vendor, they informed me that they knew what I was talking about. We discussed some technical details, and I informed them that it was odd that they were asking for a ""depth"" since all I wanted was a flat sheet. Since this was on the phone, it is obviously not available, but it sounds like there was a misunderstanding. The entire order was almost $700.

I recently received my first delivery and the sheets were incorrect. They contained an elastic, so the company is allowing me to ship back the sheets (obviously) for a full refund.

However, when I received the second delivery, it wasn't what I had intended. I received the sheets but they are essentially a fitted sheet without an elastic. I realize that this is what pretty much the manufacturer provided me, which is what I had informed the vendor, but it is also *not* what I had asked for. I had explicitly asked for a *flat* sheet to act as a fitted sheet. This was my first time ordering sheets, and when I spoke with the vendor on the phone I thought this was relatively clear. I literally can't use the sheets since, because they're fitted, they're made specifically for a certain size bed (they have contours around the outside that are too large for my mattress). I'm telling you, any other vendor would have recognized this since I had gone back and forth several times with them changing the size. I really just think this salesperson didn't know what they were doing.

In any case, the vendor is refusing to refund the order because the manufacturer won't take it back. They are, however, offering to sell me a new set of sheets at wholesale price. I estimate wholesale price will probably be between $300 and $400. In my opinion, this is ridiculous. I wouldn't mind so much if I could actually use the sheets I have sitting on my shelf now, but I can't. What are my options here? Should I just order the sheets at wholesale price or should I dispute the charge? Am I being petty or do I actually have legitimate cause to dispute the charge and win? I realize it's nice of the vendor to offer the sheets at wholesale price, but I feel like if anything, half the blame is on them.

I opened an empty HSA with Fidelity with the intention to transfer on an annual basis, but it seems like there's no fee to initiate a partial transfer every month so long as I leave the minimum in the Health Equity account ($25) to keep it open.

w1bs0z,xyeLz,"Considering rolling over 401k to IRA for one-time HSA transfer but don't want to jeopardize backdoor Roth IRA?

This is a pretty niche situation but I'm hoping someone here more savvy than me can help.

I have a 401k from a former employer that I rolled over to my current employer. According to my 401k servicer, I can only rollover the amount that was transferred, not anything that I've contributed since being at this employer. Both of these amounts are in the 5 figures.

The reason I would like to roll this over is so that I can perform a one-time transfer of some of these IRA funds into our HSA. My ultimate goal was to never touch the HSA and treat it like a retirement account, and then withdraw from it EITHER once I reached an appropriate age *or* if needed for medical expenses. We're also expecting our first child in September and our medical bills for this year have already met our deductible and then some, so at least having the option to use this for medical expenses in a crunch would be beneficial rather than having it sit in an IRA (or currently a 401k). IN BOTH CASES I would plan to withdraw the money tax free using receipts from medical bills saved over the years.

A few issues I have with this approach:

1. Right now, my employer contributes half of the max to my HSA (I contribute the remaining half) so if I decided to perform a one-time lifetime transfer, I would only want to contribute half of what the max is (otherwise the remaining half would be taxed), which seems like I could miss out on the possibility to contribute even more at some other point, for example if I changed employers and they didn't contribute to the HSA.
2. I would need to wait until the end of the year since I have been contributing the max YTD for the tax advantaged savings.
3. If I roll over my eligible 401k into an IRA, I will be rolling over more than the one-year maximum for the HSA. This means I will have money sitting in my IRA. I do currently have a Roth IRA and I have never attempted a backdoor Roth, but I liked having this as an option; however, I don't know what the complications might look like given the pro-rata rule if I proceed with this approach?","Loss Aversion, Status Quo Bias, Regret Aversion","The individual is hesitant to roll over their 401k to an IRA due to concerns about jeopardizing their backdoor Roth IRA option, indicating a Status Quo Bias, as they are reluctant to change their current situation.

* If my child becomes a screwup in life (God forbid), a UTMA would still provide him all of this investment (and I'm not the type of Dad to go about withdrawing our investments; the money in here is his no matter what and that's how we will approach this).
* A youth account would be something later on in life.
* A joint account seems to make the most sense since it gives us the most control, but what am I missing here? Are there tax-advantages I'm missing out on by doing a joint account over a UTMA/UGMA? What about when it comes to college? Could this negatively impact us somehow?

I'm maxing out my HSA and 401(k) thanks to some of the great suggestions on this subreddit, and now I'm looking into setting up a backdoor Roth IRA since my income exceeds the limits to contribute normally. My wife and I (filing separately) recently had a child and it seems the backdoor Roth is the more advantageous method of maximizing savings rather than contributing to a 529 (we live in Massachusetts).

3. Rollover this new traditional IRA immediately into my existing Roth IRA.

There are no issues with using an existing Roth IRA for the rollover, correct? I don't need to create a brand new Roth IRA account for the rollover?
