Am I doing this right.... or should I adjust plan? 

Thinking I'll be retiring in less than 10 years, so here is what I am up to and looking for critiques,  comments, suggestions, opinions, and other options. 

Wife works... but for this scenario, her income not included... mostly going to pay out kids college costs. 

we refi'ed house @ 118k fir 20 years at 2.99% last summer. present balance is 97k. I make the monthly payment.

I send 1k/week to mortgage principal.
I send appx. 750/week to Roth IRA. (might be more-never less)
I send appx. 500/week to brokerage account.(might be more-never less)

When Roth IRA gets maxed out in a couple of weeks...that money will be sent to mortgage principal...maybe dump some of it in brokerage account if I feel like I need to buy something. 

I'd like to have 100k in deposits to Roth IRA by the time I retire. (or as close too 100k as possible).
I'd like to have 100k+ in deposits to brokerage account by the time I retire.
I'd like to have the house paid off by next year.
There is no rhyme or reason to these numbers - I had a vision while showering one day ...which commenced with the refi the next day.

I have a retirement plan through work, the Roth is just extra.

No car loans. 
No CC balances outstanding. 
...just the usual groceries,  cell phone, utilities,  auto insurance, and that sort of recurring expenses. There really is no entertainment budget as covid is a real buzz kill.


This is not meant to be some sort of brag sheet.
I have no financial schooling or financual advisor. 
I'm pretty clueless and would just want to the right thing for my family and retirement.

Questions or comments?","Anchoring, Affect Heuristic, Present Bias","The statement reveals several biases in the individual's financial decision-making process. The target amounts of $100k for both the Roth IRA and brokerage account, as well as paying off the house by next year, seem arbitrary and may be influenced by Anchoring, where the individual is fixating on specific numbers without a clear rationale. The decision to allocate funds to these goals also appears to be driven by the Affect Heuristic, where the individual's emotional response to a ""vision"" in the shower led to immediate action, such as refinancing the house. Furthermore, the individual's prioritization of short-term goals, such as paying off the house and maxing out the Roth IRA, over potentially more long-term or diversified investment strategies, may indicate Present Bias, where the individual is prioritizing immediate gratification over future benefits.","The individual exhibits a tendency to make impulsive financial decisions based on emotional responses and arbitrary targets, rather than a well-reasoned, long-term investment strategy.

While it's commendable that the individual is taking proactive steps towards retirement planning and debt repayment, their approach appears to be driven more by intuition and emotional responses rather than a thorough analysis of their financial situation and goals.

My dad is 65, still working a 100k pa 9 to 5 but planning to retire soon.

His only income post retirement will be SS.

My father is 66, still working but not investing-savvy, and I finally started investing for him post-lockdown (better late than never) in a simple 2-fund portfolio that we wouldnâ€™t need to look at too often considering a broad time horizon: 60% VT and 40% BNDW.

Out of the $164k Iâ€™ve invested over the past year or two in the above portfolio, he currently stands at $143k (down approx. $21k or 13% till date) which now stands as follows:

VT: $89k


BNDW: $54k

(Ratio is 62:38, havenâ€™t re-balanced in a while.. I actually find this kind of weird because stocks have dropped more than bonds so the ratio should have been tilted towards bonds?! But anyway, thatâ€™s not the main point of the post.)

He also has ~$64k cash in his savings a/c that I MISTAKENLY didnâ€™t factor into the above ratio when I first started investing, so at present, his VT:(BNDW+cash) is 43:57, way off from my target! 

I am now trying to correct it so VT:(BNDW+cash) is 60:40 because I guess thatâ€™s the correct way and cash must be included in the 40%?

Hereâ€™s my proposed plan for the $64k savings account balance and needed advice:

1) Buy $35k more of VT so total VT would be $124k

2) Buy $20k of i-bonds ($10k each under his and his wifeâ€™s name) 

3) Leave $9k cash in savings account 

After this, his ratios would finally be corrected and look like:

1) VT:  $124k


2) BNDW + i-bonds + cash = $83k

VT:(all bonds+cash) = 60:40

Does this look okay to you guys? 

P.S. Heâ€™s also still working so the savings cash balance would go up ~$3k every month so itâ€™s not like he would have only $9k cash left with him.

I got divorced last year and have straight 50/50 custody (week on/week off) of our twin 15 year-old boys with my ex-wife.  I'm trying to do my own taxes for the first time with FreeTaxUSA and see what a big difference it's going to make with my return depending upon who gets to claim them as dependents.  I think I know the answer, but here's how it reads (not sure what parts of this are relevant, so I'll simply post the entire text):


**Claiming children as dependents on tax forms:   the parties have the right to claim the children on their tax forms as follows: every year (ex-wife) has the right to claim (child one) and (child two).  For tax years where a non-custodial parent has the right to claim the children, the parents must cooperate to fill out and submit IRS form 8332 in a timely manner.**

**The parents are designated joint custodians of the children solely for the purposes of state and federal statues which require designation or determination of custody.  If only one parent can be named custodian, it shall be the mother in even-numbered years and the father in odd-numbered years.  This designation shall not change the parenting rights and responsibilities described in this plan.  Washington state law generally refers to parenting time and decision-making rather than custody.  However, some state and federal laws require that one person be named the custodian.  The custodian is the person with whom the children are scheduled to reside the majority of the time.**

My background:

I'm a 52 year-old divorced man with a history of six figure annual compensation.  I was a Covid layoff casualty six months ago and just accepted a new six figure job that I'll start later this month.  Because of my layoff and the uncertainty of the job market, I've kept over $30k in a high yield savings account and haven't had to tap into much of it (collecting unemployment and living frugally) and still have about $30k of it left.  As a result of my new job I feel comfortable shifting $20k of this into investment.  Here are my specs:

*I own a $1.4 million home with about $300k remaining on my mortgage.

*My expenses (including $1,300/month home mortgage) are approximately $3k/month.

*I have no other debt (car fully owned, credit cards all current).

*My investments are with Schwab and I have $127k in a Rollover IRA Schwab Target 2030 Index Fund (SWYEX) along with a $10k CD that matures in 2022.  I have $14k within my Roth Contributory IRA in a Schwab Intelligent Portfolio. 

*I maxed out my Roth IRA for both 2019 and 2020 at $7k each.

*I foresee no other significant expenses for the foreseeable future but have 16 year-old twin boys that will be off to college in two years that I will have to help fund.

*I'm hoping to retire in my mid-60s and realize that I'll probably have to downsize my home when I reach retirement age to be able to achieve this.

*I have limited personal finance acumen (my ex used to manage all our money and I've visited this sub previously for wonderful advice).

Hi allâ€¦Iâ€™m sure this is a worn-out subject for most of you.  Please understand that, while Iâ€™ve done extensive research on this sub and outside of it, Iâ€™m always going to seek out more confirmation because this is one of the two or three most important purchases of my lifetime.

Iâ€™m in a comparatively low-cost-of-living area (but itâ€™s growing as rapidly as any place in America; Knoxville area).  Iâ€™m looking at making a purchase in spring to early summer of next year.  I have $30k in a discretionary portfolio.  I have $25k in savings/checking.  My non-housing costs total $800-$1k/mo.  My after tax/retirement take-home is about $2900/mo.  Iâ€™m currently saving about $1k/mo.

Iâ€™m looking at a purchase in the $140k-$200k range, depending on how aggressive I choose to get.  I can probably cut discretionary spending by as much as $150/mo.  Iâ€™m drawn towards the idea of a 20% down payment to avoid PMI.  If we assume my $30k portfolio is liquid, to be used on costsâ€¦and that my $25k in bank accounts will grow to $30k by the time this comes yo fruition, how risky is a purchase in the range Iâ€™m considering?

If I want to keep an emergency fund of ~$9k, expect closing costs of $5k, and immediate expenses of $5k (Iâ€™d likely be buying a home built between 1940 and 1970), that would leave me with with roughly $40k to use on a down payment.","Confirmation Bias, Anchoring, Status Quo Bias","The individual exhibits Confirmation Bias as they mention seeking ""more confirmation"" on the subject, indicating a tendency to seek out information that supports their existing views.

szyrvh,TrustyBagOfPlaylists,"Some Micro information that I learned today in a conversation with a mortgage lender (student loans, time lines, etc).

Iâ€™m just putting this out there in case others have similarly mistaken ideas of how things will work for you.  As someone whoâ€™s been paying in his student loans for 10+ years and still has &gt;$100k to pay, Iâ€™ve done a fair amount of research as to what I can possibly do to own a home.  But, that research didnâ€™t reveal some things to me.  Hopefully it helps.

My biggest misconception is that my debt to income ratio would impact my interest rate.  Iâ€™d waited longer than necessary to start this process because of it.  According to the two lenders Iâ€™ve spoken to, DTI has much more to do with whether you qualify for a mortgage at allâ€¦and which programs you might qualify for.  It has a much smaller effect on interest rates.  Even though their current, non-ideal formula (.5% of total debt paid monthly) is much more than I would actually pay on ibr (by about $500/mo), I was still given a 4.25% estimateâ€¦which is competitive.

Secondly, whatever rates youâ€™ve researched are subject to change until you â€˜lock inâ€™ your rate, which happens after youâ€™re ready or have made an offer on a property, which can happen 2-5 months, or more, after youâ€™ve been pre-approved for your mortgage loan.  That difference in that amount of time can be staggering.

Step 1) get pre approved by having your credit pulled and giving basic info.  Step 2) search for and find a house.  Step 3) get real numbers and lock in a rate.  Step 4) submit your offer.  At some point in there, Iâ€™m sure the inspection happens.  I imagine between step 3 and 4â€¦but unsure.  Also can speak to subsequent steps yet.

Iâ€™m looking at a houses in my area for purchase.  Inventory is incredibly low.  But Iâ€™m 1) tired of my rent not going towards anything salvageable and 2) tired of being a man in his mid-late 30â€™s, living with roommates.

I live in a townhouse with 2 people I trust and like (even though Iâ€™d rather separate), paying $~580/mo for rent/utilities (and believe I can lock in that rent for the next ~15 months, although I believe it could go up considerably after that).  I have $24k immediately available and another $25k in a portfolio that I can divest from if needed.

Thereâ€™s a 3BR/2BA house that I like at $185k asking.  It was built in 1900 but was newly renovated in the last year â€” everything VISIBLE is new (roof, siding, flooring, cabinets, appliances, etc).  Iâ€™ll find out more about plumbing/foundation/electrical soon.

The cost for mortgage/tax/homeowners/PMI would be ~$1025-$1050/mo with a 10% down payment ($18500).  My other monthly (non-housing) costs amount to $800-$825.  If I set aside $200/mo for water/electric (1240 sq feet) and $325/mo for housing maintenance costs, my take home of $2800/mo leaves me with roughly $5k/yr of savings.

I expect an increase of pay in the next year (although I could, of course, be wrong) of roughly 10-15%.  I have an additional $30k in retirement accounts as well.


1) am I in a safe position, in your opinion, to buy this home.

2) do you think itâ€™s preferable to ride out the rental with my two roommates (even given my need for change from that dynamic) for at least another year to solidify my financial position, where I could save another $~15k-$18k?

Thank you to anyone who take the time to read through that mess and consider it thoughtfully.","Loss Aversion, Present Bias, Status Quo Bias","The individual in the statement appears to be influenced by Loss Aversion, as they express a strong desire to stop paying rent that doesn't contribute to anything salvageable, implying a fear of missing out on building equity. Additionally, Present Bias is evident as they prioritize short-term changes in their living situation, such as moving out of a shared space and becoming a homeowner, over potentially more prudent long-term financial planning. Status Quo Bias also seems to be at play as the individual is inclined to stick with their current rental situation, but only because it's familiar, and is hesitant to consider maintaining the status quo for another year to solidify their financial position.","The individual tends to prioritize short-term emotional and lifestyle changes over long-term financial prudence, while also being influenced by a fear of loss and a preference for the familiar."
tjtind,TrustyBagOfPlaylists,"The most difficult part is seeing others, with less, doing more.

This subreddit has really been a savior for me.  I have learned that it might be a little too strict.  However, if nothing else, it forces you to listen to the worst-case or argue your take.

Due to advice received here and confronting the realities of my current/possible circumstances, I recently opted out of buying a home.  I only currently spend ~21% of my take home on rent and utilities.  While arguing for buying a home, I realized that Iâ€™d be spending 35.5% on mortgage/tax/insurance.  44% if I include utilities/internet.  53% if I set aside a reasonable amount for maintenance.  While I think that math doesnâ€™t fairly compare how much I can invest with free money versus how much Iâ€™m investing into equity, itâ€™s still a stark realization.


But, itâ€™s tough seeing people who are doing things less responsibly getting things youâ€™re too cautious to opt into.  Of course you tell yourself that some of them will either be forced out of their situation or even lose everything.  But some will pull it off.  And Iâ€™m jealous of them.

Iâ€™ll continue to rentâ€¦and share a place with two roommates.  Iâ€™ll save money for another year â€” maybe even more.  I just hope that I donâ€™t regret these decisions when I finally spend the capital Iâ€™ve been working towards for so long.

EDIT:  sorry I bailed on this, everyone.  Iâ€™ll re-visit after work.  Iâ€™m glad itâ€™s a topic thatâ€™s spurring on some discussion, though.","Loss Aversion, Regret Aversion, Affect Heuristic","The statement reveals several biases. The writer's concern about seeing others ""doing more"" with less and feeling jealous suggests that they are influenced by Loss Aversion, as they are worried about missing out on potential benefits of buying a home. Additionally, the writer's decision to continue renting and saving money for another year, despite feeling uncertain about their choices, indicates Regret Aversion, as they are trying to avoid potential regret. The writer's emotional response to others' success and their own caution also suggests the Affect Heuristic, where they are making decisions based on how they feel about the situation rather than a thorough analysis.","The user exhibits a tendency to make cautious financial decisions influenced by emotions, a fear of missing out, and a desire to avoid regret."
