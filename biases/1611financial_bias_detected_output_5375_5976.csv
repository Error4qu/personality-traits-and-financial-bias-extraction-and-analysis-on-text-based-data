I know this is a hard question but I think its probably easier to answer compared to when will the next correction or crash be.

Looks like most total market index funds have given 14-16% since 2010 annually. Its a pretty sweet number. 2000-2009 sucked and even when we average the 2010's with the 2000's you end up with a subpar return rate compared to the historic return rate of the sp500 (9%).

Now given past performance does not indicate anything about future performance I see both sides of the coin

Pros:

Hyperinflation/money being pumped, low bond rates (and expected to be low until 2023 - and still continue)- forcing people to not only borrow money but funnel their funds mostly into stocks. We have a growing population (and economy). Our tech sector (may) be overvalued but still is dominant. And other world economies seem to be shrinking as well as population

Cons/Worries:

Worried about the biden tax hikes. Also worried about if inflation will catch up to us in the next decade. obviously any black swan events. Tech sector taking a hit and a rotation into another sector.

102bv77,snorkleface,"How to afford child care costs

Long-time enjoyer of the PF sub, I know the basics. My wife and I do *fairly* well for our age/area.

We already spend extremely minimally on food, I meal prep and eat for less than $10/day most days (for health reasons more than money, but its a nice benefit).

I was just quoted a child care cost that equates to a second house payment every month. I can tell you this, definitely don't have that much left over each month. This is for only 1 kid, we plan on two eventually.

How do people do this? Do you sacrifice your retirement (fully or partially) to fund child care? Does everyone go through a career change prior to having a kid so they can make more money? And I'm supposed to be starting 529's for these suckers at the same time too...?

ej2kww,snorkleface,"Some quick advice on spending and a simple tool to help

 

The only way you can cut down your spending is if you *know* what you are spending you money on. Many of us think that we know, but the reality is often very different.

I saw online someone had posted a joke: what if at the end of the year your credit cards gave you a recap of your spending similar to how Spotify does it with your music? ""200 trips to Taco bell"" or ""You spent $150 this year on cheese alone"", etc. That would be a funny yet interesting tool.

Well, they do! You can download your transactions from your credit cards any time you want. A quick pivot chart in excel will tell you more about your spending than you could ever guess or track on your own.

My girlfriend and I would eat out a lot but would always choose the ""cheap"" options ($15-25 for dinner for both of us for example). Little did we know was how fast this adds up up. We were spending close to $800 / month on restaurants! No wonder we couldn't save any money.

(Not to mention, we *thought* we were spending $15-25/meal... average was really more like $30-35. Don't forget to account for tips, and the once-in-a-while $50-60 meals that are twice as much as a normal night).

We stopped eating out as much, started grocery shopping, and realized how much cheaper it could really be. All while still eating really good food, i'm not saying you have to convert to Ramen noodles every day. Neither of us are chefs by any means but google makes it very easy to find simple and cheap meals for one or two.

I'm sharing this info because it helped me cut back my spending immensely. When you can actually see the numbers...it changes how you think about everything.

What's the best way to calculate how much I'll *spend* in retirement? 

Any retirement planner/calculator will ask how much you plan on spending in retirement. How can that possibly be calculated? Sure, I might want to make the same amount yearly as I do now. Won't inflation make that number irrelevant? Lets say I'm 30 years old, retiring in \~35 years. If I make $100k now, it might only be worth $40k (relatively speaking) by the time I hit retirement. 

Then of course there's so many other personal factors to consider. If I stay in the same house I'll likely have my mortgage paid off by then. But if I move when I'm 50 (kids are moved out, time to downsize) I might have another 15 years of a mortgage to pay (with whatever property taxes will be like then).

Looking for someone to tell me I'm not (or am!) crazy for considering taking out a personal loan to partially finish my basement.

Long story short, I'm DIY partially finishing my basement. I do realize I'm picking the worst possible time in the past 30 years to be buying a bunch of materials and hiring out labor, but it is what it is. I need to hire out electrical and plumbing which came out to be way more expensive that I originally planned. Total for both jobs is $15k. 

Citi is offering me $15k, 60months , 10.99% interest. Monthly payment is roughly $325/m.

Unfortunately, my home still has PMI (hoping to get rid of in August of this year) so I believe HELOCs are out of the equation. I also refinanced my house almost 2 years ago and got a 3% rate, so definitely not looking to refi again with rates being double that now. 

Quick budget rundown, my wife and I bring in about $8,400/m after taxes and retirement. We have roughly $4,000 in monthly bills (mortgage, utilities, student loans, car payments, etc.) which does not include our food and other discretionary spending. 

From a budget perspective, I think we can easily afford an extra 300 bucks a month.

I am trying to determine how affordable a new vehicle that I am considering is, or, another way, how detrimental to my finances is this new vehicle? It has been a long time since I have personally bought a new vehicle for my use. I am aware of market conditions currently and unwilling to pay any mark ups or addendums for a new vehicle. More on that towards the bottom. 

I want to layout a round numbers idea of our situation; married 36M/37F; one child. 

Household income (husband and wife): $130,000 - $164,000 (part of my compensation is variable commission). For 2022 our gross was about $148K household; need to see where December shakes out at but close enough. 

Total of all accounts including retirement, taxable brokerage, and cash: $1.3m

Portion of that total that is Cash: $200K

We max out our 401K's and Roth IRA's each year, $750 per week into taxable brokerage investments

Mortgage: $245K balance at 2.625%.  PITI is $2000 month (insurance is insane)

Monthly Household Bills (Water, Electric, Lawn service, cable/internet, pest control) $400

Grocery: $500 month

Monthly HOA: $160

Child UTMA, 529, Prepaid College Plan: $300

Car payment wife car:  $415 month.  Approx $13,000 remaining. Rate is 2.99%.  Car has wholesale value of 21k, so not upside down or any rush to pay off or pay faster. 

Insurances (3 Cars, Umbrella Policy) Approx $600 month (we pay in full for a discount, but dividing the total by 12 to come up with a monthly average)

Credit cards: No revolving debt 

No other loans or financial obligations. 

Looking at a Honda CRV Hybrid or Toyota Rav4 Hybrid. Both come to approx $35K. I have found dealerships willing to reserve for me those models at MSRP + tax/tag/etc. 

I would plan to finance for 60 months, and it seems like current rates are hovering around 7%, which has me concerned. 

I would be willing to finance for 48 months if there is a manufacturer backed rate in the 2.9-4.9 range, as there sometimes is offered. I will also check my credit union for rates. 

However, \*for discussion and comparison purposes, in order to work with round numbers\* if we assume 35K price + tax and 7% rate, the Total of Payments is approximately 42K; and it is $700 month for 60 months.  So I'd like to use that $700 month number. 

&amp;#x200B;

I also want to add that I am reimbursed mileage driven for work. This varies but we can say an average of 200 miles per week; or a bit over $120 reimbursed per week.  For a Hybrid Honda or Toyota that leaves approx $100 a week after covering fuel to cover costs/maintenance/depreciation.  Call it $400 a month that I can put towards the vehicle costs.  

\*I would sell the 2006 Honda, not be adding a 4th car to insurance. 

Where does this fit in as far as affordability. Any good rules of thumb to go by? Between money we have, obligations/expenses we have, reimbursables, and the estimated finance scenario how does it all look to the other personalfinance forum members? 

I am open to ideas and suggestions. I am here seeking other perspectives. I respectfully ask that this thread not be derailed or brigaded.

Hi all,

So I  did two dumb things. During my last call (before the offer letter), I said I was happy with the salary and I would like to accept the offer. This morning, in an email I got from my soon-to-be boss, I said I would send over the offer letter signed this afternoon. Got the offer yesterday and had till Dec 1st. Ahh...why did I do that.

This position is remote and I am lucky that I will be able to live with my parents for a few months. I would like to move to Boston where the HQ for this org is but idk if 45,000 is sufficient for that. 

Is it too late to negotiate? How would I even do it? It's for a Global Health nonprofit. If I don't negotiate now, will I be able to a year after when I have more valid reasons for a salary raise as a result of my work?

Do you also think they will look down upon me for not negotiating? My manager seems really sweet and seems to care deeply about the work experience so part of me is wondering if she wants me to negoatiate.

Hi all,

I am a recent graduate and just started this job on monday. I am single and live in CA, and am a dependent under my parents. So my work uses this system called Trinet for onboarding and providing tax information. The last time I was onboarded it was in person and I remember I had to choose between putting 0 and 1 and have no idea if that was related to state taxes or federal, but it was all done on paper. 

I think on Trinet, you are able to put your withholding info and so for CA my withholding was 0, and then for some reason, my federal said N/A. I think I may have had the chance to edit it intially but I accidentally didn't.  If I go back to edit it makes me fill out a W4 form but it seems like it's a W4 that ""changes"" my witholding. I have no idea what is going on and am so confused.

On Trinet it basically is a chart that looks like this

Type                                                       Tax Filing Status                                Witholding

|:-|:-|:-|
|CA State|Single, or Married w...|0|

All I know is that I would like to **have the maximum amount of tax taken out now so I or my parent don't have to pay later.** I don't mind receiving a lump sum later. Hence why I have always put zero in the past.

I probabaly applied to around 120 jobs and only heard back from 2.

So I am a recent grad who started working for a nonprofit. My boss and org have been so sweet and understanding. But I can't help but feel so incompetent and just so out of place. I have been making so many careless mistakes digitally, it is so embarrassing.  I am on an annual salary and my signed hours are from 7-3 pm. I get a 30 minute paid lunch. My job is remote.

What I have been doing for the past two months since I started was logging my hours as:

7-12:00 PM Work

12-12:30 PM Meal

12:30-3:00 PM Work

My boss reached out to me today telling me that we have paid lunch and that I should use it and I was confused cause I always clock in my lunch and she approves them. She then told me she only sees my hours logged as 7-3:00 PM/8 hours. I then told her how I logged time and I haven't heard back. I know she saw my message.

I am FREAKING out. Was I supposed to be working 8 hours a day and then get a 30-minute lunch break, is that lunch break not included in the 8 hours? I am literally gonna start crying, this new job and professionalism have been so stressful. I wish I can talk to my parents about this but they both work minimum wage jobs on the hour and don't get paid lunch. I am so scared. Idk if it's cause I am the first in my family to work a professional job, but I feel like this transition has been so much harder for me than my peers. I don't know if I can do it.

During onboarding, I accidentally selected N/A when filling out the federal allowance portion of the form. It was not directly a W4 form but a form on a portal my workplace used to get tax info.

Hi all,

Backstory: I used this QR code generator for a nonprofit I volunteered for but the head wanted me to get a subscription so they could use an expired QR code I made for a fundraiser.  I had this bad gut feeling about saying yes to getting the subscription from this website (which I expressed) but she venmo'd me the cost prior. She sounded super urgent and she was on her way to an event where she needed to have the QR code so I said ""screw it...what are the odds"" and put in my credit info. As soon as I processed the payment, I got a fraud text alert from BoA (my bank) asking if I made the purchase. It was weird cause the text alert showed two payments of $119. I was only supposed to pay $9.99. So immediately I responded 'no' this was not my purchase and then got a notification saying my BoA CC was deactivated. I logged back on to the BoA app and filed these claims as fraudulent. And then the BoA app said they are issuing me a new card in 5-7 business days and giving me a new account number. I logged back on and saw the last four digits of my new account number and my own balance prior to this purchase, travel rewards points are still there.

I think for the most part this new card/account should solve the situation and protect me from credit card theft, but are there any other added steps I should do for security? 

Also, will this hurt my credit score? I have always been good at paying my cc bills on time and in general, am very cautious with my finances and identity (I just let the pressure get to me this time). I do plan on speaking with a BoA advisor in person tomorrow.

Hi all, so in general I am very cautious about how I pay for things, especially online due to scams etc. I am a recently admitted grad student at a school in DC and am looking to spend the summer there for about two months before I commit. I found a sublet from a fellow student on the university's housing FB group.

Bonds fall less in down turns but they also don't make as many gains in good years and with recoveries as stocks. I am not referring to TIPS or series I bonds, but corporate bonds.

So my 401k and other retirement accounts with fidelity have a brokerage link option.

Am I silly not to transfer all the standard 401k funds I am in (small, mid and large cap, international) to this brokerage account in the retirement account and put the money into equivalent index funds? The 401k fees aren't huge, but they are still somewhere between 0.1% to 0.45%, AFAIK.

I am not concerned that I will start investing in individual stocks or crypto with my retirement fund. Self control is my middle name.

Also, is there any concern for making this swap right now during the down times?

Hello all,
I'm going to take a crack at this tax loss harvesting thing. I have a few questions and was wondering if you all can help.

1. What is another etf that I can replace VOO without wash sale rule taking effect?

2. What is another ETF that I can place VTI without the wash sale rule taking effect?

3. Does the 3k deduction from earned income from tax loss harvesting apply to the household or to individuals. For example could I take 3k and my wife take 3k? We file jointly.  I assume she needs her own brokerage account to do this if this is allowed.

4. Can I deduct 3k from earned income for future years from the losses this year?

5. Is there a type of investment that pays out yearly that can be deducted beyond the 3k from loss harvesting? For example something like a dividend or a REIT payout that would count as long term capital gains and not short term capital gains, since short term capital gains are treated as earned income in relation to the 3k max deduction per year.

I am someone who does very well with budgeting/financing/money management. Within the last year I got a credit card for the sake of having another account outside of checking/savings and to take advantage of the cash back deals (if you manage a CC well and never keep debt then itâ€™s â€œfreeâ€ money, right?).

I spend Iâ€™d say roughly $700 a month through my CC which covers food, gas, online purchases, etc. anything that doesnâ€™t hit me with a fee for using my card (like rent). Of that maybe 2-300 is food. 

I recently got a mail offer from a different bank I have student loans through that is 10% back on groceries/food until May 2021, and 1.8% back on everything else indefinitely. It has no startup or monthly fee etc, itâ€™s clean. In addition I see offers all the time for â€œwith this card spend $500 in your first three months and get $200 cash backâ€ type-thing.

Probably a stupid question... but Iâ€™m wondering about the possible negatives or things Iâ€™m overlooking in my situation. 

Basically, I for whatever reason took out private student loans by the semester (till my final year) so I in total had 7 loans. Iâ€™ve been aggressively paying them off but still have 4 left totaling around 20k at ~6.7% interest. I also have 21k in public which is in forbearance but appears to be at 2.75% when it resumes? My minimum payment is currently $260 on just the private but Iâ€™ve budgeted to be able to throw about $1,000 at it per month, or 4x the payment and hopefully get it done by end of 2022 at the latest.  

Iâ€™ve been checking out refinancing the private loans and have been quoted 3.87% for a 5-year loan with minimum payments being around $370. Mathematically it obviously makes sense NOT to include the public in this refinance and that I can well afford the monthly payments (will still be doing 2.5-3x min payments). Is there anything that I may be overlooking here? It might sound stupid but is it worth refinancing for a *relatively* small debt that will be paid off very quickly?

-We are maxing out two 401ks each month 

-We have about 70k total in retirement (across all accounts) 

Now all of that sounds like we are in an okay financial situation and maybe in paranoid but hear me outâ€¦

If we buy a house on a 30 year loan, our mortgage would around $800-900 a month. This obviously doesnâ€™t include utilities, taxes, repairs, etc. 

We currently put $1000 a month from our paychecks into retirement accounts. 

We currently put $1,000 a month from our paychecks in savings (we put an additional $2,000 a month from our side business, but we likely wonâ€™t keep that up for too much longer so I donâ€™t want to count that).

So doing the math on buying a houseâ€¦take our $400 rent currently and probably triple it for our housing costs so thatâ€™s $1,200 a month.

We are saving $1,000 a month so now that savings will go toward our mortgage and we would have $200 left over (400 + 1,000 - 1,200 = 200) 

So that means we would be saving $200 a month. Now what happens when we want to buy a car? I feel like we are in a better financial situation to not just buy a beater, but I donâ€™t see where the rest of the money comes from in the budget. 

Yes we have an emergency fund and we have a nice pot of savings, but I donâ€™t see how a house and a car payment fits into our day to day budget.

With my current housing plan, I aim to have my mortgage paid off by then, so my net expenses should be drastically lower by that age.

However, if you're not going to live much longer beyond 70, then taking the benefit earlier is always better. And the same conundrum follows.

first job that offers 401k, while configuring the settings it came out these 2 questions and I guessed and finished the application. now a month it would be $1080. half in roth half 401k

**PERSONAL DETAILS**

My age: 33 â€“ Health and Safety Manager (13 years)

Wife Age: 27 â€“ Family Law Attorney (3 years)

Monthly Expenses: \~4k (bare minimum is closer to 3k).

I realize I have not saved as much as I should have, I didnâ€™t really start focusing saving until I was \~27yrs old - after my first marriage.

We also arenâ€™t as frugal as we could be.

Below I have outlined all of our financial info as well as my investment questions.

My income: 100k

Wife Income: 75k

**Total Income**: 175k

&amp;#x200B;

**FUNDS**

**Total funds**: 55k

**RETIREMENT**

401K: 80k (Mine)

Simple IRA: 25k (Hers)

My Roth IRA (Just opened): 6k

Her Roth IRA (Just Opened): 6k

Previously we made over the income limit and could not open a Roth IRA.

**Total Retirement**: 117k

&amp;#x200B;

**DEBT**

**Debt**: Vehicles 20k (0% APR) â€“ No other debt

&amp;#x200B;

**HOUSING**

Renting Apartment: We currently rent for $1500 a month in Katy TX. I have owned homes in the past, however I move around for work on average every 3-5 years, and with the high property taxes, high market prices, and historical flooding in Houston, I have opted to not buy a house at this time. I am hoping to find something within in the next year or two (maybe an auction sale?).

&amp;#x200B;

**Investment Question**: I am not sure what to do next. I have very little education in investing or retirement savings in general. The 50k in our savings needs to be moved into a high yield saving account (I was thinking Ally Bank), however 50k is still overkill for an emergency fund and we are still ending up with a net couple thousand dollars each month. My father-in law is also paying back a loan we gave him of 20k, which will be coming in over the next 6 months.

&amp;#x200B;

Ultimately, this money needs to be invested into something else, and I really donâ€™t know what next steps to take.

I am wanting to contribute to a traditional IRA and convert to a roth IRA for 2019 (before april 15th deadline). As I was doing some educational reading, I came across a paragraph that has me scratching my head:

""While income limits are a non-issue for the backdoor, thereÂ exists one importantÂ prerequisite to be able to properly execute the backdoor Roth.

We have the money for a down payment AND 10 months in emergency funding.  

My job and industry is not stable. I would even go as far to say, working in oil and gas, I could get let go within the next 6 months. I have a good job and am told not to worry, but you never know.  

My wife is a family law attorney and is solid. She has little to no worry in career.  

Our monthly expenses are about 3300, which her job covers.  

If we buy a 180k house with 20% down, our monthly payment will be about 1k (600 less per month). I am confident we can afford it with her income if worse ever happened.

The fact that they are considering buying a house because prices are ""starting to drop a little"" and they have been waiting for prices to come down suggests that they are anchoring on the previous high prices.

Furthermore, the user's emphasis on the potential savings of $600 per month if they buy a house instead of continuing to rent suggests that they are also subject to loss aversion, as they are framing the decision as a potential loss (continuing to pay $1600 in rent) rather than a gain.","The user is exhibiting a combination of biases that lead them to prioritize a potentially risky financial decision in the present, driven by a desire to avoid perceived losses and capitalize on perceived short-term gains."
gij9df,steamin661,"Currently looking to buy a home, which would reduce monthly expenses by $500. Have enough for 10% down and 1 year of emergency funds. Her job is solid. Mine is very rocky. Thoughts?

We live on Houston. She is a lawyer and I'm in oil and gas. After moving around for the last 10 years, we are pretty much set living here because of her great job.  

Her Salary: 75k
My Salary:100k  

We are looking at a 200k house with 10% down. PMI would be about $40 per month until we reach 20% (this has been verified by lender due to credit, etc.). Overall its well below our means.

Our current rent is $1600 per month, which is the going rate for the area. If we purchased a home, we would be looking at ~1k with taxes and insurance. A saving of $500 per month.

Prices don't fluctuate here like in CA (+/- 300k). And the location we are looking at has no history of flooding and FEMA classifies as low risk.  

The only negative to this situation is my job is rocky. Our monthly expenses are around $3k. We have 40k set aside for emergency (not utilized for house).  

Her job covers all the bills, and I think $500 less in monthly expenses is a plus. I understand homes have additional cost (I've owned 3 before now - we used to move a lot but now settled). However not $500 per month extra. It will also help with taxes. We currently have nothing to write off.

kwpofn,steamin661,"I just received a call from physical therapy place i went to last Jan 2020. They claim I owe a balance of $550. I can't pay that amount. What's even worse, it really feels like fraud...

I attended two physical therapy sessions in Jan of 2020.  

1st session: $100 for 1hr. 

2nd session: $100 for 1hr.  

I had insurance at the time. So I understood that I would have to pay something and it would go towards my deductible.  

Today the PT settelments office (Oakbend PT in Richmond TX) called and said I owed $500. They said for two sessions, the cost was $1200. Insurance paid $700. I owe $500.  

I just got off the phone with the actual PT office and asked how much it would be if I did not have insurance or wanted to just not use insurance, they said $125. By that logic, the MOST I SHOULD PAY is an additional $50 (already paid $100 per session).  

How is this legal or possible!?!! They can just charge whatever they want and if the insurance says they won't pay they then come to me???  

I'm very nervous and upset. What can I do?

kwr5tg,steamin661,"The fees on my new Nationwide 401(k) have me shook. Also, should I go traditional or ROTH? Ive added all my details in the description.

I am 34 male. Married. Wife is 28. We have no debt. Salary of 90k. Wife makes 70k. We rent an apartment in Texas (super high property taxes, which is why we rent and plan to move in \~5years). Our monthly expenses are around 3k. Savings are as follows:

&amp;#x200B;

**Previous employer 401k**: 90k

**ROTH IRA**: 14k

**Ameritrade balance**: 7k

**Wife ROTH IRA**: 13k

**SIMPLE IRA (Wife previous employer)**: 35K

**Ally Savings Account**: 65k (high savings as economy and COVID has us worried)

**Total**: 224k

&amp;#x200B;

Now that I have been at my current employer for a year, I can contribute into the 401k, however there are options Im unsure of and the the fees seem really high.

&amp;#x200B;

**Basic 401K details:**

* It is through Nationwide
* They offer Traditional and ROTH 401k
*  100% match for first 3%, 50% for next 2% (match is based on compensation, so I make 90k, so max match is \~$3600).
* They allow me to pick a single fund or I can build my own investments from a list
*  Nationwide 401(k) has really high fees. Examples:
   * AmFds 2050 TrgtDtRtrmt R6 - Annual Operating Expense of 1.26% - Per $1k it $12.60
   * Vngrd 500 Index Fd AS (VFIAX) - Annual Operating Expense of 0.91% - Per $1k it $9.10

&amp;#x200B;

Other important notes:

* I plan to max out my ROTH IRA and was also planning on maxing the new 401k, however the fees have me a little shook.
* I do plan on leaving this employer within the next couple years.

&amp;#x200B;

Questions:

* If I plan on moving employers in a few years, should I just not worry about the fees, as I can just roll the money over into another IRA or 401k? Therefore the fees will maybe drop significantly? **Example**: Invest 19.5k in 2021, in 2022 I leave employer and roll the money into my Roth IRA.

&amp;#x200B;

* Also, what is the thought process around ROTH or traditional 401k. It seems to be a fairly debated topic. Ramsey say 100% go IRA, however most other articles I read made the case for traditional, sighting that when people retire, their income will usually be lower and therefore they will actually pay less in taxes (assuming taxes don't substantially go up). Something else which might be important for this, is I live in Texas with no State income tax. And plan to move to either Washington or Oregon in the future. So I would be contributing in Texas and taking retirement outside of Texas.

&amp;#x200B;

* Last question, are there any obvious investment options I should invest into from the following list that they offer?

xwpytc,steamin661,"My insurance continues to deny my medical claims and im unsure what to do. Please help with advice.

I have been dealing with Chronic Pain for 5 years. Never had an issue with insurance not covering things. Six months ago I moved to Colorado and started a new job.   

I found a new Pain Management doctor so I could continue my medication. That was an ordeal, but fortunately got it taken care of. I have been going to this doctor monthly for last six months.   

Long story short, I have spent enough money on doc visits, medications, MRIs, and monthly medication that I should have already met me deductible and max out of pocket.   

The problem is, my insurance has denied every single claim from the Pain doctor. They have approved my MRIs, Meds, and regular doctor, just not this pain doctor.  They first said they didn't receive the needed medical record. I fought and fought and eventually got them to send. Months later they have reviewed and STILL denied due to coding issues and justification of services.    

I don't know what to do.   

I have asked my insurance for advice and they say there is nothing to do except ask them to send more paperwork.    

The doctor office continues to send and I keep being told it's not enough.    

The funny thing is, they approved my MRI this year and they pay for my medications each month,  but they won't approve the doctor costs? The same doctor who order the MRIs and writes my medication scripts.

There are around $2000 out of pocket costs that they have not approved. They show I have paid $2900, but in reality I have spent $4900. 2900 + 2000 (denied).    

My current doctor has recommended I see a surgeon and this year would actually be a good one cause on paper I have met my deductible and max out of pocket. But since they deny these claims, I am pretty much forced to keep paying out of pocket.    

I am very worried I would go to see the surgeon and they deny that too, then I screwed!    

What can I do?   

I have Anthem Insurance and the pain doctor is Mountain View Pain Center.

About 4 years ago, I finished my degree and initially started making double what I was at the time. Then 2 years later, I moved into a new position and nearly doubled that breaking into the 6 figure salary range, which is more than I ever thought I was going to make at any point in my life (hadn't made more than 30k/yr at that point and where I grew up 50k/yr was a perfectly fine place to stop.).

So of course I had some lifestyle creep, but nothing excessive. My wife and I had kids, needed an actual house and a second car but absolutely nothing out of our means. I have a 401k that I max out to ensure I get at least some savings. After bills and everything there should be about $1500 left over each month, but this always disappears.

Last month it was $1000 in medical bills, before that it was $700 in HOA dues + $300 for some small unexpected house repairs. This month it was $1000 in minor repairs for our older vehicle. Next month my dog is due for a vet visit with shots and flea medication, which will probably be close to $500. It seems like this has been the case almost every single month since I started my new job.

Do these types of expenses ever slow down? I just can't seem to put away for an emergency fund when they're eating up what is supposed to be my leftover money every month. Despite making what I thought was a ton of money, I'm still living paycheck to paycheck and not even doing anything fun with it.","Recency Bias, Mental Accounting","The user is exhibiting Recency Bias by extrapolating their recent experience with random monthly expenses to their future expectations, assuming that this trend will continue indefinitely.

I was notified this week that my job is going to be eliminated in 30 days. I'll be receiving a 2-month severance package, but unfortunately after that I don't have much left in saving due to multiple family emergencies this year. So with what I have, the next month of pay and the severance, I can maybe squeak by for 4 months of bills.

My current monthly expenses are around 6k, and I've already cancelled pretty much everything that isn't essential. The last 2 big 'optional' things are pre-k for my kids (1300/mo) and our second car (500/mo). Taking the kids out of school would either make it harder for me to find a job or would mean my wife would have to quit hers. My wife makes about 2000/mo after expenses.

* Can I still draw unemployment with a severance package and what's the cap on unemployment (was making roughly 150k/yr)?
* I assume the 529 is the easiest/smartest to draw from if necessary, but what about the others? Additionally, I'll have to roll the 401k into something else; any suggestions (my IRA came from a previous 401k).

My company has decided to streamline our health insurance policy next year and is removing/replacing a lot of options, and it's very difficult for me to decide what is the best decision. My current plan felt like a fine balance of medium monthly premiums + medium deductible + low co-pays.

Here is a summary of my new options:

* 5 Plans. Only the highest has co-pays. Lowest 2 tiers are irrelevant for me.
* Yearly premium difference between Plan A and B is $3000. Plan C is $3000 lower than Plan B.
* Deductible for Plan B is 3x that of Plan A, however, both have the same Out of Pocket Max.
* Deductible for Plan C is 1.5x higher than Plan B and Out of Pocket max is 1.25x higher.
* Only Plan A has co-pays ($25 office / $50 specialist / $150 ER). All other plans are 100% out of pocket until deductible is met (except preventative care).
* All plans include 100% preventative care visits as outlined by the US government.
* Monthly premiums are taken out pre-tax.

At face value, it seems like I should choose Plan B or C unless I expect to pay more than $3000 (or $6000) in specialist/non-standard office visits per year.

We were looking for the past 8 months but our timing with COVID, low inventory, and low interest rates really made it difficult as we watched ourselves get priced out of some of the better areas.

* $230k Investments (would only liquidate for emergencies, capital gains taxes/etc.)

* $237K 401K

* Net take home excl. bonus/equity is ~$5.2K after HSA/401K contributions against ~$2.1K in monthly expenses ($1100/rent and ~$1K food/entertainment/misc) = ~$3K monthly buffer currently

* I rent a room in a nice $1M+ home with 2 other older gentlemen (55+), but now in my 30s and entering the dating pool again feel like it's a bit weird. Main reason I was here was because ex was getting her masters and living at home rent free, and we decided to save as much money as possible for a house when she graduated.

I'm looking at condos with an all in monthly payment (mortgage + HOA + Insurance + Taxes) of ~$2.5K in more desirable areas where it would be easy to rent a 2nd room (Irvine, Costa Mesa, Tustin).

I'm pretty sure I'm forced to leave it there because I'm going to get hit with capital gains tax and don't plan on liquidating it to use anytime soon (i.e. probably not until I retire in 30 years...)

Was just wondering what people's thoughts are on that (and maybe American Funds in general?), ideally I would love to just centralize everything but not at the cost of paying a bunch of taxes which probably won't be offset in returns anytime soon.

lqp7s3,Strife025,"Does anyone have suggestions on updating Cost Basis for in-kind transfer of mutual funds?

I just finished doing an in-kind transfer to consolidate my portfolio from American Funds to my Fidelity account. When I was younger my uncle was managing my investments in American Funds which has a really high ER (hence why I consolidated now that I'm in my 30s and am more actively managing my own money with index funds).

The transfer for non-retirement funds is held in 12 American Funds mutual funds totaling ~$260K, it had regular investments from 2007-2016 as well as dividend reinvestments, so not a simple cost basis.

Fidelity is giving me the option to manually update my cost basis for these mutual funds I just transferred and from what I've read online you can update only once using one of 4 different methodologies. Was wondering if anyone has advice on the best approach for this. What happens if I were to sell these funds to re-balance my portfolio without updating the cost basis?

Eventually I want to re-balance into a more simple index funds approach similar to my Roth IRA/401K, but trying to figure out the capital gains I might pay if I actually sold the ~$260K (my principle investment was about half of this, but because of dividend re-investments and paying taxes on that over the years I'm assuming it's not super simple). 

My thought process was to liquidate whenever another dip happens, since I'll lower my capital gains tax and I'll be instantly balancing into index funds which have also dipped. I've already paid up-front sales fees on some of the mutual funds, so don't think I need to rush re-balance immediately even if the ER is like .5% vs .1% for an index?","Anchoring, Sunk Cost Fallacy, Present Bias","The user is considering updating the cost basis for the transferred mutual funds and is aware of the different methodologies available.

lr77nv,Strife025,"Looking for general advice on investment allocations across taxable account, 401K, &amp; Roth IRA.

I'm 36 and in the process of taking a step back and completely rebalancing all of my investments after years of just throwing money into funds without a real strategy. I didn't take advantage of tax advantaged accounts as much as I would have liked (for example only contributed 6% into 401K for the 50% company match and instead invested the rest into taxable investment account instead of maxing out 401K contribution limits).

I've read a lot the past week on asset allocations and investment across your entire portfolio and was hoping some people with more experience have some advice. I'm currently planning on investing in the 3 fund approach 65/20/15 asset mix. I was planning on using ETFs in taxable account (VTI/VXUS/BND), Mutual Fund index's in my Roth IRA (FSKAX, FTIHX, FXNAX), and my 401K is limited in options so I only have Vanguard targeted 2050 or 10 individual fund options with State Street S&amp;P 500 Index, VTSNX, and State Street U.S. Bond Index being most relevant for this allocation.

These are my current assets:

* $352K in individual taxable account with Fidelity

* $237K in 401K with Fidelity

* $132K in Roth IRA with Fidelity

* $101K in High Yield (lol) savings account as I'm in the process of looking for a ~$500K condo and will be putting 20% down

* $5K HSA (ignoring it for this purpose and have 65/20/15 self contained re-balance option since this isn't a true investment account)

As you can see, I haven't really maximized by tax deferred accounts (i.e. 401K) which is making it somewhat challenging to rebalance things. I'm planning on taking the 15% LTCG tax on my individual account to exit long term positions on high ER mutual funds and some individual stocks to rebalance. I anticipate saving less in taxable accounts in the future as I have since increased my pre-tax 401K and HSA withholdings and when I buy a condo my monthly cost of living will increase ~$1K/mo. I currently save about $30K of my net income per year which will probably go down to ~$10K after the above adjustments and increased expenses.

So the root of my question is based on reading the bogleheads wiki and balancing assets across all your account types; i.e. stock index funds are best in taxable accounts (Individual) -&gt; tax-free accounts (Roth IRA), and bonds are best in tax-deferred (401K). I'm thinking these are my options and not sure what is best:

1. Holding VTI in my individual account which is ~49% of my overall investment assets (excluding savings/HSA) and then balance the rest with my 401K/Roth IRA to get a 65/20/15 mix with emphasis of bonds in 401K as second priority. Knowing that I don't really want to rebalance my taxable account moving forward due to capital gains tax it seems like holding the biggest mix in there makes the most sense and balancing around it? I don't anticipate liquidating much/if any of my taxable account barring some unexpected emergency. I'll slowly fund up my savings account back to ~6-12 months of living expenses after I use it for a down payment.

2. Since I have limited options with my 401K not sure if it makes sense to just to buy into the 2050 target fund and completely remove it from the mix and manually balance the rest around my Roth IRA/individual account?

3. Completely isolate all 3 accounts and balance each individually. Turn off DRIP in taxable account and use future savings to continue to balance asset mix so I don't have to sell positions to rebalance. This probably seems like a less ideal option?

4. Something Else??

mdcria,Strife025,"Advice on down payment currently sitting in savings accnt earning practically nothing

Back in March 2020 when the markets were dropping like crazy I pulled $70K out of my taxable portfolio as a hedge against further declines (dumb but was ~10% of my total personal + retirement accounts so not the end of the world). The thought process was to save this for a down payment on a condo that I wanted to buy anyways in the next year. 

Fast forward to now, I've put offers on 3 places but a combination of high demand and low inventory has made the market insane and I've lost all 3 places even though I've offered $30-$40K over listing. 

I've been kind of dejected on buying a place for now (first time home buyer in my 30s), my friend/family suggested just waiting until vaccine roll out and hopefully inventory becoming more normal. Even if prices stay the same at least there will be more options since everyone says it can't stay like this forever. Right now not only are things expensive but there's also very few good options.

So this brings me to the root of my question, I currently have $90K ($20K for emergency fund that will remain) sitting in a HYSA earning .4% interest which I feel like is a huge waste. I'm debating putting $70K back in my Fidelity account since I'm probably not going to even attempt to purchase a place again for 6 months.

The second part to this is that I have some positions (few large cap single stocks and some high ER mutual funds) in my taxable account I want to exit and move to market index funds (i.e. VTIAX). I've recently decided to simplify my investing into a 3-5 fund approach (total market + bonds + couple sector focused index funds). My thought process is that I can put this $70K into VTIAX and when the time comes that I decide I want to purchase a place again I can exit my other positions that I want to do anyways (so LTCG and not STCG on this $70K).

I'm aware that the market can always shift/correct and there's a risk to losing money in the short term, my thought process is mainly that because I'm not actually pressured to move from my current situation I could just ride it out if that happens (I have a good living situation in a place I've lived at for 5 years and only pay $1050/mo in rent in a HCOL area in SoCal).

mi1kx1,Strife025,"Balancing between Traditional, Roth, and Mega-backdoor Roth contributions

Alright so this is a bit of a complicated question and there's probably not one good answer, but figured I'd see if anyone has good insight.

I put together a spreadsheet of my current annual income and estimated expenses with precise tax calculations based on Fed/State tax tables for 2021: [Imgur Income](https://i.imgur.com/AznsIi3.png)

I'm currently saving a large portion of my income mainly because I live well below my means and don't feel the need to spend money.

The Summary is:

* 138K gross

* 47K-40K taxes depending on 401k contribution options

* ~28K expenses

* 65K-71K Assets (depending on taxes)

In the next couple of years I expect to buy a Condo and my expense obligations would go up ~18K (mid scenario) still allowing me to save ~50K/yr.

I'm 36, single (ended a 5yr in Feb), and have really been analyzing my portfolio this year (less about individual fund allocations and more overall strategy between accounts for tax purposes). In the past, I've just been doing 401K traditional, Roth IRA, and rest into individual taxable/HYSA. I'm at the point where I have too much money in non-retirement because I haven't been utilizing all my retirement account options (I didn't max my 401K or HSA in the past). 

I'm also trying to figure out how best to balance with Traditional 401K if I start doing mega-backdoor Roth. My 401K plan with Fidelity allows for after tax contributions which I started this paycheck, I also called them and they confirmed that I can do in-service withdrawals on after tax dollars and theoretically I have the ability to do mega-backdoor although the rep wouldn't advise me on the process.

**Current Assets:**

* $6K HSA

* $100K HYSA (emergency fund/down payment)

* $137K Roth IRA

* $244K Traditional 401K

* $359K taxable non-retirement

**Questions:**

1. My plan is $75K/yr in net retirement income with a retirement goal of 60-65 mainly because I don't mind working right now (so could very well have more than I need). Assuming this is 401K/pre-tax dollars that would be ~$100K gross. Because this is lower than my current gross income of ~$138K I'm trying to figure out if it makes sense to continue traditional 401K or switch to Roth 401K (or some hybrid)

2. In relation to the above, I'm really trying to minimize contributions to non-taxable at this point and ""catch-up"" for retirement accounts. This is why I started to research into mega-backdoor Roth this year. My plan is to contribute ~20K post-tax dollars automatically from my paycheck into 401k and do an annual backdoor (so will still probably have some non-retirement contributions but way lower than the past). Knowing this, does it make sense to contribute $19.5K to traditional to lower my taxes ~$6K/yr if I'm putting $26K into Roth as well (vs $46K into Roth and none into Traditional and eating taxes now).

I posted about maybe finding a fee based financial/retirement planner yesterday for questions like this but people suggested just posting here instead first.. so wondering if anyone has good advice :x

On one hand I really want to own a place eventually, on the other hand I have a pretty good living situation currently and save a ton of money in a HCOL area. I've lived in a really nice 4bd/3bth 3K sq ft house with two other guys for the past 5 years, 1 mile from my job, in a nice neighborhood... I only pay $1050/mo. We have a $4,200/mo lease which has stayed the same for 5 years and one roommate has the master + office room so pays half.

**Thoughts:**

* To put an offer down I would need to sell more of my taxable investments (20% down or really no chance in this market), plus extra for closing costs, furniture, etc.

* Mortgage + Taxes + HOA + insurance would put me at a ~$2.8K monthly payment which is about the limit I'm comfortable with for my salary. My plan was to rent out a room but don't want to base my ability to make payments on that.

* I'm currently maxing my 401K, Roth IRA, HSA, + an extra ~$2K/mo, I wouldn't be saving the extra $2K anymore and may not be able to max out the 401K without a roommate if I purchased a place (accounting for maintenance, unexpected stuff, etc.)

* Buy vs rent calculators say renting is better if an equivalent place is less than ~$2K/mo (7 years staying put). It's kind of hard to compare because I have 2 roommates but also live in a nice house ($1K/mo) vs living in a smaller place (but my own) for $2.8K with the potential to rent out a room for $1K (net $1.8K). This puts both scenarios roughly the same financially if I rent out a room, so I'm basically trading more responsibility and dealing with a renter vs worry free living situation and not having to deal with any extra work.

Part of me thinks I should not buy a place for now and just keep saving aggressively until I actually need a place, the other part thinks that as I'm getting older I really should think about buying a place...

Just wanted to get people's thoughts from a financial perspective.

obwh1x,Strife025,"Has anyone ever successfully appealed getting charged for ""preventative"" lab work?

Sounds like this is fairly common.. but I'm in my 30s, went in for preventative checkup which is supposed to be covered under my Blue Shield of CA PPO insurance.

Doctor visit was covered, but most of the blood work isn't even though it's what I imagine most people would consider preventative, so now I'm paying out of my deductible for it.

pxdnm6,Strife025,"Opinions on buying new car in current situation

So I'm basically getting 50/50 split from friends &amp; family pushing me to get a new car vs driving what I have now, wanted to see what reddit thinks.

I'll preface this by saying it's not strictly financial, and I'm someone who is very frugal despite my income, think it's a combination of a few factors but thought this is maybe the best place to post this.

**Background:**

* 36 years old, driving the same 2001 civic since I was 16; bought new myself after working my ass off for 2 summers to put a down payment, cosigned by parents, continued to pay off thru college 

* $140-$150K/gross income, save ~$50K maxing out retirement accounts (401K, Roth IRA, HSA) + extra into taxable brokerage using 3-fund portfolio strategy

* Car also only has 134K miles on it as I don't drive much anymore, only drive ~5K miles/yr at this point. Live in SoCal suburbs though so still need a car with no public transportation and things a bit spread out.

Recently due to it's age some cosmetic stuff has been ""falling apart""; headliner is starting to separate in a couple spots, driver side tint starting to peel off, black rubber around window starting to dry out and peel off... nothing major but still kind of annoying. Also I have some work coming up in the near future for ~$1K (2nd new timing belt/water pump since 2009 was last time I replaced them, slight oil leak which needs new oil pump). 

Overall I think for the age it's in pretty good shape though, and yes I'm aware I'm 36 and driving a ""riced"" out civic still although it's not loud at least :):
[Car Pic from Today](https://i.imgur.com/TRCwWzw.jpg)

With that all said, some F&amp;F telling me my car is still fine, just continue driving it. If you asked me this is what I would say as well... also hesitant to buy right now because of inflated market.

Other camp says I should drive something more age appropriate since I'm getting older and have disposable income, also added caveat that I recently got out of a 5 yr relationship and will need to date again soon... 

If I do buy something it will still be pretty conservative, maybe another civic or mazda 3 or a step up for a camry/accord. I really want a Lexus IS but can't justify the price for how little I drive...

Grandfather left trusts for three grandkids as beneficiaries.  He named his only living daughter a Kira as trustee.  Kira is not married, doesnâ€™t have kids or friends and is a spiteful person.  Trust is for health, education, maintenance and expense, and potentially gives the trustee leeway to make decisions on whether to disburse or not.  Trust also states that â€œKira cannot be removed for any reasonâ€.

Kira doesnâ€™t want the beneficiaries to have any money. Most requests are denied or have strings attached like they have to pay out of pocket for reimbursement which make it difficult to get anything.  Only things like medical or dental are for reimbursement, any other requests get flat out denied.  And still they need to be paid by the beneficiary first.

When beneficiaries ask questions about the trust, the trustee will not be direct and uses a tactic of charging an attorney large bills in the sum of $2000-5000 to answer questions on her behalf.  Trustee will make subtle jokes to the beneficiaries about not getting money â€” sent a birthday card  to one of the beneficiaries saying they get nothing.

We have the next 7 years to make the most of this resource for them.

I could open 529 but i don't want to tie up too much  specifically for education.  Our retirement is all about the boys for the first 10 years.  We got a late start and we have to make up as much as we can.

That means their education expenses might include relocating to the city they go to school (probably within the state)  Or even moving overseas.

So im looking into putting money into the HSA as i could read that might be a good extra for retirement. but im wondering how long can i wait to pull out money fro that accounts to reimburse myself fo bills

like if i go to the dentist and get a 6k bill next month. Can i keep this receipt around for 30 years and then use it to pull out the 6k ?

Now the actually money stay on your accounts since it move back and forth no need to actual move it just make sure the papers are therey

Once you die those money in you is you kids that you borrowed so they get there money back first before inheritance is divided out and taxed

I'm also thinking about finding maaby a HYSA that has a good SUB to make up for the lower interest and then move it around quaterly/yearly to get new SUB's. any recommendations for good subs is welcome

\- I am putting asside to my 401k whcih is invested in a target fund

\- I am putting in my max for my HSA

\- House is refied and new intereste rate is to low to be interesting for a locked placement

\- 1 car is paid off. The other  is also a bit to lower to be interesting for faster payment. also paying it off might  lead to getting new cars faster so  not accelrating this one

\- No kids in the US.  kid in birth country turns 18 this week  so that is a no chase as well for now

You will often hear people recommending a 15year mortgage over a 30yar because it cheaper. But that perspective often ignores opportunity cost and the fact you are utilization more resources to make it cheaper.

The alternative is to use a longer mortgage and use the same resources to grow faster than the debt and you will most often outperform financially on the 30year mortgage.

The results in most cases a 30year mortgage you can pay back faster and cheaper than a 15year mortgage

This is called opportunity cost. You lost out an opportunity on the extra monthly payments you are using on the 15year loan.

The premise is simply. You use the same amount of money every month as you would with your 15year mortgage but instead of it all going to the mortgage. with the 30y mortgage you use the different in monthly payments to invest.

Aka instead of $1200 going to mortgage on a 15 year mortgage, you do $800 to mortgage and $400 to retirement/investments.

This also have the benefits that in slim years you would be draining your EF slower as you are only responsible for a smaller monthly payment

Half a million less

Bottom line is you need to consider the entire impact on your finances when doing a mortgage and not just the impact on the cost of the house.

if not, you might just cheat yourself from a lot of money

&amp;#x200B;

Investment are not a sure thing which is why averages was calculated. you might value a stable growth more than and unstable growth. My thumb of rules is  that stable growth is twice as good as unstable averages. so any  with and interest rate above  half the average in investments  could  be prioritized above investments

&amp;#x200B;

**TLDR: 15year loans with today low interest rates will in average hinder your finical growth tremendously and/or increase the time to pay of the mortgage**

&amp;#x200B;

Full disclosure: I did not take in gains taxes I was assuming 401k/IRA or something similar as investments vehicle.  Any gains taxes will limit the differences.

&amp;#x200B;

\---

**ON RISK**

it seems that alot of people are not understanding what averages are doing and claiming stock market risk was not calculated in the picture. 

It was. that is how averaging something does. it take bot the high and low and gives you an number of what it all sort outs to. it was clearly indicated tha the average used for the stock market was taken from look at the performance over  50, 30 and 10 years on the stock-markets. THIS INCLUDES THE RISK ON THE BAD YEARS

&amp;#x200B;

Now on loosing your jobs. let me reiterate.

if you have lost you income the worst thing you can do is have a high expense. with a 15y mortgage you have a higher expense so you are saddle tighter.  Your drain your EF faster you are running a higher risk of defaulting and being hit bit all the bad stuff that comes with that

on a 30y mortgage you can stop putting in funds in your investments decreasing your monthly expense directly, straddling you less  tight, Reducing the strain on your EF.

**30y mortgage makes it EASIER to ride out a bad time.**

and that is not calculating the fact that you have a big chunk of liquidity in your investments for easy access that is not only EASIER to acceas than the equity in your home. but also BIGGER.

Everyone keeps telling me that ""renting is throwing away money""

I'm pretty sure I'm staying in the area I am in, a MCOL area. My rent is $1200 a month (likely to increase to $1350ish in July)

I am 24

I am interested in retiring early, (aiming for late 30s, 40s if I have to).

I made $134,000 last year, though my base pay is somewhere around $65,000 per year. My employer offers large overtime incentives, which should be decreasing and I assume I'll make $100,000ish in 2023.

plgayk,swaggy_butthole,"(US) Trying to plan for retirement (22), what is the best way to allocate my funds? I have a 403b, 457 b and roth IRA

I am 22, and I live in Kentucky. My base income is $58,500/year. I plan on working overtime throughout the year; my place of work offers significant overtime pay, often an extra 40$ an hour or so (on rare occasions can be up to 80$ hour on top of regular pay) where I usually make about $30 an hour.

I don't think it's important to spell out my expenses here; I live well within my means and limit spending wherever possible. My plan is to retire as early so I am planning for that now. I have roughly 4 months of expenses saved up as cash as well as liquefiable assets (crypto and stocks.) I have no loans or debts whatsoever.

So, as far as retirement goes I have the 403, 457b and roth IRA as my options. I also have an HSA. So balancing these funds in the most advantageous way possible is my goal here.

**What I've been doing**

My employer offers a 200% match for my 403b, up to 5% of my pay so that's a no brainer (I made a post before that mentioned this and people mentioned over and over how that's not possible, no one does a 200% match, etc. Yes, it is 200%, I am positive.)

On top of that, I've been putting $500/month into my Roth, $200/month into my 457b, and $200/month into my HSA (my employer also contributes $1000/year into my HSA).

**What I'm thinking about doing**

Employer matching is only available for the 403b, so that portion definitely needs to stay

I am thinking about completely striking the roth contribution from my retirement plan. From my research, the 457 and 403b seem to perform better. over time (assuming tax savings are re-invested.) 

Since I am taxed at about 31% (state, local and national). I might have done my math wrong there, so if anyone thinks it should be different let me know. but taking away the $500 a month from the roth would leave me with about $700 a month to invest. I think the best move is to try to max out my 457 if possible, it seems to be objectively superior to the 403b, especially since I plan on retiring earlier.

I dont expect any major health costs anytime soon, but there is the HSA I have to think about as well. I am thinking what I might do is add $500/month into my 457 and $250 a month into my HSA with the money left after taking out my roth contribution.

I have only been working for 3 months (pretty much fresh out of college) and haven't had a chance to work overtime yet. I would like to make enough to max out my 457 this year at which point I would probably contribute any extra savings into either my HSA or possibly my 403b

is the roth even worth touching? It sounds great if you're low income but I can't imagine my income bracket would be higher in retirement than it is now.

In 2016 my dad died. He was a lifelong academic (professor) and had his retirement invested in TIAA. My mother handled his finances and was extremely risk-averse, so everything was placed in either an annuity or a money market account.

My mother died last year (2022). My sister and I are the named beneficiaries on the TIAA account.

However, TIAA now tells me that because I am a â€œ2nd Generationâ€ beneficiary (i.e., Dad â€”&gt; Mom â€”&gt; me) the IRS wonâ€™t allow me to roll over the account into an Inherited IRA.

Didnâ€™t get any responses on my last post, so Iâ€™ll try again. 


Hey all, I've been checking in on my retirement portfolio lately, and I have a few questions.  I'll list all my info first


33, married, first baby due in September


Currently maxing out my 401(k) and my Roth IRA, here's my combined portfolio between both accounts: (percentages are rounded)


25.5%  VTSAX (entire Roth IRA)

25%  FSPSX

16%  FXAIX

9.5%  FIDELITY CONTRAFUND (benchmark is S&amp;P 500, but only has 300 funds and different weighting. Also higher expense ratio)

7.5%  DFEVX

6%  MPC (a mistake, I know)

6%  FSMAX

3%  DODIX

.5%  VBMPX


Overall allocation:

63%  US Equity

32.5%  INTL Equity

3.5%  Bond/income


1)  I bought MPC through the employee stock purchase program in my 401(k) when everyone thought they were doing great.  Since then, the stock has done nothing but drop, and I am down about $4k from my total cost basis (25% of my MPC investment).  I still believe the stock will get back to where it was and beyond, but I don't know how long that will take.  When do you cut your losses on an investment?  I know I'm losing money on not being invested in something like FXAIX that is producing returns.  Should I hold or sell?

2)  Do I have redundant holdings?  Should I try to reduce down to 4-5 holdings or is it not that big of a deal?  Fees aren't really an issue.  My most expensive holding is DFEVX at .64% gross exp ratio.


3)  How should I use my money after I max out my 401(k)?  I put back 17% of my paycheck, and I will probably max out in October or November.  I can still get a 7% employer match through after-tax contributions.  I don't have much retirement savings outside of my 401(k) and Roth IRA.  Should I be saving money in a taxable account since I plan to retire when I'm 55?

fg3scc,Teddyworks,"Windfall advice, and also some retirement savings tax treatment

We could use some advice on our current situation. Weâ€™ll be having a windfall from the sale of a rental property soon. After paying off the mortgage, we should have about $25k leftover. Weâ€™re trying to figure out how to handle it. 
 
Me: 33
My wife: 28
First child due in September!!

**Income:**

Me: $120k minimum (hourly employee with plenty of overtime opportunities)
Wife: $60k

**Debt:**

$120k mortgage at 3.25%

**Savings and investments:**

$7k high-yield savings
$8k HSA (maxing out)
$120k 401(k) (maxing out)
$40k my Roth IRA (maxing out)
$8k her Roth IRA 
$4k Fidelity brokerage

**1.)** How should we use the $25k windfall?  We have considered paying it all as a principal payment on our current mortgage, or using it all to begin investing more in our brokerage account. Most likely would be in an index fund. I know I could probably have higher returns than 3.25% in the stock market, but it would also be a huge weight off our shoulders if we paid off the mortgage by the time Iâ€™m 40 too...

**2.)** We also plan to start maxing out her IRA. We have been thinking more about using a traditional IRA. Our AGI was $173k after our 2019 tax returns. It will lower a little bit next year after selling our rental property. If we used a traditional IRA, it might drop us down to the 22% bracket? I have always been confused on how to handle this situation, but I basically just split my savings 50/50 between pre-tax and after-tax. I can save Roth contributions in my 401k as well.

rxrbt1,Teddyworks,"Possibly purchasing farm ground in the future.. is it generally a good investment?

So we have a rather interesting family situation so itâ€™s a little tough to describe. Weâ€™re in the *VERY* early stages of this discussion, so Iâ€™m just trying to get a decent handle on things before more serious discussions and talking to lawyers and bankers. 

Essentially, my wife and I live on a 1 acre lot (we own) in the middle of a family owned (her family) farm land. We expected to have this land passed down to us (although I knew things might get complicated someday). 

Now, a family member that is the main executor (not sure thatâ€™s the right term) of the revocable trust wants to sell their portion of ownership in order to move away and stay close to their son in their retirement. 

So now we own our home in this cornfield and we are somewhat in a tough spot. Itâ€™s a lot of money. We would roughly be buying 70 acres of farmland. Itâ€™s already rented out to a farmer. Thereâ€™s also oil wells and we would have mineral rights, although I donâ€™t believe theyâ€™re major producers. Iâ€™m guessing a few bpd for each of the 4 wells. 

Letâ€™s presume that the cash rent and oil payments would cover 80% of the yearly mortgage and tax payments (since I have no idea of the specifics, only taking my best guess). So some money would be coming out of our pocket. We can afford this, although not saying itâ€™s ideal. 

Generally, I stick to the Boglehead approach, but it sure seems like a lot of people around here buy up land like itâ€™s the best investment. I guess what Iâ€™m asking.. what kind of things do I need to think about ahead of buying? Obviously I donâ€™t know much about land ownership. What are some benefits that Iâ€™m not seeing? (Tax deductions, tax write-offs,government programs..) what are some disadvantages or expenses that Iâ€™m not seeing?

tue4ba,Teddyworks,"35m/upper-middle income/married/1 child; Where do we go from here??

I've always been a financially inclined guy, and always loved saving/investing/planning, etc.  I've been realizing more and more that I kind of feel like we're plateaued.  We could easily just continue on as we have been and have a fantastic retirement and all those normal things.  We also feel like we are capable of more, and being a Boglehead.. it's very hard to feel like you're accomplishing much (even though you are).

&amp;#x200B;

So we're kind of looking for ideas.  I've really been thinking we need to meet with a CFP, which is on our outlook as well.  I'll give a quick rundown of our financials

&amp;#x200B;

**\*\*Income (combined) -\*\***

\- 2021 AGI $185k

**\*\*Debts -\*\***

\- Home - $108k 14 years left @ 2.25% (Appraised at $165k)

\- Minivan - $18k 3 years left @ 2.5%

**\*\*Savings -\*\***

\- HYSA - $35k (emergency &amp; large upcoming expense)

\- Brokerage - $50k (mostly S&amp;P500)

\- 401k - $250k (Pre-tax)(max-out every year)

\- Roth IRA - $95k (both accounts combined/ max both out every year)

&amp;#x200B;

So we had saved up to remodel our kitchen which is why we have such a large savings.  Well we got to that point and we really weren't inclined to follow through.  Then we got word of a future opportunity to buy a large amount of income producing farm-ground from family (roughly 80 acres @ $6k-$10k/acre).  So we've kind of held on to this money to see how that situation turns out.

&amp;#x200B;

We're now kind of at an impasse.  The farm-ground purchase could go either way, and still might be a few years out before its available.  We've considered real estate, but our schedules are so hectic, that I'm not sure it's viable for our happiness/marriage quality (we both work shift work).  Rentals are promising if they're quality properties that wouldn't need much renovating/maintenance.  We're in a small town in Southern IL, so higher rent prices can be a tough sell.

&amp;#x200B;

We've kind of held off on paying down our debt because the rates are so dang low, and we feel we have a pretty safe cushion should something happen.

The company I work for matches 50% up to 6% of pre-tax income so with that and reading around the webs about contributing 15%-20% of your gross income and since I get paid weekly, how much should I invest per paycheck? I put down 10% per paycheck and I get paid about $420 per week so thatâ€™s $42 a week into my 401(k). Am I doing too much or is this fine? 

I was going to follow the 50/30/20 rule and since 20% goes to savings I figured Iâ€™d take 10% weekly and put into my companyâ€™s 401(k) and the other 10% will go into my personal savings.

So as I said I bring home about $420/week and if I break that down via the 50/30/20 rule, that gives me $210/week for needs, $126/week for wants and $84/week for savings. 

Needs are around $550/month, Wants run about $50/month and then after the 10% contribution into my works 401(k) Iâ€™d have $42 left per week to throw into personal savings.

So Iâ€™m starting to budget and trying to get a hold on my money and am currently looking at going with the 50/30/20 Rule. My question is since I mostly see that 401(k) is counted along with the 20% savings, how should I go along breaking down my weekly check via this rule?

So to break it down imma low ball on how much I usually bring home per week:

$400/wk (itâ€™s usually more than this by maybe $20-$40, but to be on the safe side Iâ€™ll say only $400)

Now Iâ€™ve got two bank accounts, one at Ally and the other at Capital One. Ally is for bills and emergency fund since they have the savings buckets so each paycheck Iâ€™ve got 70% going into my Ally Checking which then I split up into needs and savings. The remaining 30% of my paycheck goes to Capital One for my Daily Checkingâ€™s for you guessed it wants and daily stuff. 

My question is, since the 401(k) is taken into consideration for the 20% savings and Iâ€™m only putting in 6% into that, that means Iâ€™ve got 14% left to budget into an emergency fund savings so with that 70% Iâ€™m putting into my Ally account, should I divvy it up as 56% into my Bills and then that 14% into emergency fund or just keep it as is 50% still into Needs and 20% still into Savings?

Hey everyone! Iâ€™m a 24 year old guy living with my parents. 

I just graduated college in December after 5.5 years. 

From 2016 through the summer of 2019 I built what got to be a large, fast growing, and successful business until I closed it in August last summer. 

Over the course of almost four years I worked with hundreds of clients and built a name for myself until it all came crashing down. 

I had only paid myself $1,000 a month as a salary and mistakenly reinvested every penny back in the business without any kind of cushion or saving anything for myself. 

The failed business left me heavily, heavily in debt at 23 years old. $68k to be exact 

Iâ€™m an entrepreneur to my core. At 24 Iâ€™ve never had a â€œreal jobâ€ working for anyone but myself. 

Iâ€™ve been working on launching a new business, but the shame, anxiety, and fear has lead to mental paralysis. 

Itâ€™s just this big secret Iâ€™m keeping.

While I am paying them $500 a month for rent, My parents have no clue. They arenâ€™t very supportive of me being an entrepreneur as it is and we are on shaky ground relationship wise because of it. They make good money but they couldnâ€™t help even if they wanted to.

I got myself into this mess and somehow some way will get out of it myself. 

Throughout last fall and early this year Iâ€™ve went to each creditor one by one and explained my situation. Theyâ€™ve all been very understanding. 

The payment plans Iâ€™m on with each creditor are manageable and very, very long term (two creditors make up 75% of what I owe and both have me on 4 year payment plans), but just the thought of having that much debt for such a long time is causing me so much anxiety. 

None of the debt is on my credit report. My score is 680. 

The one thing that scares me to death is the UCC lien Kabbage filed for the the loan I took toward the end of the business.

I guess my question is how do you remain productive and at peace mentally while in debt? How do you pace yourself? 

Iâ€™m a big thinker and am not the most patient person. The thought of it potentially taking 4 years to be debt free alone leaves me paralyzed mentally if that makes sense.

i5h02m,thesonofnarcs,"Why you have to look beyond the balance sheet: A Cautionary Tale

For almost 7 years I was a dyed in the wool value investor. I did very well. 

As I would look back on stocks I passed on investing over the years I saw many of them went to zero or close to it. 

So, I got the bright idea of using LEAP put options on companies I would never go long on. 

I started in the casino, hotel, and resort space. I spent two weeks one by one researching and then ranking each company based from strongest to weakest on all the metrics and benchmarks Graham talks about in the Intelligent Investor (interest coverage, what their bonds yielded, working capital, credit rating, etc.)

My goal was to find the absolute weakest company in the sector/industry. A company with an atrocious balance sheet that was barely surviving. 

In my mind I thought it would be the perfect one to bet against. 

I found it. It was Penn National Gaming (PENN). They ranked number one as the weakest company. They have billions in debt, negative working capital, negative tangible book value, and not enough money before tax to cover the interest payment.

They have had to continually issue new shares and dilute their stock. Their current shares outstanding are 200% higher than they were 4 years ago. 

PENN reached a low of $3.50 during the March crash. When I finished my research it was at $28.

My thesis was that with the company being in such horrible financial shape and their casinos being closed for so long would take the stock back down and potentially make the company file Chapter 11. 

Even if their casinos reopened I did not think that they could survive on a fraction of their former traffic. 

With all that in mind it seemed like it was possible for the stock to go back to what it was in March. 

I had such conviction I invested $1,000 in puts with a $3 strike that expire in January.

I made one big mistake. I didnâ€™t know about Dave Portnoy when I initiated my position. I didnâ€™t think Barstool could generate enough revenue to save them. 

Dave Portnoy is the equivalent of Elon Musk in the sports world. Just like Elonâ€™s tweets move Tesla Portnoy has been able to move PENN.

I donâ€™t blame him. I just made the mistake of overestimating the influence one person can have on a stock. 

Today the stock is worth $49. I bought my puts when stock was at $28. 

Iâ€™m down 70%. The money I lost does sting, but it doesnâ€™t bother me. 

I went in knowing I could lose it all or make 42X my money. I saw it as an asymmetric bet. 

But, at 24 years old this lesson will stick with me the rest of my investing career. 

Look beyond the balance sheet","Overconfidence, Confirmation Bias, Anchoring","The investor's narrative reveals several biases.

onieor,thesonofnarcs,"PayPal contracted my debt balance to a collection agency and then took it back in house?

I owe PayPal $40,000 from a failed business two years ago when I was 23

In the spring of 2020 after not hearing from them for almost 7 months I emailed the executive team/CEO and told them my story. 

I asked for a payment plan. 

Some high level executive had the COO of the debt collection agency they contract with (meaning they didnâ€™t sell the balance) call me personally and oversee my account. 

He was managing my account personally (meaning the main agency wasnâ€™t calling and it wasnâ€™t in their teams system). He knew my story and basically just said to pay when I can and what I can and that PayPal would be monitoring my payments.

I paid off $4,000 of it in a year. 

Today I called to make a payment and was told that the account was removed from the agency and to call PayPal. 

My hope was that it was sent to another agency that I could set up a new payment plan with.

I called PayPal and was told it was back in house with them. 

I guess I wasnâ€™t paying fast enough?

The problem is they donâ€™t and wonâ€™t accept or set up Payment plans because itâ€™s not a line of credit and thereâ€™s no interest (itâ€™s just a negative balance).

They said that I can call and make partial payments as often as I want but thereâ€™s nothing to setup. 

The lady in the collections department also didnâ€™t know how long theyâ€™ll keep it in house.

They also wonâ€™t settle. The collection agency was willing to knock $10,000 off.

Iâ€™m a little freaked out by all the ambiguity from PayPal. I had a smaller balance with them in another account (that Iâ€™ve since paid off) from the same business and they called my parents house at all hours. 

I made it clear that I only wanted them to call my cell phone only. She said that wouldnâ€™t be a problem but it doesnâ€™t give me much comfort.

This suggests that the user is biased towards changing their current situation (Status Quo Bias) due to a perceived negative trend. Additionally, the user's concern about Vanguard's customer service ""getting really worse"" implies a potential loss, which may be influencing their decision, indicating a possible Loss Aversion bias, as they are motivated to act to prevent further decline.","The user is exhibiting a bias towards changing their current financial setup due to a perceived decline in their current provider's service, driven by a mix of a desire for consolidation and a fear of continued deterioration."

Wil part B be cheaper if someone sign up under their spouse with longer earning history? Or it doesn't matter?",Anchoring,"The user is considering whether signing up for Medicare Part B under their spouse's earning records, which have a longer history, will result in a lower cost. This suggests that the user is anchoring on the idea that the spouse's longer earning history is a relevant factor in determining the cost of Medicare Part B. The user is likely assuming that a longer earning history will result in a more favorable outcome, without considering that Medicare Part B premiums are generally the same for everyone, regardless of earning history.",The user is exhibiting anchoring bias by relying too heavily on the spouse's earning history as a factor in determining Medicare Part B costs.

Currently I'm making about $50 an hour with W2 and benefit, if I add 30% as 1099 so \~$65 an hour, is that fair?","Anchoring, Mental Accounting","The user's decision-making process is influenced by the current hourly wage of $50 as a W2 employee, which serves as an anchor when calculating the desired hourly rate as a 1099 independent contractor. The user is also mentally accounting for the benefits associated with being a W2 employee by adding 30% to the current hourly wage, effectively treating the benefits as a separate mental account that needs to be compensated for when transitioning to a 1099 status.","The user is relying on the current W2 hourly wage as a reference point and adjusting for perceived differences in benefits, rather than making a more objective assessment of the 1099 hourly rate."
