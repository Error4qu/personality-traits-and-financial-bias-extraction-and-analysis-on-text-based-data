10y2qrj,multicm,"Reasonable return for a conservative investment

I am 26 and I currently max out my Roth 401k ($22.5k per year). At the end of each month I have roughly $500-$600 leftover that I want to do something with, (This is exclusive of $500 per month I set aside into cash savings for emergencies which I already have $12k in)

In reality I do not have an actual purpose for this money, it is more to fill the gap because the ultra-short term and low-return of cash savings (currently 3%, but typically much lower) and ultra-long term and higher return of my 401k (2065 target date fund). But I do not need immediate access to it, and it doesn't need high returns, I just want to play with new investment instruments and diversify.

Based on the flowchart it is recommended for me to put this in a Roth IRA which I do have and had originally planned on doing, but then I started thinking, what are the conservative returns on things like Bond Indexes, Gold, etc. (various conservative investments)?

The alternative is I put the extra money onto my mortgage (3.25%) which is not much better than a savings account but would diversify me more into Real Estate vs Cash. Which also has a slight advantage of making it harder to access.

I am 26 Years Old (should retire around 2063), currently I have 50k in my 401k and it is 100% in LIWIX (Blackrock 2065 Target Date Fund) but recently I have been hearing more and more about Vanguard. I learned that Vanguard doesn't do Target Date Funds (at least not any that my 401k plan allows) but instead I could use their ""Growth"", ""Moderate Growth"", ""Conservative"", and  ""Income"" plans to basically mimic a target date fund, I would just need to reallocate between these plans over time, which is completely fine with me.

The question I have is starting now at 26 I would want to be 100% in the Growth fund which is VASGX. So would it make more sense to switch to that or just stick with my existing Target Date fund?

For a bit more detail, I am NOT considering this reallocation because of anything currently happening in the market, I know times are weird and I believe either option would work just fine for me. The only reason I am reconsidering is because of the lower expense ratio with Vanguard (0.14% compared to 0.21%), and because of any potential reviews I hear from Vanguard vs Blackrock.

fi3h14,multicm,"Target Date Mutual Fund Question

I created a graph today that shows the trend of Blackrock Life Path Mutual Funds based on their target date and it shows what you would expect the 2025 fund dropped the least in the past month and the 2060 date dropped the most with a gradual gradient between.

My question is, even for the 2025 fund the drop is still significant (15% drop vs 27.5% for 2060 fund), is this typical? It seems like for people only 5 years from retirement I would not expect their investments to be this volatile.

I'm only 23 so I don't truly care much about how the 2060 fund is doing now since it will obviously recover, but I am concerned that when it is 2055 my fund could also drop by more than what I would consider safe when only 5 years from retirement.

My lease ends in September and due to a few different circumstances I need to move out and into a different complex.

I have 2 existing debts: 

* Student Loans (4.9%) which will be $7,500 in December 2021 
* Ashley furniture Line (0%) which will be $3,000 in December 2021

My question is, when December comes around I will have roughly $24,000 saved up for a house (This is outside my emergency fund). The homes I am looking at are around $220,000.

lo7azr,multicm,"How Much House to Buy?

I know these questions are asked on here hundreds of times a day and I apologize for adding to that list...

I and 24 and currently make $66,000 a year and I currently have $13,000 in house savings for a down payment. I live in a MCOL town with ""standard"" 3/2 homes around $260k. If I don't mind a 30-minute commute I could probably get that figure down to $230k. Honestly, I do not like any of these $220-240k homes I have seen, they all feel small and dated and the apartment I rent for $900/month (my portion of rent with a roommate) is much nicer, but I want to get into the market and stop paying rent, so I am prepared to buy whatever I can afford. Based on my budget I believe I can routinely afford $1,700/month in fixed housing costs (Mortgage, PMI, HOA, etc.). That would be 30% of my income. I just want to see if that is an acceptable amount.

Few things:

1. I have very minimal debt: $70/month to a 0% interest financing credit card. And I will have $7,000 in student loans when I graduate grad school in June 2022 (I'll come back to this at the end)
2. I am currently living under a budget where I am spending $900/month on rent and saving $1,200 a month for a house and an additional $300/month in E-Fund savings. And this budget doesn't feel tight; I can continue to live like this. So That would mean once I have a house my rent+house savings of $2,100 can now be reallocated as $1,700 to housing costs and an additional $400/month to E-Fund because I know homeownership can be expensive.
3. I am single but will have a roommate (not that his rent will be used in calculating what I can afford)

On the topic of my master's degree, it may be quick to assume I should just wait the 15 months and get a house when I graduate, but there is one thing to note there. My employer has informed me they intend to give me a sizeable raise when I graduate. By the personelle policy, I will get 7% at a minimum. But they also told me when I graduate I will be promoted to ""Data Scientist"" and will be given a salary for this position as is standard in my area and industry. My research on Glassdoor has provided me with $90k as a starting data scientist salary. With my 4 years of work experience with this company, I believe I may be getting a bit more than that. But the reason I say all this is, I want a house before getting this promotion. I don't want to allow that lifestyle creep by looking at houses I will be able to afford when I am making $90k+. So I would rather get a house I can afford now and enjoy the extra income in a year. With that said, I am comfortable will going on the high range of ""affordable"" for my current budget for this exact reason.

m7w1h7,multicm,"How to calculate debt to Income when buying a House as a Student

I have 2 debts, a furniture credit card which has 0% interest and I pay $70/month, and student loans with a current balance of $5,500. I make $67k a year. My issue is I am currently in graduate school and my student loans are for this degree so I am not paying anything on the loans until I graduate (especially since the interest is deferred for COVID). I graduate May 2022 and then I will start making payments. And to make matters worse the student loans will still increase for 2 more semesters (roughly $2,500 a semester).

I am looking to buy a place in the next 6-ish months, I have the necessary down payment and emergency savings. So when they are calculating my debt to income how will they handle my student loans? I don't know what my monthly payment is because I currently don't have one. And I know they say to not do ANYTHING debt related while closing on a house, but what happens if I am closing around august and now need to pay for another semester ($2,500), I could just pay that semester in cash, but no reason to do that if I don't have to since it is 0% interest through at least October.

mrg6hw,multicm,"Understanding balance between DTI Ratio and 3x Housing Rule in Wiki

I posted here a couple days ago that I am closing on a house June 1st and I am crunching some numbers and they are not quite making sense to me. I have no debt, and do not ""expect"" any debt going forward (new car already paid off, no children, and already graduated). After running the numbers, when I buy this house I will have 35% DTI, which is good in the eyes of the Wiki.

After making a budget with this new housing costs (I already got the breakdown from my lender, so I included PMI, Home Insurance, HOA, mortgage, etc.) I am left with $650 a month which I can save and that is on top of my retirement and not including any income from a roommate.

nfbcb0,multicm,"Understanding the balance between better life for kids and better retirement

I am not having any children anytime soon, I don't even have a girlfriend, but I got into a discussion with some family this week and I wanted to get some input from this subreddit.

Growing up I was very fortunate to have the parents I did, they are great people, but more related to the question at hand, they spent lavishly on my brother and I when we were young, Disney vacations, cruises, etc. I traveled a lot when I was a kid and I never thought anything of it financially but I knew I was fortunate. Well fast forward 20 years and I have a better picture of what was going on, my dad is in good shape but could have been in much better shape. Basically he makes good money, has minimal debt, but his retirement is less than I would have expected him to have for the money he makes. And this is all due to the money he spent when my brother and I were young. Entire vacations were on credit cards. His philosophy was he would take care of finances once we moved out, which he did, but of course minimal retirement contributions when he was younger has had a lasting impact.

So my question for everyone who has/had children is, how do you determine this balance? I believe I was shaped, for the better, by the lavish trips we took when I was younger, I saw a lot of this country and I had a very happy childhood. I would love to give the same to my kids one day, but I don't think I want to be as risky as my parents were.

At first I thought I entered something wrong but that isn't the case so is TurboTax wrong or right?...

I bought my house June 1st and my friend starting renting from me (25% of the house) on the same day.

He has paid $800/mo so $5,600 total

I have another stock that has made $500 in value.

I'm about to submit my 2022 taxes. What steps do I need to do to correctly report a Roth IRA recharacterization that I did in 2022 for Roth IRA contribution in 2021? Do I need to report 1099-R form on my 2022 tax return? If so how?

Hi, Iâ€™m looking for some advice/help understanding the optimal way to use my 529 plan to pay student loans and minimize tax.

Currently, I have: 

* $40k in a New York 529 plan
* $10k in federal student loans
* Iâ€™m 27, no spouse, no kids
* Earn ~200k

I learned that distributions to pay qualified education loan repayments from a 529 plan (up to $10k lifetime) are considered nonqualified withdrawals for New York State tax purposes and will require the recapture of any tax benefits that have accrued on contributions. 
(https://www.nysaves.org/home/make-withdrawals.html)

Questions: 

1. My student loan interest resumes in September. Should I withdraw $10k from 529 plan to pay the loan off? 

2. Would I get taxed only by the NY state (and not federal)?  I think Iâ€™d get taxed at 6.25%â€”which would be $625 total for the $10k distribution + city taxes.

p8ehzu,Nblearchangel,"Interviewing at multiple firms and I need to set priorities

Currently, my existing employer is talking about promoting me but I put in some apps several weeks ago. Iâ€™m 35 and unsatisfied with career prospects where I am now because management just doesnâ€™t know how to develop people. Itâ€™s a young firm. 

The promotion theyâ€™re proposing would be from an entry level role to a management role. A big jump for sure, however, Iâ€™m extremely uncertain how much theyâ€™ll be willing to pay me. Based on expectations Iâ€™d be making less than I could make elsewhere but I definitely wonâ€™t be able to get manager on my resume anywhere else. 

Thing is, Iâ€™m finally hearing back from those apps I put in. Iâ€™ve heard back from two in particular both of which are massive companies, Salesforce and Deloitte, and I imagine Iâ€™d get proper career training/development at either. The only things I learn in my current role are things I seek out on my own, and even then the learning opportunities are sparse. Thereâ€™s just so few resources where I am. 

Iâ€™m jumping the gun a little and I havenâ€™t gotten an offer at either place but I want to leverage this opportunity. Do I wave an offer letter around to my boss demanding more than they planned on paying me?  In the event I get an offer I imagine it would be significantly higher than my new promotion would pay.

To skip my back story, last year I made life changing money for my family, and I have really started to resonate with Dave Ramsey (donâ€™t know the general consensus anymore for him, but whatever). He suggests, as you should, focus on paying down all debt to get a fresh start and to start what he calls the baby steps. Problem is, with our income last year, we jumped all the way to the end goal and now I have to figure out how to work backwards.   
  
To be brief, the only debt we have is our two vehicles (combined loan value of ~$69k, both brand new), a camper ($11k) and the house mortgage ($150k @ about 3.5%); outside of this, we are debt free (credit cards paid monthly, etc)   
  
As far as assets go, not including value in the house or cars we have:  
$120k 401k
$500k HYSA (money market)
$620k individual brokerage 
  
So at this point, do we just really drain the HYSA and start over 100% debt free?

11ecwqa,Nickyweg,"Did I set up my T-Bill ladder correctly ?

Okay so I have a savings account Iâ€™m just using for T-Bills. 

It currently has $40,200 sitting in it. 

I have buy orders for: 

3/7 - $10,000

3/14 - $10,000

3/21 - $10,000

3/28 - $10,000 

My goal is to have it auto-reinvest where I can stop it if I need access to the cash, but will be completely automated if I donâ€™t. I have 6 auto-reinvests on right now. 

I also have $5,000 that will mature on 3/28. I just left that on auto re-invest too. 

Iâ€™m not going to be overdrawing anything with this math, right ?",Status Quo Bias,"The investor appears to exhibit Status Quo Bias as they seem comfortable with their current setup, having a T-Bill ladder in place with auto-reinvestments, and show no inclination to make significant changes or explore alternative strategies. The investor's primary concern is ensuring that their current setup does not lead to overdrawing, indicating a preference for maintaining the existing state of affairs rather than evaluating potential improvements. The fact that they have left the $5,000 on auto-reinvest without questioning or adjusting the strategy also suggests a resistance to change and a comfort with the familiar.","The investor displays Status Quo Bias by favoring their current T-Bill ladder setup and auto-reinvest strategy, showing a preference for maintaining the status quo and avoiding potential changes, even if it may not be the most optimal approach."
11erouc,Nickyweg,"Whatâ€™s the best move for our student loans ?

Iâ€™m not holding my breathe for forgiveness so Iâ€™m trying to plan my best moves. 

My fiancÃ©e and I make 150k. Weâ€™re also trying to move out and get a house later this year (350k house or 250-300k townhouse with about 100k down). 

I have: 

25k of student loans in my name (3%)

40k of Parent Plus loans in my dads name. (6-7%)

I was planning on just doing Standard 10 year repayment on mine because the payment is only like $200 a month. 

For the loans in my dads name, would it be beneficial to consolidate or use the â€œdouble consolidation loopholeâ€ to get those on income based repayment but based on my parents income ? My parents make about 110k combined. 

FiancÃ©e has: 

8k in her name that we were just going to pay off when forbearance ends. (3%)

120k in her moms name. Weâ€™ve agreed to help them with like $400 a month. Iâ€™m going to get them on income based since their household income is so low (60k). (5%) 


Are we still in a good position to buy a home later this year? Weâ€™ve been living with my parents to amass this â€œwar chestâ€ of savings and would like to buy a place of our own.",Status Quo Bias,"The investor shows signs of Status Quo Bias, particularly with their approach to managing their student loans. For their own $25k student loans at 3%, they plan to stick with the Standard 10-year repayment plan, which results in a relatively low monthly payment of $200. This decision seems to reflect a preference for the current state, as they do not consider alternative strategies that might be more beneficial. Additionally, their inclination to maintain the status quo is evident in their plan to simply continue with the existing repayment plan without evaluating other options, such as consolidation or income-based repayment plans that could potentially offer more favorable terms.","The investor tends to favor maintaining the current state of their student loan repayment plans, showing a preference for sticking with familiar and straightforward options rather than exploring alternative strategies that could potentially be more beneficial."
11y0mm4,Nickyweg,"Should I pay off the bill for a large purchase thatâ€™s at 0%?

Hey all. So I purchased a watch online for myself. It was about 5k. I was originally going to pay via wire, but decided to use my card for protection. It looks like itâ€™s 0% until next year. 

Would it be bad to move the money to a separate savings account and get some free money out of it? (Maybe $100-$200?) 

Is there any danger to this ? 

My income is secure (we make about 150k combined) and I have the willpower to not spend the money on anything else.",Status Quo Bias,"The investor is hesitant to take action and move the money to a separate savings account, despite the potential to earn some extra money. They seem comfortable with the current situation, having purchased the watch with a 0% interest rate, and are now questioning whether it's worth taking a risk to earn $100-$200. This suggests a preference for the current state and a resistance to change, even if it may be beneficial. The investor's secure income and self-proclaimed willpower to not spend the money on anything else imply that their hesitation is not driven by a rational assessment of the risks, but rather by a bias towards maintaining the status quo.","The investor exhibits Status Quo Bias by favoring the existing situation with the 0% interest rate over exploring an alternative option that could earn them extra money, due to a preference for the current state and discomfort with change."
12yvvum,Nickyweg,"Is it time to exit T-Bills?

I have a 4 week T-bill ladder currently that auto reinvests. I just checked it and the 4 week bills are 3.2%. My savings account pays 4% currently. 

Is there any disadvantage to transitioning my T-Bills back into my HYSA? 

It seems like the debt ceiling drove them down and from what I can tell, that wonâ€™t be resolved for a while. Is there a chance this weeks auction rebounds ?",Status Quo Bias,"The investor exhibits signs of Status Quo Bias as they seem to be hesitant to make a change to their current investment strategy, which involves maintaining a 4-week T-bill ladder that auto-reinvests. Despite the fact that their savings account now pays a higher interest rate (4%) compared to the T-bills (3.2%), they are questioning the potential disadvantages of transitioning back to their High-Yield Savings Account (HYSA). This indicates a preference for the current state and a resistance to change, even if it might be beneficial to switch to a higher-yielding option. The investor's consideration of potential risks, such as the possibility of this week's auction rebounding, also suggests a reluctance to deviate from their current investment plan.","The investor displays Status Quo Bias by favoring their existing T-bill investment strategy and hesitating to switch to a potentially more beneficial option, their High-Yield Savings Account, that pays a higher interest rate."

Went in and paid $200 for two fillings a few weeks ago. I just got a letter from Cigna that a claim is delayed pending receipt of additional information from the dentist.

Is my dentist trying to get more money out of my insurance plan / use up my deductible ?",None,"The statement provided does not exhibit any signs of Status Quo Bias. The individual is questioning their dentist's actions and expressing concern about potential overbilling or insurance fraud. This indicates a critical and inquiring mindset, rather than a preference for maintaining the current state or resisting change.

13jgaj9,Nickyweg,"What causes 4 week T-Bills to pay a higher rate than 8 week ?

Iâ€™ve transitioned my 4 week bills into 8 week as the rates were higher. This week, 4 week bills are a full 1% higher than 8 week bills (4.7 vs 5.7%). Why?",None,"The investor in this scenario does not exhibit signs of Status Quo Bias. Instead, they demonstrate a willingness to change their investment strategy, as evidenced by their transition from 4-week bills to 8-week bills when the rates were higher. Additionally, when the rate dynamic shifts and 4-week bills start offering a higher rate, the investor takes notice and inquires about the reason behind this change. This behavior indicates a proactive approach to managing their investments and an openness to adjusting their strategy in response to changing market conditions. There is no indication of a preference for the current state, inertia, resistance to change, or a reliance on default choices.","The investor does not display Status Quo Bias, as they actively adjust their investment strategy in response to changing market conditions and do not show a preference for maintaining the current state."
