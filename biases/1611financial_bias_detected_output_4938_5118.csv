ql5oit,rvH3Ah8zFtRX,"Is there a place for riskier investments in the name of diversification?

A bit of background: I'm 33, household income is about $200k annually, we own a home with a 2.65% interest rate and the monthly payment represents about 20% of our gross income. No other debt. We're contributing 20% of our paychecks to retirement, plus employer match on top. In these retirement accounts, we're invested in primarily VOO / VTI. At the end of each month, we have between $1.5k and $2k ""unbudgeted"" money which is typically used for one-time expenses, splurges (like vacation, furniture, etc) or most often, savings. So as best I can tell, we're doing what we're supposed to and we're ""on track"". 

That last category of ""extra savings"" is the focus of my question. I have a few industries / sectors that I'd consider myself quite knowledgeable on, and I'm bullish on their long-term outlook. Up to now, I haven't allocated a single dollar to investments outside of total market index funds. And in hindsight, I've missed out on some large gains. That's not to say that they'd continue to do well, or that 100% of my picks would have ""beat the market"". But it feels overly conservative to not have any exposure to these opportunities.

Again, to be clear, I wouldn't be touching any of my retirement savings. This would be in a taxable brokerage account of ""leftover"" money that could have easily been spent on PC parts or dining out instead. Point is, this isn't money that I'm depending on for anything.

Anyway, just wanted to start a conversation and get some thoughts. The amount I'm considering would likely represent about 5% of my investments.","Loss Aversion, Overconfidence, Confirmation Bias, Anchoring, Recency Bias, Affect Heuristic, Sunk Cost Fallacy, Present Bias","The statement exhibits several biases.

The focus on their own knowledge and outlook, without mentioning seeking external opinions or data, implies Confirmation Bias.

qnefzl,rvH3Ah8zFtRX,"Property tax payment lost in cyberspace

I've been dealing with a terribly convoluted property tax payment situation. The short version is that our taxes are escrowed, our mortgage company didn't pay them due to a ""discrepancy"" (which they made no attempt to resolve), then transferred our mortgage to another company and our taxes became delinquent. Then I had to get the new company to understand the situation, make the payment, and cover the late fees.

Miraculously, that all seemed to happen. The new company paid the taxes and said they would cover the late fees. And indeed, they removed the money from my escrow account. That was on October 18, and the tax agency still says they have not received a payment. I went back to my mortgage company, and they confirmed the property tax ID and showed my account statement which shows the money being withdrawn. Yet the county still says ""Nope, haven't received anything.""

stz4ba,rvH3Ah8zFtRX,"I was preparing to ask for a raise. Should the CPI increase influence my request?

I accepted a new job about a year ago and got a nice raise in the process. I've been quite happy so far - fully remote, lots of autonomy, relatively low stress, pretty good benefits, and good career development. But about 6 months ago, I started to get contacted by recruiters. I took introductory calls for 3 different positions, and the base salary ranged from 10% to 20% more than my current salary. And I was planning to bring this up during my annual review.

I don't necessarily expect to get open-market rates, but there is clearly a gap. I'm prepared to discuss my request from a performance perspective.

syqtiq,rvH3Ah8zFtRX,"What is the best way to justify a raise given inflation and labor shortages?

Lets say you're happy at your current company, but feel that the market rate for your skills has increased over the past year. Maybe that's partially due to 7 - 8% YoY inflation, which seems like a valid concern when discussing cost of living adjustments. But I've seen several people say citing inflation is a bad strategy, since it doesn't say anything about your contributions.

The conventional wisdom is to demonstrate your value to your company, Which I suppose is always valid. But over my career, I've had mixed results with trying to translate various accomplishments and achievements into dollar values for the company. It's usually ""Good job, and we hear, you, but there's no budget."" 

But given then current worker shortage, I wonder if that dynamic has been flipped somewhat. That a large part of your current ""value"" is your very presence in the position. And if they don't recognize your value then it's their loss, and replacing you will turn into their headache. 

Personally, I've been contacted for a few jobs which pay between 10 and 20% more. I'm wondering if the best negotiating tactic is simply sharing my newfound market research, and telling them I have no desire to leave but will be forced to listen to these opportunities if the gap in compensation remains so large.

txnjdz,rvH3Ah8zFtRX,"Likely receiving a job offer for a huge raise. But I don't want to leave my current job.

I'm 33 and have worked in my industry for 8 years. I'm currently holding a senior-level role where I'm viewed as an expert and have the chance to work on a wide-range of interesting things. My boss has trust in me, and I'm given autonomy to work on my own. It's relatively low-stress.

I was recently contacted for a new job, and the recruiter suggested that I should request a 75% raise. The company said they couldn't meet that, but could offer a 50% raise and double my current annual bonus (a 65% raise overall). I'm interviewing now, and it seems like I'm the top (perhaps only) candidate. 

The catch is that I'd be working exclusively on a very narrow aspect of my current role, and I'm not necessarily excited about that. But the money is hard to pass up. So I'm very conflicted.

Has anyone navigated a similar situation before? I've only been at my company for one year, and I suspect they'd hate to lose me. But most companies don't go around giving out 50% raises easily. (For what it's worth, I feel that I did receive ""market rate"" a year ago. I had several competing offers all around the same level.)

uqxam5,rvH3Ah8zFtRX,"New job offer includes ""phantom equity"" with 100% match. How should I value this?

I am currently considering a new job offer. It includes base salary + annual bonus. But there is an interesting ""phantom equity"" component to the bonus. Essentially, I may defer up to 30% of the bonus which the company will immediately match 100% (with a 3 year vesting period). Both the deferral and election become indexed to the company's common stock valuation for the duration of the vesting period.

I suppose there are two aspects of this:

1. Is the immediate 100% match (plus 3 year vesting) a good deal?

2. What is the expected return of the phantom stock shares?

I'm inclined to say #1 *is* a good deal. I can't think of many investments which would offer a guaranteed 100% return over a 3-year period. Although if/when I eventually leave the company, I could have up to 3 years of deferred money which will not receive that match.

The second one I have no idea. The company is a project developer (intentionally being vague here) and is receiving sizable funding from financial institutions and major industry players. So since it's not publicly traded, there's no share price I can look up. And I have no idea what ""increases to the company's common stock"" actually means.

I joined my company in April 2021. My offer letter says ""Eligible for an annual bonus of up to 10% base salary.""

The annual review process wasn't started until Feb 2022, and they laid out a timeline that said they expected headquarter approval on raises and bonuses in March, with them being paid out in April.

On April 29 our CEO sent an email saying that bonuses were still in the approval process and would now likely be May.

But as of July 1, I started a $100k job, and the IRS withholding calculator says I need to increase my withholding or else I'll owe a large amount next year. Why is that? Why wouldn't it just continue to be withheld at the proper rate? 

I have a guess, but I'm not sure if it's right - that my new company thinks I'm going to be earning $100k for only 6 months, so $50k total for 2022.

gwje1r,Sagarsaurus,"What should I do with my vested RSUs?

First off, I've been on this forum for a while but haven't really ever posted anything. I've found this subreddit to be very helpful though, you guys give some really good advice!

Just to explain my situation: I'm currently 26 years old and I worked at Oracle for 3 years from 2015-2018 and received RSUs from them. I didn't sell my RSUs at the time (wanted to avoid short term capital gains and didn't know at the time that selling them immediately would just give me the cash in my hand). So, I held onto them and have around 28.2k in ORCL stock sitting in my fidelity account (cost basis was 25.8k). I know that if I sell now, I will have to pay long term capital gains on the roughly 2k of growth, but that's not a huge deal. My question is more about what I should do with the money if I choose to sell, or should I just keep holding the RSUs?

If I do sell, I have 26k in an emergency fund in Marcus, max out my 401k every year, and am likely going to backdoor 6k into my Roth IRA soon  (unfortunately I don't think I can do a Roth mega backdoor). So with the proceeds leftover from the RSU sale, what do you guys advise that I do? I could put it into an index fund, or into other stocks, but I'm not quite sure what to do since I can't really put it in any tax advantaged accounts now. Can anyone give me some advice?

h80rr8,Sagarsaurus,"Have significantly excess savings, need help making a choice

Hi Reddit! I'm 26 and recently sold some RSUs and with my company bonus that came in in March, I have around 50k sitting in my savings account in Marcus. I've recently taken an interest in my finances and found that I was doing pretty much all that this sub recommended to begin with.

I'm debt free (paid off my student loans years ago), my 401k is maxed out every year and I backdoored the annual max into my Roth last week. I'm not currently eligible for an HSA and so while I do have a good amount of money sitting in savings, it just doesn't make sense to have it sit there with the 1.3% interest that Marcus is giving me. I know this will go up eventually, but I'm ok with taking on some risk to get some extra gains with that money. I also have some minor money in Fundrise (about 1k invested) and about 3k in robinhood (which is actually up 100% all time with my initial investment being 1500 3 years ago). I also have 5k in crypto holdings. Lastly, I have about 1k in my Fidelity brokerage account that's the result of me not using DRIP earlier, and so I invested the dividends from my original RSUs into some other stocks. The total value of those assets is around 900, so it isn't really anything significant. 

I do plan on proposing to my girlfriend by the end of this year (the ring has already been bought and paid for) and we will likely get married sometime by the end of next year. Naturally the next step after that would be to have kids and buy a house, but those are all goals that will come with time and conscious savings as I go. I'm currently able to save about 2k a month after tax so I'm not too concerned about incoming cash flow, though anything can happen.

I was just looking through my finances and I found something that may allow me to contribute to my Roth. I just wanted to check my logic. From 2015-2018 I had just started working and while I didn't really know what I was doing (live and learn I guess), I made a Roth contribution back in 2017. No worries there as prior to this year, I was below the income limit for  a Roth. However, last year I had a bit of a rough year and hopped between a few jobs and finally by August landed in my current job, which is now well above the Roth limit. After I filed my returns for this year back in February though, my AGI for 2019 was 78k or so, primarily because I worked for a month in February, and a month in May, and then August till the end of the year. If I had my current job, which I joined last August for all of 2019, I wouldn't have been eligible for a Roth contribution. But, am I correct in thinking that if my 2019 return shows an AGI of 78k, then I can contribute to my Roth for 2019 through July 15th? I backdoored 6k into my Roth for 2020 as I'm above the income limit now, but I haven't done anything for 2019 and the option is still available for me in Fidelity. Should I do this?

hp1qv5,Sagarsaurus,"Critique my retirement account allocations please!

Hi all! I've been working on properly balancing my retirement accounts and I would really appreciate some feedback on how they're setup. If something seems wrong or downright stupid, I would love to rectify those mistakes right now. For context, I'm 26 years old and am maxing out my 401k (have tried to do so since I started working at 21), and contributed to a Roth IRA when I was under the income threshold, and am now well over it, and thus started backdooring money into it.

So here goes:
For my current employer, they don't have a Vanguard target date fund. They do have TRPLX but the expense ratio is a 0.52 which seemed very high. So I set out to configure that myself. I currently have 10% in VBTIX, 27% in VTSNX, and used the remainder to approximate VTSAX by putting ~51% in VIIIX, 2.5% in VMCIX, and ~9.5% in VSCIX. This is supposed to line up in approximation of the total US stock index by putting 30% of stock allocation internationally, and of the remaining 70%, putting 81% in the S&amp;P 500, 4% in mid cap index, and 15% in the small cap index. In total, there is about 26k in this account currently and I am contributing twice a month to max out contributions for this year at 19.5k. My employer also matches 100% upto 3% and then 50% on the next 3%. 

My old employer 401k hasn't been rolled over because I have it in VILVX which is Vanguards target 2060 fund with a 0.12 expense ratio, and thought it wise to leave it there. In total, there's about 67k in this account currently.

Finally, in my Roth IRA I currently have 17.8k, I reallocated recently and 12k of this amount is very recent with new contributions (within the past month with me putting 6k in for 2019 because I was under the income limit, and backdooring 6k for 2020 because I am now well over it). In this account, ~31.8% is in FREL, ~20.6% is in FTIHX, and ~47.6% is in FXAIX. I am doing all of this in fidelity hence the fidelity funds. I recognize that this is the area in which I may be better off reallocating so please feel free to tell me what you think I should change!

I also have 52k in my HYSA with Marcus, about 1150 in fundrise (fun experiment), about 3600 in robinhood (180% return there) and about 6k in crypto (with about 500 invested). I make about 184k a year on my own in NYC but I plan on proposing to my girlfriend in about 3 weeks and she's almost done with medical school. I personally have no debt, and know that that will be a substantial amount to pay off, which her and I will do together.

I recognize that our incomes will put us in a high tax bracket and that we will be doing quite well for ourselves.

ic0ph6,Sagarsaurus,"Helping my younger brother plan for retirement

Hi all!

So, I'll just jump into it. I am a 26 year old Software Engineer and so I have been contributing to my 401k since I was 21 which has grown to around 106k (I didn't know about maxing out my contributions in my first 2 years of contributing) and I have a Roth IRA that I've been putting money into which is upto around 18k (missed a few years, young naivety). I'm maxing everything out every year so as far as retirement goes, I think I'm pretty set.

However, my 22 year old brother is in the hospitality industry. Specifically, he went to the Culinary Institute of America and is now a Chef. However, I fully understand that incomes in that field are nowhere near where they are in mine (unless one becomes extremely successful or is a celebrity). The more and more I think about it, the more I realize that at his age, he needs to find a way to invest in his future. However, I know that he doesn't really have the funds to do that. He makes about $13 an hour, for now. It may go up next year to around $16 an hour but still, his apartment is 1300 a month, and he drives to work and pays his own utilities (wants to prove that he can do things independently but my dad cosigned his lease for him because he didn't meet the income requirement). In essence, after all the other things that he pays for such as utilities, gas, and food/groceries, his student loans, and trying to sock some money away into savings, he's essentially living paycheck to paycheck. He saves about $200 a month, and his savings account is at about 3k now. My question is primarily, knowing this, what can I do to help him plan properly for his future? Should I give him money to contribute to his Roth IRA? I'm at about 184k a year in total income (160k base salary, 24k bonus) with about 54k in liquid savings.

He had 5300 in savings and we moved it into 2k to get his Roth IRA started with 2k (70% FSKAX, 30% FTIHX), 2k in Marcus, and 1300 left in his TD account for emergency transfer to his checking account. He currently makes $15 an hour and doesn't have any benefits, but he's only 22 years old. As of now this is all he has setup for finances and has the loans mentioned above.

o5dglf,Sagarsaurus,"Order in which my fiancÃ©e should invest for retirement

Hi all,

My fiancÃ©e recently graduated from med school, and will be starting as a resident at the start of next week. Her gross income will be right around 65k. I was taking a look at what retirement plans she is offered, and it looks like she's offered a 403b through TransAmerica. I haven't gotten to look at the funds just yet, but I'm not sure that those should even determine the order in which she invests for retirement.

The 403b plan has no match from the employer for her first year, as you have to have worked there for atleast a year before they will match at all. She is doing a transitional year which means her first year or residency will be at this hospital, and then the next 3 will be elsewhere.

With her income being what it is, and knowing full well what her salary will be after she completes residency, the advice I want to give her is to actually forego the 403b until she maxes out her Roth IRA contribution for the year. At that point, it's fine to put money into the 403b, whatever she can spare, because that still has some tax advantages.

After this year, she should continue this pattern until she starts getting a match from her new employer (2 years from now as I'm assuming they won't match for the first year either). At that point, she should contribute enough to get the match, then max out her Roth contribution, and then continue to try to max out her 403b.

I've never really made much money or held a job for a while so I've always had a scarcity mindset. I drove a beat up 2k car and never felt I should have something more.

We both make enough money to pay our bills and catch up, but it will take probably 2 years or so. Long story short, we let lifestyle creep bite us in the butt pretty good once we got better paying jobs and have learned our lesson. However, I would like to avoid paying stupid amounts of interest on our credit cards if possible.

Can anyone maybe help point me in the direction of diagnosing whether or not there is an issue? Everyone I have talked to, granted they live in various areas of the state, have an electric bill that is like 1/4 or 1/3 lower than mine. Our house is roughly 2500 sqft, with a 1500 sqft basement that has heat/ac, but the thermostats are on the main floor and 2nd floor (gas furnace and electric A/C are both the most efficient units you can purchase from Lennox).

&#x200B;

For example, our bill is around $300-450/month for electric/gas. Sometimes a little bit lower, sometimes a little bit higher. We have one of those thermostats where you can choose a heat/cool range. Ours is set at 70 for cool down and 66 for warm up and for the most part doesn't ever change throughout the year. Idk if it makes a difference, but we also have a whole-house humidifier built into the system.

I don't think there is really anything else that sucks the power quite as much.

I am an RN and am currently working in the hospital as a staff nurse. I will be there approximately 9 months before moving to another state. I contribute to 403b but I donâ€™t max the hospitals match rate because Iâ€™ll be leaving and 0% vested. 

As an RN, itâ€™s not uncommon to bounce around especially if you decide to do travel contracts. My goal/plan at the moment is to do 1 year travel contracting, settle down in the ICU for 2-3 years as a staff nurse and then apply to CRNA school OR go the Nurse Practitioner route. 

That being said, Iâ€™ll basically be â€œfreelanceâ€ for 1 year. Staff nurse at one hospital for 2-3 years before starting school. CRNA school allows work for the first either year or semester, Iâ€™d have to look but after that itâ€™s 100% school. NP school, you can work through. 

What is my best option here? Iâ€™m looking at 401k, 403b, and I vaguely understand IRAâ€™s but know theyâ€™re an option as well.

Iâ€™m making about $58,000 gross right now. I estimate to gross around $80,000 after traveling (but that could vary immensely.

Unfortunately I have a terrible habit of thinking about stuff at night....and then it never stops. So, I was reading the disclosure stuff regarding our mortgage loan we just received and if I am reading it correctly, after the first 7 years the mortgage insurance falls off (I assume that means at that point in time we will have reached the 20% mark required for MI?).

My wife and I are exploring adding an additional $150/mo towards our mortgage just to pay it off earlier than the projected 30 years. Given that, would the mortgage insurance fall off sooner than the 7-year mark? I would assume so but I don't know jack about this kind of stuff.

Also, if we plan to live there for 10-15 years, does it even make senseÂ to add those additional monthly payments? Again, I would assume it's a yes and it'll just equate to needing to pay off less of the home when/if we sell it but, I was just curious.

As a result of this accident I've been out of work for months but I'm projected to be medically cleared to work by early to mid 2021. Right now I'm taking advantage of the free time to learn IT work online and earn certifications. IT jobs in my state start out at a base of around $45k a year for just entry level.

There's tons of job opportunities, growth, and the housing communities around here are not only nice but inexpensive, ranging from $100k-$200k for a house. 

And this is where my question comes into play. 

If I receive a fairly large settlement, say $500k, I've wondered if I should buy a house around the area. Of course, I wouldn't do any of this until I have a stable, liveable job, but still. 

I absolutely love the area I live in. It's beautiful, warm, and there's lots of job opportunities. It's the fresh start I had been waiting forever for.

He said that since I'm buying it from him I'd be better off buying it outright when I get the money. That's fine by me, but I have also heard you can finance through a bank as well. I thought about financing a small amount of it to open a line of credit history and also to avoid paying a large amount of interest. Part of me really wants to just pay it outright and have the peace of mind of not having a payment, but part of me wonders if that'll hurt my credit in the long run. My credit is 755/758 Transunion/Equifax respectively, so it's in the ""excellent"" range. I have no debt other than medical bills (that will be paid out of settlement after insurance finishes covering things) and the small amount I spend from month to month, and I don't struggle to pay those.

With this settlement I plan to buy my dad's car for ~$14k and have a fully paid off vehicle. I'm currently not employed, but am actively job searching. My credit is excellent, I have no debt and currently live with my parents. We moved into a new area late last year and I absolutely love it here; it's beautiful, there's plenty of job opportunities, and the COL is only $35k a year. 

But I find myself in an interesting situation. A house in my neighborhood is for sale at $60k in a neighborhood where most homes are $100k+.

Hey all, been crunching some numbers lately and wondering if a potential future plan is in any way plausible. I currently work at a job I love making $12 an hour, but am working through training programs to progress my career and get pay raises. I work almost full time (will go full after probation) but currently make $1,920 a month before taxes. I'll make a bit more once I go full time though. I'm in a serious relationship and if we end up tying the knot and moving in together we'll make a total of $4,640 pre-tax. I have the idea of buying a condo in my area, which is very transient with people moving in and out all of the time, so I'd aim to pay it off and use it as a rental property in the future. Condos in my area run from $100-120k. I have a paid off car and no debt.$65k in the bank with my parents gradually paying back $40k I loaned them in an emergency.

I've told her the idea and she thinks it sounds good, as the idea is to buy one condo, pay it off, save for another, then buy a second one and rent it out, putting a tenant's rent toward the mortgage, rinse and repeat. It's a very long term plan but I'd like to own 2-3 condos as an investment strategy.

lwza14,Scryptiid,"What are the best resources those with experience can suggest for increasing financial literacy, and choosing my next steps?

TL/DR: 22 M, where should I learn more about personal finance? Where should I look into opening an IRA? Is it worth moving to online banking? What should I look for? What do you wish you had known/done in your early 20s?

Hello PF,

Iâ€™ll try and keep things concise, but Iâ€™m notoriously bad at that. For reference, Iâ€™m 22, working part time and until recently was a full time student. Iâ€™m taking a break from school to focus on some personal enrichment and pursuing other goals. I do have a A.S. degree in CIS. 

First off, Iâ€™ve felt for a year or so now like my financial literacy is not where I want it to be. Thereâ€™s a lot of concepts I want to learn and understand more about such as tax structure, investment (stocks and real estate primarily), and more effective ways to both budget and save. Savings accounts arenâ€™t the way to go. What are some good objective resources that you could suggest for learning these topics? I find I have a hard time trusting online resources to not have some form of bias or agenda. I donâ€™t have anyone in my life I particularly consider a good resource. 

Second, as idealistic and unrealistic as it may sound, I want to pursue financial independence. I donâ€™t want to rely on paycheck to paycheck, 9-5, Iâ€™m sure youâ€™ve heard it all. My efforts so far mean I have no debts, no loans, am slowly building credit with a card, just trying to make smart decisions. I have little financial obligation and can save a large percentage of my income. Next step seems to be putting money towards retirement? My employerâ€™s retirement plan is whack, and has little benefit to me so Iâ€™ve considered maybe an IRA? I understand the basic ideas but donâ€™t feel like I have enough information to make the optimal decision. A Roth seems smarter than a traditional for my circumstances, especially with zero sight on what retirement will look like for me. Iâ€™ve wanted to look into using TD Ameritrade for exploring/trying/learning about trading as well as potentially opening an IRA but would like to get more experienced opinions. 

Third and last for now, my current short term goal is purchasing another car. My hobby is tinkering with and building engines. My cars have always been a little unreliable and less than practical. Now I can finally afford to make a smarter decision. I have money in savings, that I specifically saved for this purpose, just waiting for the right car. I chose a while ago to reduce my spending budget so that I would have extra money to put towards investment, a retirement account, whatever it may be. Where should I start? I feel like Iâ€™ve learned a lot recently, but itâ€™s almost too overwhelming to know what I want/need to do.

After my last post, I'm hoping to be more specific about my lack of understanding. I have read the prime directive and generally understand the steps, and options for them.

I'm on break from college, but have paid it all out of pocket, and don't plan to have student loans anytime soon.

I don't entirely understand the differences in fund and investment offerings from the online brokerage options. I also don't really know how I would use a target date fund, because I have no idea when I would retire or how to gauge that. The earlier, the better. And lastly, I don't know if it's beneficial to manage my own investments (which would require a lot of research and learning from here), or to just fund an account I don't need to really manage.  


To clarify, I know what most of these things ARE, but not how they really apply, or what I need to personally pay attention to.

There are a couple questions wrapped up in here and Iâ€™ll try and make each one clear.

This includes maxing my Roth to the contribution limit. 

First, how should I divide my savings after that between more retirement and my next big goal which will be moving out? Not sure if I want to buy a place or rent, just know that itâ€™s my next big step. (Unless I go back to college, which will shift everything. Currently donâ€™t plan to.) PD mentions 15% for retirement first then to savings for something like a house but at that point Iâ€™d probably be decades from getting my own place. 

I trust others know better than me, so it would make the most sense if Iâ€™m doing that to just invest 15% of each paycheck, and the remainder into house savings? Or does someone have a better method? 

Related, whatâ€™s the next place I should put retirement savings if my employer offers nothing and my Roth is maxed? An individual 401k or something of the sort? I need to research the options listed in the PD but advice always helps. 

Second, as far as organization, Iâ€™d really like to be able to keep my goal savings, emergency fund, short term savings for small purchases, etc. all in separate places or views rather than piled in one savings account. It sounds like some online banking solutions offer this type of structure and organization. Is it worth moving my â€œbankingâ€ to one of these for this? Any suggested one?

From what Iâ€™m reading, ideal would be 20% savings (after requisite payments/needs are met and emergency fund is saved) towards retirement after doing everything possible to maximize savings in tax-advantaged accounts. Maxing is my current step, but Iâ€™m trying to lay out some numbers for after that, as I should have my IRA contributions maxed in a month or two. 

Once that is done, am I then taking 20% of my normal paycheck (paid monthly with extra in summer), putting that into a taxable account for retirement  (no 401k, pretty sure Iâ€™m not qualified for HSA), and then the rest being discretionary? By which I mean, Iâ€™m free to put that towards spending OR savings goals not related to survival? If not, what rate/percentage would be recommended for savings towards goals? I donâ€™t have a concrete time horizon. Sooner would be nice, but nothing necessitates it. 

Curious how others break it down. 

For reference, my long term goals are to save for a house down payment and another car. I understand financially the car is completely unnecessary and potentially inadvisable, but racing is a hobby and Iâ€™d rather not break my reliable transportation. Short term, Iâ€™m looking to build myself a computer. Otherwise, not much else I care to spend money on other than occasional outings when feasible. 

Iâ€™ve separated my emergency fund savings into another account to avoid the temptation of drawing upon it. Should my short term savings just stay in a savings account as well, while long term is saved in that taxable account? I struggle to understand how to differentiate retirement/long term savings (such as for the house) if both reside in the same taxable account. I canâ€™t imagine having two is a good idea?","Status Quo Bias, Present Bias, Mental Accounting","The individual exhibits Status Quo Bias as they seem hesitant to deviate from their current financial situation and are seeking to maintain their current state of affairs, as evident from their statement ""I'm trying to lay out some numbers for after that, as I should have my IRA contributions maxed in a month or two.""

oo3e7s,Scryptiid,"When should I switch to a traditional IRA vs my current Roth IRA?

Hello all. I just was doing some reading in another sub that reminded me I need to be considered this change.

ovciae,Scryptiid,"Understanding tax advice/allocation

Hello all. Iâ€™ve been reading through the PD and wiki, as well as some of the Boglehead articles and am looking for a little clarification. 

When I started putting money into an IRA, the advice was generally to use a target date index. And I understand the tax advantage to the IRA as well as other retirement accounts. 

Now itâ€™s about maxed, along with a finished emergency fund for now, and Iâ€™m putting extra money aside to invest in a taxable account. I donâ€™t have a 401k or HSA available to me currently. 

The boglehead advice to tax efficient placement seems to suggest that tax inefficient investments should be in a tax advantaged account, such as the IRA. Following that logic, a tax efficient investment like an index would go in the taxable account and things like REITs or stocks should go in the IRA? It seems like the advice kinda flips backwards. Hoping someone can clarify for me. 


To that end, I have other savings allocated for short term goals, so the taxable account is ideally going to be extra retirement/wealth accumulation in the long term. In the taxable account, is this where I should be looking at a three fund portfolio? Iâ€™m understanding most of the ideas, but not quite how they go together. I might just be missing something in the reading though.","Confirmation Bias, Anchoring","The individual is seeking clarification on tax-efficient investment strategies, specifically regarding the placement of tax-inefficient investments in tax-advantaged accounts.

owhuys,Scryptiid,"Direction on investment/understanding asset allocation

Hello all. Iâ€™m at a point where I need to start using a taxable account for investment. Itâ€™s probably going to be primarily for retirement purposes alongside my IRA (no 401k offered, no HSA) but the overall goal is just building wealth and letting the money do its thing. I have other savings in place for short term and medium term goals, but being young, I know some things may change. Iâ€™m just putting aside some extra money to start early. 

What Iâ€™m struggling to understand is, if my IRA is invested in a target date index, how does that affect the choices I should make for investing with the taxable account. In general, Iâ€™d like to stay more hands-off so Iâ€™m considering the 3-fund approach, but am starting with smaller amounts invested, and the investment amounts will grow. Do I need to consider the allocation/ratio of both together? Or can I let the target date handle its balance, and just balance the allocation of the 3-fund along the general guidelines as it if it were alone? I havenâ€™t decided on a bond allocation, still reading on that, but if I used the age rule of thumb, it would be 20-25% bonds. 

There is also the suggestion that bonds should be held in a tax advantaged account for efficiency reasons, but my plan was to max the IRA solely investing in the target date. Is that not what I should be doing?

In summary, is it a bad idea/missing something, for me to invest my IRA fully in a target date index, and then have the taxable account (which is basically overflow money) be a 3-fund balance of US stock index, international stock index, and bond index, based on whatever allocation is suggested/decided?

oydg6d,Scryptiid,"Investing with Fidelity: Adding a taxable account to portfolio

Iâ€™d like to preface by thanking the members of this sub for setting me on a strong path going forward. I have significantly more confidence and lack of stress regarding finances, purchasing, and my goals. So thank you you all for your advice, criticism, and suggestions. 

I have both a Roth IRA and taxable account via fidelity. The Roth is new, but I intend on maxing my contribution this year. I do not have a 401k or HSA, nor are they option at this time as far as I am aware. For reference, Iâ€™m currently 23. 

Because of this, the advice has been to use a taxable account for extra money I want to invest. Iâ€™m hesitant to say itâ€™s all for retirement, but I have no specific goals for it right now other than long term wealth generation. Maybe early retirement. I have savings for other goals, as well as an emergency fund, in an HYSA and would balance investing and saving after maxing the IRA each year. 

My IRA is fully being invested in a 2065 target date (FFIJX). I am looking to build a 3-fund for the taxable account. Technically 2 right now, as I donâ€™t feel the need for bonds. Iâ€™m looking at FZROX and FZILX after reading the Bogleheads page. My questions are as follows:

1. They donâ€™t suggest Fidelity Zero in taxable accounts because itâ€™s a taxable event when trying to transfer to another brokerage. How much concern should I have about this? If itâ€™s a large concern, what is my best method of optimizing my investments for tax efficiency?

Edit: After more reading, I understand where, how, and why this could be a potential issue/drawback. However, I am unsure of the best way to work around it and avoid the potential pitfall. Suggestions or insight would be greatly welcomed. 

2. Are there any large merits to taking FSKAX or FTHIX instead? The note I see is that FZILX doesnâ€™t contain international small-cap. Is this reasoning for FTHIX instead? Iâ€™m lost on the subtleties/specifics. 

3. From what I understand, zero funds allow for fractional shares, which might be beneficial, since at times I might be moving smaller amounts into that account. Or is my thinking flawed?

Hello all. Iâ€™m doing some planning for my goals next year, and looking for advice or thoughts on what I should do/learn next given where I am at. 

Iâ€™ve looked through the wiki many times and used it for reference, and as of now, I have a Roth IRA maxed for this year, invested in a target date index fund, and an individual account invested in VTI and VXUS. Iâ€™ve got my emergency fund stashed away, no debts, bills arenâ€™t a concern, no complaints there. Occasionally though, I feel like I donâ€™t know enough or Iâ€™m not doing enough. 

What should I be focusing on next year regarding savings and investing? For me, first step will be maxing the IRA again, but after that, is it a case of taking the recommended 15% for retirement and investing that in the taxable account? 401k isnâ€™t an option through my workplace currently.

23 years old, currently have a Roth IRA fully invested in FFIJX (2065 target date index) and a taxable account invested in VTI + VXUS. The IRA takes priority, and I donâ€™t have a 401k option. The taxable doesnâ€™t have much going in currently, just when I have some extra and the IRA is maxed for the year.

jut4qi,Seethi110,"Am I missing something, or does buying a house seem financially impractical?

The typical rule of thumb I've heard is that you should have 20% down to avoid PMI.  That's about $40,000 cash for a 200k house, and that's a pretty modest sized house in today's market.  I imagine you'd also want a good $10,000 for unexpected repairs, furnishing, appliances etc that you may need in the first year after buying the house.  

So basically I need $50,000 in cash.  Wow.

I currently make about $60,000 a year and am still in the process of paying student loans.  I am on track to have them paid off by mid 2022, and at that point I can start saving for the down payment.  But even with aggressive frugality, it would take about 2.5 years to save up $50,000.  So I'm looking at 4 years from now, and in those 4 years, I can't have any unexpected expenses, I can't contribute my $6,000 to my Roth IRA (or if I did, I'd have to wait even longer for the down payment), and can't make any expensive life choices such as getting married (even if our parents theoretically paid for it, I'd still need money for a ring and other various expenses, at least $5,000 out of my own pocket if I had to guess).

Maybe I'm just discouraged because I have friends who are buying houses now, or because my parents bought a house when they were 23, but it's just weird to think that I would be almost 30 before I could afford even a modest sized house, assuming my finances stay on track with no hiccups.","Status Quo Bias, Social Comparison (related to Herd Behavior), Present Bias","The statement reveals several biases. The individual's consideration of their friends' and parents' home-buying experiences and their apparent discomfort with deviating from this norm suggest a Status Quo Bias, where they feel pressured to follow the traditional path of homeownership.

sbrvto,Seethi110,"Am I correct in thinking that a COLA still leaves you with less take-home money after taxes?

Just to keep things simple, I'm only going to look at federal tax brackets ([https://www.nerdwallet.com/article/taxes/federal-income-tax-brackets](https://www.nerdwallet.com/article/taxes/federal-income-tax-brackets)):

Ok, suppose you currently make $70,000 per year, and suppose inflation is exactly 3%, and your employer gives you a 3% raise to compensate for that

Year 1: you make $70,000 gross and pay $11,148.50 in taxes giving you **$58,851.50** after taxes (with 22% being your highest tax bracket)

Year 2: you now make $70,000 x 1.03 = $72,100 and you now pay $11,148.50 + $2,100(0.22) in taxes leaving you with **60,489.50**

So your real Year 2 take home pay in Year 1 dollars is $60,489.50/1.03 = **$58,727.70,** which is slightly less than you made last year.

Or to look at it more simply, the raise you receive will always be taxed at your highest bracket, so you only actually see 78% of your raise (in this example).  So in order to truly be protected from inflation, your employer should give you current annual inflation x (1 + top tax bracket), or 3.66% in this example.

So if my math is all correct, even a cost of living adjustment tied for inflation leaves you with less real money to spend.","Loss Aversion, Framing Effect, Mental Accounting","The statement exhibits Loss Aversion as the author emphasizes that a Cost of Living Adjustment (COLA) leaves you with ""less take-home money after taxes"" and ""less real money to spend"", highlighting the negative outcome.
