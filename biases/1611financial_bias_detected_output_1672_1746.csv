I am not the sharpest tool in the shed and my face kind of gives it away. I don't know if it's my negative view of myself, or the world, or maybe I'm right, in thinking that when a sales man sees someone that doesn't come across as a very sharp, they are much less likely to negotiate as low as they can truly go. That's just my intuition. So I'm wondering if negotiating via email will get me farther. Or if negotiating via email can get you farther in general as long as you know what is reasonable and doable.

The user's negative self-perception (""I'm not the sharpest tool in the shed"") and concern that the salesman will take advantage of them due to their appearance suggests Loss Aversion, as they are worried about potential losses in the negotiation. The user's attribution of their potential disadvantage to their own perceived lack of sharpness (""my face kind of gives it away"") and their intuition about the salesman's behavior indicates Self-Attribution Bias, where they are attributing their potential outcomes to their own characteristics.

Many people recommend requesting the invoice price when negotiating. Saying things like ""I want to negotiate a price fair for both of us.""

The writer's skepticism towards car salesmen and their perceived capability to ""flat out lie"" or provide a ""lemon"" indicates an Affect Heuristic bias, where emotions (in this case, distrust) are influencing their decision-making process. Additionally, the writer's questioning of the authenticity of the invoice and the ease of manipulation suggests an Overconfidence bias, as they seem to assume that car salesmen are likely to deceive and that they themselves are capable of detecting such deception. Furthermore, the writer's rhetorical questioning of the invoice's authenticity implies a Sunk Cost Fallacy, as they seem to be mentally preparing to justify potential losses or difficulties in obtaining a fair deal.","The user exhibits a tendency to make decisions based on emotions and an inflated sense of their own skepticism, while underestimating the potential for deception and overestimating their ability to detect it."

","Anchoring, Status Quo Bias, Affect Heuristic","The statement reveals several biases. By showing the picture of the 2005 Honda Civics, the individual may be unintentionally anchoring the sales associate's perception of their budget and expectations, potentially limiting their negotiation power.

Additionally, the Sunk Cost Fallacy may be at play, as the sous-chef has already invested time and effort into the restaurant's launch and may feel committed to seeing it through, even if it means continued exploitation. The Affect Heuristic is also likely influencing the sous-chef's decision, as he may be swayed by his emotions and optimism about the restaurant's future success, rather than making a purely rational decision.","The sous-chef is exhibiting a tendency to prioritize short-term gains and emotional appeals over long-term financial stability, leading to potentially exploitative decisions."

My mom is 75. She earns a pension, collects social security, has lifetime health insurance, gets $2000 in rental income, she has very low expenses.

14j0owj,EllieD0113,"How to budget for an unexpected gap in income

I am changing jobs and found out I will have a gap in between paychecks I wasn’t aware of before. My final paycheck will be on June 30th, in the amount of $1701.39. I will not get paid again until August 4th and the amount right now isn’t totally certain (it depends on insurance costs and whether or not I decide to split my paycheck over 10 months or 12), but my total salary is $51,308.

I currently have $938 in the bank. $650 set aside for rent (I split the total cost between two paychecks by putting a chunk of money into a savings account), $174.45 in a savings account for a personal loan I’m paying off (again, I split the total cost between two paychecks), and $114 in checking.

When I get paid on the 30th, I’ll have a grand total of $2,639.39 in the bank. This money will go towards four things, plus food and gas: tithe ($170.13 - this is non-negotiable and advice to “stop tithing” is not advice I need or want), the other portion of rent (~$920), the other half of the loan ($174.45), and my phone bill ($71.02). I also have a final internet bill to pay ($47.91). I will obviously need to buy food (~$40) and gas (~$35) at some point, but trying to stretch this out as far as I can, which should be easy, being a teacher on summer break. So altogether, my expenses will total $2,205, which will leave me about $435 in the bank. This $435 will have to go towards one (or more) other bills when I don’t get paid again on the 15th of July. These are:

- Car Payment: $182.31

- Loan: $174.45

- Apple: $7.55 (music and storage)

- Electric: ~$45

- Chase Bank: $75

- Bank of America: $48

- Car Insurance: $127.62

OR I put this $435 towards part of rent and pull the rest from my August 4th paycheck.

Whatever I don’t spend that $435 on will, unfortunately, have to go on a credit card. I’m working on getting a secondary, WFH job (I cannot teach all day and then go work more - my body can’t physically handle it) to help bring in more money, but in the meantime, what is the best thing to do in this event?

gnniay,EllieD0113,"Pay off credit card debt in chunks, or all at once?

I have two credit cards - one with a balance of $917 and the other, a balance of $6000. I get paid twice monthly, so my mode of operation has been: leftover from 1st of the month goes into savings (~$200), half of the leftover from the 15th of the month goes into savings and the other half gets split in two and pays down the cards. I now have $2k in a separate savings account, which is enough to cover one month’s expenses and then some. Since reaching $2k, I’ve shifted to splitting the leftover money only between the two credit cards.

Using my current budget (which does not account for bonuses or an upcoming pay raise), I’m due to pay off the $917 credit card by August, even with an added ~$40 a month in interest rates and fees. However, looking at my main bank account right now, I realized that what I have in *that* savings + $10 transferred from checking would be enough to pay my credit card in full. Then, starting next month, I could throw all my leftover money from the 15th paycheck at the second credit card (nearly $700 a month), have that paid off by the end of the year or sooner, and still be putting $200+ a month into savings.

- rent: $869.55 (flat every month)

- phone: ~ $140. My sister and I usually split the phone bill, but I’m taking over because she’s struggling financially. I am looking into cheaper options through Verizon because I’m a teacher and they seem to have some good prices.

- electric: $120 per month (I use a pay as you go plan and so far, $30 a week is the usual. Should go down once the temps stop reaching 110 every day.)

- food: ~$200 per month. Recently stopped doing a dinner delivery service because although it significantly cut down on eating out, I do feel like I can still get groceries for cheaper.

- sister’s loan: am also paying $35 for my sister’s student loan.

- misc: $40 per month (shampoo, cat food, etc)

I will also eventually have my other student loan kick in but it’s on grace because of covid. I do also get bonuses of ~$1,000 in December and May.

In all, I’ve got $524 left over each month. If I put $400 towards moving costs each month, I’ll have enough saved up by my projected move date, which leaves $124.

l0l8dg,eng2725,"Traditional or Roth IRA?

Hello, I am 23 right now and make around 67k a year right out of college, with potential for around 2-3 k bonus a year. 

I have about 21k in the bank right now and save around 1600/month, and will go up to around 2300-2400 once my fiancé moves in and splits rent with me in 3 months. She is 23 and makes 72k with 2-3k bonus right out of college as well, but has a good amount of student loans she is paying down. I am potentially looking at buying a house in 8 months with a ~20k down payment, or maybe just renting for a little while longer and help my fiancé pay the debt. So either way I will keep the cash somewhat ready to use in a 6-8 months. 

I want to put my money into an IRA to Atleast get some better returns than my current 0.01% in my savings. I see that if you take out what you put into the account you don’t get penalized or taxed on that, is that true? I want to put the max for this year (6k) in and maybe 6k for last year(I heard you can contribute for the previous year if it’s before April)

Also, which IRA seems right for me?","Present Bias, Framing Effect, Status Quo Bias","The individual in the statement displays Present Bias by prioritizing short-term accessibility of funds, as evident from their plan to keep cash ready for use in 6-8 months and their interest in an IRA that allows penalty-free and tax-free withdrawals of contributions. The Framing Effect is also present, as the individual is drawn to the IRA because of the specific feature that allows tax-free and penalty-free withdrawals of contributions, which is a key aspect of the Roth IRA. Additionally, the individual's reluctance to commit to a specific type of IRA and their desire to maintain liquidity may indicate Status Quo Bias, as they seem hesitant to make a decision that might limit their access to their funds.","The individual exhibits a bias towards short-term thinking and is influenced by the framing of IRA features, while also being hesitant to make a decision that might limit their access to their funds."

Let’s say my gf and I both have 401ks and one works at a very large defense contractor(Lockheed, Raytheon, Harris), and the other works for Pepsi. We are both engineers.

We both right now allocate about 20% of our 401k contributions to our respective company stock. 

Now I know it’s typically not a good idea for you to do that, but I am curious, with our companies being so successful is it still a bad idea. I know nothing is ever certain and the companies could go belly up down the road, but are these safe companies to do this with?","Overconfidence, Anchoring, Status Quo Bias, Confirmation Bias","The statement exhibits several biases. The individual seems to be overconfident in the success of their employers, Lockheed, Raytheon, Harris, and Pepsi, implying that their companies' success makes investing in company stock a relatively safe idea. This overconfidence is evident in the phrase ""with our companies being so successful."" Additionally, the individual appears to be anchored to their current allocation of 20% to company stock, questioning whether it's a bad idea rather than considering a more drastic change. The fact that they mention it's ""typically not a good idea"" but still wonder if it's okay in their case suggests a status quo bias, where they are inclined to maintain their current behavior.

This suggests a Status Quo Bias, as the individual appears to be resistant to changing their current behavior (contributing more to 401k) and instead looks for an alternative.

Background: I am 23 and make around 70k a year and have will have around 30k in my savings account after taxes and the stimmy hit.

401k with 3% match: Contribute 10% to this. Around $7000 a year on my end with current salary.

Roth IRA: max out 6k per year, $500/month. About 11.4% of my take home pay. 

After all of my bills/expenditures and the prior mentioned retirement investing, I still have around $1700 left that is just getting thrown in savings that I would like some help with. I was thinking of maybe throwing 1000/ month (22.8% of take home pay) into an individual brokerage account and raising my 401k contributions to 20% (or 14k per year). This still leaves me with like $180 that adds to savings.

What do you guys think?","Loss Aversion, Overconfidence, Present Bias","The individual in the statement appears to be exhibiting Loss Aversion as they are hesitant to allocate their excess $1700 into an individual brokerage account, possibly due to a fear of losing money. Additionally, their plan to contribute 22.8% of their take-home pay into an individual brokerage account and increasing their 401k contributions to 20% may indicate Overconfidence in their ability to manage their finances and invest successfully.

mbstaj,eng2725,"At what point when comparing jobs does a contract position equal a regular salaried employee?

My gf is currently a process engineer with a year of experience. She started at 72 but got promoted to around 81k. She currently doesn’t utilize the health benefits and won’t for two years since she will stay on her parents health insurance till 26. She gets three weeks vacation and a 4% match on 401k. She works on average 50 hours a week, sometimes more at this job. She hates this job and really isn’t doing much engineering, and is looking to move to where I live.(no COL change and she will move in with me to split rent)

She is being considered for a 12 month contract position at a defense company in which the target hourly her recruiter put is 45$ an hour with the cap being 50$ an hour for that position. There is no PTO a and no health benefits(which doesn’t really matter for the time being). She will be a W-2 employee so she won’t be getting super taxed as if she was a self contractor. If you say she will take 3 weeks vacay per year and you multiply out 40 hr work weeks the new “salary” is around 87k. As far as I know she won’t be able to contribute to a 401k. 

So at what point does a contract position become worth it???","Anchoring, Mental Accounting, Present Bias","The statement exhibits several biases. The individual anchors on the current salary of $81k and the benefits associated with the regular salaried employee position, which creates an emotional attachment to the current job. When evaluating the contract position, they attempt to mentally account for the missing benefits, such as PTO and 401k, by making assumptions (e.g., 3 weeks of vacation) and adjusting the hourly rate accordingly. This mental math exercise reveals a present bias, as the individual prioritizes short-term gains and flexibility over potential long-term benefits. The comparison of the contract position to the current job also implies a status quo bias, but it is not explicitly listed; however, the present bias and mental accounting are more directly supported.","The user exhibits a tendency to make biased financial decisions by anchoring on current values, mentally accounting for missing benefits, and prioritizing short-term gains."
