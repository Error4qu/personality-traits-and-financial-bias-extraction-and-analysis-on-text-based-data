10z3va4,_Raspootin_,"Cash being held in an ATM.

The other day I deposited close to $500 in cash into my credit union's ATM and noticed the available balance was lower than my deposit.

Apparently my Credit Union has a policy that only the first $225 deposited into an ATM is available and the rest has a two business day hold to ""verify the funds"".

Which I could totally understand if this was a check. But what is there to ""verify"" with cash? Their ATM cash counter has counterfeit detection.

Oddly I can't find any bank with similar policies. But noticed almost ALL the local credit unions in my area have the same policy.","Status Quo Bias, Authority Bias","The statement reveals a critical thinking approach that questions the policy of the credit union, particularly the two-business-day hold on cash deposits. However, the writer seems to accept the general practices of credit unions without scrutiny, as evidenced by the statement ""But noticed almost ALL the local credit unions in my area have the same policy."" This suggests a Status Quo Bias, where the writer implicitly accepts the common practice among credit unions as valid or normal. Additionally, there is an underlying Authority Bias, as the writer does not challenge the policy's rationale but instead focuses on the seeming arbitrariness of the policy, implying a deference to the institution's authority.","The user tends to accept common practices within a specific group or institution as valid, while questioning similar policies from other entities, indicating a presence of Status Quo Bias and Authority Bias."

The Affect Heuristic is present as the individual's emotional response to the situation (frustration and anger) seems to be influencing their judgment and decision-making. The person is also displaying Confirmation Bias by selectively focusing on information that supports their initial negative opinion of Amex Checking (""Amex Checking is terrible"") and dismissing alternative explanations.

This suggests the presence of Confirmation Bias, as the individual seeks validation from experiences that align with their concerns about the company's ability to handle claims. Additionally, the emphasis on experiences with claims implies that the individual is influenced by emotions associated with positive or negative outcomes, characteristic of the Affect Heuristic, where the advice sought is likely to evoke a stronger emotional response.","The user exhibits a bias towards seeking validation and emotionally resonant advice, selectively favoring information from individuals with relevant, experiential knowledge."

There is also ""root"" which quoted me $145 for the first month.","Anchoring, Framing Effect, Present Bias","The statement exhibits several biases. The individual is comparing insurance quotes from different companies, and the prices mentioned ($300/mo for Geico, $180/mo for The General, and $145 for Root) serve as anchors, influencing their perception of what is a reasonable price for insurance, which is an example of Anchoring. Additionally, the framing of Geico's quote as ""$300/mo"" (emphasizing the high cost) and The General's quote as ""$180 a month"" (framing it as a relatively more affordable option) demonstrates the Framing Effect.

enj9y7,_Raspootin_,"Carrying a balance makes your money work...for someone else.

I have always been a big believer in making money work for you.

But when you carry a balance, unless it's at 0% terms, you are not making your money work for you, you are making it work for someone else.

Americans average about $6,000 in debt. Even on a decent card with a decent APR, say 12 percent, you are still paying over $500 a year in interest (this assumes you make monthly minimum payments).

I have often seen the advice giving of saving money and investing, but often, it never talks about NOT doing this if you have credit card debt.

Even in a miracle of a fund that earns 12% (totally hypothetical), with $6k invested, you aren't even earning any money, because your basically paying the same in negative interest as you are positive interest.

Now, it doesn't hurt to have a little in savings to cover an emergency, but don't go building a big nest egg of savings and other investments if you carry a balance.

The author's emphasis on paying off credit card debt before saving or investing suggests a loss aversion bias, as they prioritize avoiding losses (interest payments) over potential gains (investment returns). The framing of carrying a balance as making money work ""for someone else"" is a negative framing effect, which can lead to a more conservative and debt-averse attitude. Additionally, the author exhibits mental accounting by separating their money into distinct accounts (debt repayment, savings, and investments), and prioritizing debt repayment over other goals.","The user exhibits a cautious and debt-averse approach to financial decision-making, prioritizing loss avoidance and debt repayment over potential gains, reflecting a combination of loss aversion, framing effect, and mental accounting biases."
esftp3,_Raspootin_,"No one is taking responsibility for an original credit account.

I am working diligently on rebuilding my credit. 

I have a $2,013 charge off on my reports from a Helzberg Diamonds store credit card from a year ago.

The name listed on my reports is ""The Bank of Missouri Retail"".

The address and phone number listed is for ""Genesis FS Card Services"".

A month or so ago, my balance went to zero. I was told ""incorrectly"", that my balance was sold to a collection agency. However, no name was listed, no contact details, anything.

So I call back and speak to a manager and was told ""We (Genesis FS) purchased it from The Bank of Missouri"". Ok..can I settle? ""Nope, pay the full balance"" (or eat shit I guess).

Genesis is the issuer of the Helzberg Diamonds Card. TBOM only lends them the money to do so.3

That seemed a little weird. I've never heard of a card issuer purchasing an account from a bank. Collection agency, sure.

SO I reached out to the Bank of Missouri and the MANAGER of the retail credit division told me Genesis is full of shit. TBOM is only a LENDER. They do not issue credit accounts on behalf of Helzberg Diamonds. They do not handle HBD credit accounts. They do not report on behalf of them either. Helzberg Diamonds has been reporting the account with their address and phone number, but sticking ""The Bank of Missouri"" on the reporting to pass the buck, I guess. 

I called Genesis back and asked when it would be sold to a collection agency. I was told straight up ""we don't know, could take a week, could take three years"".

Loss Aversion is evident as they are hesitant to pay the full balance of the charge-off and instead are trying to negotiate a settlement, indicating a reluctance to accept a loss. The Framing Effect is also present, as the individual's perception of the situation is influenced by the way information is presented to them, such as the revelation that Genesis FS ""purchased"" the account from The Bank of Missouri, which seems unusual to them. Regret Aversion is likely driving their decision not to pay the full balance, as they are trying to avoid the potential regret of paying a large sum of money. Additionally, the Sunk Cost Fallacy is present, as the individual is not considering the ""sunk cost"" of the $2,013 charge-off and is instead focusing on trying to minimize their losses.","The individual exhibits a tendency to make financially conservative decisions driven by a desire to avoid losses and minimize regret, often influenced by the framing of information and past sunk costs."

The use of the phrase ""my Fico score tanked30 points"" and the exclamation ""Why?"" suggests an emotional response to the recent event. Additionally, the Affect Heuristic is present, as the person's emotional reaction to the score drop is driving their decision-making and interpretation of the situation.

gy4zjh,_Raspootin_,"Probably going to be renting for a while.

Was all set to buy a house this year, the lending restrictions are too tight, and honestly I don't think now is the right time to buy. I personally think homes will fall in value as evictions rise due to Covid-19 and more elderly people (many homeowners are 60+) are moving into retirement homes or moving to FL/AZ.

I talked to a few mortgage lenders and the hoops one has to jump through to buy is insane in the post 2008 economy. 

For starters, apparently most banks won't lend you money unless you work full time. I have too many medical issues to work full time, none of which are considered a disability, but are debilitating.

rgkz4g,99JustAsIAm,"Give me 2 good reasons why I shouldn't rollover my Traditional IRA to my new Fidelity 401K....

Long story short

I lost my job Nov 2020. I rolled my 401K and pension into a Traditional IRA with Morgan Stanley. I have not contributed additional funds.

6 months later I started a new job. 6 months after that my employer started offering a Fidelity 401K with 50% match up to 6%.

The caveat? Family connection has me paying 0.08% on the Morgan Stanley Traditional IRA. I have no idea what fees I'd encounter with Fidelity 401K.

Backstory:

I have been investing a total of ~25% of my net income the past few years in both retirement accounts and taxable accounts. l invest into a total market fund. Iâ€™m in my early 30s. 

I have also have been able to save to roughly $100,000 in a high yield savings account. I have been able reach $100k in cash because Iâ€™ve only been investing 25% of my income and my expenses were low when I was younger. (All other income not spent went to savings). 

Going forward I have 3 ideas:

1. Continue to invest 25%, and let my cash level increase past $100k (if I can save beyond the 25%). 

2. Forget the 25% idea and invest everything beyond my emergency fund (leaving roughly $30,000 in cash). 

3. Keep $100,000 as a combination of an emergency fund, all future *possible* expenses/properties, engagement, vacations, cash allocation for investments, and fun money. Then invest everything beyond that number in equities. (Which would likely mean investing far higher than 25% of my income). 

My hesitation with doing option 2 is that what if I want to buy another house? What if I need the money for a wedding? Starting a side business? I donâ€™t know when or if those things will happen, but they could happen sooner than laterâ€¦

Side note/extra details:

I also currently have a mortgage for $200k @3.5%. I am unsure how long I will stay at my current residence, and may choose to upgrade to another property at some point in the future (not sure when that would be). I may rent out my current property. 

If I stick to the 25% investment rate and high savings rate (hopefully)â€¦option 1â€¦I should be able to get to that $200k figure in savings in under 5 years, while having a similar amount invested.

Iâ€™m 30 years old, and live in a condo. Ideally I would eventually like to live in a house, but that wouldnâ€™t be for at least another 3-5 years. At that time, I could either keep the condo and rent it out, or sell it and use the equity. I may also end up staying much longer. It will all depend where my life is when I cross that bridge. 

I owe a bit over $200,000 on the condo at a 3.25% interest and have roughly $100,000 in my high yield savings account. I also have another $12,000 in a taxable account in index funds, and maxed out retirement accounts. 

So, my question isâ€¦ I can save roughly $2,500 on average a month. What should I do with this money? 

My ideas are:

1. Throw every extra dollar over the $100,000 emergency/savings fund into index funds

2. Throw every extra dollar into the high yield savings account until it reaches $200,000. This would be about the amount needed to pay off the condo (if I wanted to). It would roughly take 2.5-4 years (maybe less or more depending on spending and income). Once I got to the $200,000 in the HYSA, I would put the rest/overflow in index funds and have peace of mind knowing I could technically pay the house off at any time, while still having the flexibility and liquidity of it in a savings account paying a higher rate. This would also enable me to invest more comfortably beyond this amount in my taxable account.

Iâ€™m looking to likely be able to save/add an additional $30,000 in 2024 the HYSA. 

Is there anything you would change? Where would you go next? 
My living plans are kind of up in the air right now. Iâ€™m content (for now) with where Iâ€™m livingâ€¦ but who knows, I may move to a different home in a few years. I may start a familyâ€¦ canâ€™t rule anything out right? 

A part of me wants to add $90,000 additionally in the taxable account, into the S&P 500, but I know I would be slightly uneasy having that much in. I donâ€™t want to be exposed enough to get my emotions involved. But I do know how much that extra $90,000 could compound to in 30 years. 

A part of me also wants to stack more cash to pay off the town home (or at least have the ability to with cash on the sidelines paying higher rate than the mortgage). 

But in reality, my plan going forward is to do a combination of both, keeping the current allocations above the same, and investing 20% of my income going forward. If Iâ€™m able to bring my cash reserves even higher than they are now while doing so, great, but I will at least know Iâ€™m still putting 20% away for retirement.

Overconfidence is present as they seem to have a good grasp of their financial situation but are seeking validation from others.

I have been investing 20% across retirement accounts as well as taxable accounts for a few years now. I have also been able to save $100,000 in a high yield savings account while doing so. 

Many people are telling me to invest a chunk of the $100,000 emergency savings/future real estate money into the markets.

Iâ€™m not a fan of the HOA here, and I only have one form of heating, which is tedious to run and bothers my eyes (wood stove). I feel like long term I wonâ€™t be most happy here, but I have a pretty great mortgage rate and other than the heating woes itâ€™s a good spot. 

Iâ€™m torn as to what to do next. Realistically, Iâ€™d like to try and make it to 2026 here to get the full 5 years out of the place. Some days I think, eh, Iâ€™m done I want out nowâ€¦ but to make things worth my purchase, I should try and hit that 5 year mark. 

As for the money I have now, I plan on investing $70k of the $100k in the S&P 500 over the next 6 months, bringing liquid cash down to $30k. I should be able to save $30k a year going forward, which would put me back to $100k by the end of 2026.

I'm mostly stress typing here and not necessarily looking for advice, but it helps with my anxiety.

I know it's not \*that much\* (in both cases) but I have to admit I had a little cry over it just now. I just got word that when renewing my lease in March, my new rent will be rising $75 from 1450 to $1525. When I moved into the unit it was only $1395 because of the pandemic. 

I live in a studio in DC on $54,600 pre-tax so I'm definitely cutting it close to my limit. But I'm about to sell my car (for parts - the estimate is around $400 but I'm sure it will be lower than that) so that will eliminate my AAA and car insurance (around $65 total), and I got rid of Netflix and Discovery Plus. Those pretty simple choices will already make up for that monthly $75 loss.

Between what's in my checking right now and savings, I have just over $7,100 and I have about $21k in my 401k. No credit card debt (I use my Chase Sapphire for nearly everything) and about $21k in student loans.

I'm 30 so I know that's not that good but I'm just laying it out there.

I recently spent $1500 at the vet but I have insurance and should get $900 back (it's 90% coverage + $500 deductible) so that helps.

Hi all,  
I (30, F, living in Washington DC) realize that I've been overspending lately. I don't have any credit card debt, but after paying for rent this month, I'll only have $878 in my checking account before any other bills. I have about $4,800 in savings. I make about $1720 on the 31st/15th after taxes.  
While this number is certainly better than where I've been in the past, my standards for financial stability have also changed. I make a meager income for the area - mid 50s working for a nonprofit.  
My thing is - when I notice that I'm overspending, I tend to get very anxious and start panicking. But I don't really adjust my habits to the financial reality I'm in. I'm lucky and haven't yet held a balance on my card, I use it like a debit card and pay if off in full every few days.  
Luckily I got rid of my car so I got to cancel my car insurance. I am also not going to renew my $80 gym membership when it expires in July. It's only $80 but at least that will create some wiggle room.  
Also the planet fitness i got like 7 years ago and it's impossible to cancel it which is exactly what they want lol.  
I am willing to splurge on rent to live alone in a nice, comfortable safe apartment in a neighborhood I love. I understand the 30% rule and obviously that is ideal, but in DC in particular you sometimes have to make deals with the devil. I initially got the apartment as a pandemic deal at $1395. After the pandemic order was lifted, my rent increased. I'm lucky that I only pay what I do.  
The spending below is just my recurring expenses - god knows I'm an impulse spender. The grocery budget also is a bit flexible since I often don't spend $100 weekly.That's just my goal limit.

I think it's the dumb stuff like going to starbucks or dunkin or realllly splurging on the weekends on clothes or something that hinders me.

I think I posted in this group that I recently received a bonus at work. That brings me to (at the moment) $6,000 in savings and $2k ish in checking (recently was traveling and not all of the things have posted on my card yet but I pay my card daily as things become available.) I live in a high COL area (DC).

I made the decision to save most of my bonus and then make one bigger purchase with it. After taxes the bonus was $2280. I want to buy an erg/rowing machine. I'm a rower and I've been using the erg off and on since high school (I'm 31) and I always knew that if I were to ever buy a piece of equipment it would be that.

I'm confident in my decision to buy an erg, but I am having a very hard time making the leap and purchasing it. It's about $900 for the model I want/fits my needs. It's the model I've always used and I want to set myself up for success by not having to learn a whole new model. Concept 2 is also the standard erg for rowers, unlike some cheaper, lower quality machines.

The only debt I have is student loan debt around $21k. The rest of the bonus went to my emergency fund. I see spending the money on it as an investment because I know I'll use it and in the long run it's way cheaper than a gym membership. 

Things are pretty stable right now with the exception of student loans restarting - which will run about $180 a month. I have a pet, but I have pet insurance included in my budget which covers 90% of care she'd need, and so on.

I recently got a mid/3rd quarter bonus. I work at a nonprofit and make about **$55k a year** (before taxes) in DC. A midyear/not end-of-year bonus is new to me. I'm in my 2nd year at this company and from what I understand, year-end bonuses are somewhat expected.

I wanted to use this bonus to put most away and use part of it for fun. I have **$2840 in checking** and **$6075 in savings**. (and around $300 in credit card charges that are pending but I pay off daily as they roll in, so see it as $2500 in checking). 

I really want to buy a Concept 2 erg. For context, I row as a hobby. Granted I'm not a competitive rower or anything, but I know how the erg works and it's my preferred workout. Buying one would not be an impulse. I'm 31 and rowed in high school as well as this year and it's the only workout equipment I feel confident using. I recently did not renew my gym membership because it was $90 a month. I also recently lost a ton of weight and since I stopped rowing on the water bc the season ended, I've gained 4 pounds. I want to buy the erg to invest in my health. the Erg after taxes and shipping and stuff is **$11000.**

Below is my tentative budget. Please keep in mind that my utilities vary and are unlikely that high each month. this month they were around $36. I also don't often spend $100 on groceries weekly, but I do allot that much.

Also, this budget operates as if I had $0 in checking before the paychecks and was only operating on the $1720 deposited twice a month. 

Another caveat, the cat food is usually not spent each month. It seems like more of an every-other month type deal. But when doing this budget, I wanted to err on the side of including too much in the calculations rather than unexpected expenses.

Lastly (hopefully) I did add in netflix recently. I'm debating what streaming service to get rid of for now. I think this will likely be HBO as the shows I watch are not out rn. But let's be real I might just keep them both.

TLDR, can I get permission to get the erg lol? Can I? Can I?

I messed up my rollover my putting the wrong thing for the FBO. I was an idiot and put my old company - so the checks I got were made to my old company.

Additionally - I am such an idiot because I did not realize that you can't rollover a Roth into my new company's 401k. So now I'm screwed because I included my Roth in the rollover.

The savings I had in my previous work retirement account has now been withdrawn from that account, but has not yet been deposited into the new one. I've basically been back and forth with both companies for a month and it still has not been figured out.

My old retirement account company said I needed to fill out a correction form - so I did and I sent it to my old company because I need their signature. It's been weeks and they haven't gotten back to me but it looks like that might be done soon.

I consider myself financially intelligent - I have a nonprofit salary so it's not like I have much to work with, but I have some knowledge in the area of finance.

But I swear to god rollovers just break me. I am really stressed about a potential tax penalty and I just want it all to be fixed, and I honestly have no idea what to do at this point.

If anyone has a word of advice I'd be grateful.

I (30/F) have about $5k in savings right now - the most i've ever had...much of it was from luck after getting a high tax refund and a vacation payout from my old job when i left. 

Needless to say I am working to establish that emergency fund.

However - there is a trip I want to take next year in the San Juan Islands, Washington, and the location sells out very very fast. 

I'm thinking about ""loaning"" myself the money to set up the initial reservations that are refundable if shit hits the fan (up until a certain amount of time before the trip). 

The two big chunks I'm tempted to tackle now are for a very specific excursion that will sell out fast - that is $300. It's a multi-hour wildlife viewing trip and it would be \*why\* I'm taking the vacation.

The second is the hotel for part of the trip. I want to get that down especially because things are already starting to sell out - the hotel is relatively affordable for the area so it's bound to sell out asap

All in all that big first payment would be more or less around $600 depending on taxes and such. 

In all likelihood i will be able to pay for my flight with points and then stagger the rest of the trip details throughout the year. 

I'd still have around $4,500 in my savings.

Hi! 

Can you give me some advice on how youâ€™d approach my situation? Im 30 years old, no kids, not married, with no credit card debt and I only have a 401k currently (contributing at 10% and get the company match of 3%). I want to build my wealth, be financially independent, be able to set myself up to retire but also have money to travel and enjoy life. 

People have said I should open a Roth IRA but that I make too much-Whatâ€™s a back door IRA and how do I got about doing that? 

I know I should get a high interest rate savings account, any suggestions on good ones? 

What should I do after that point? Should I get Robinhood app and invest? 

My family was poor growing up so I never had anyone to tell me how to manage money and I get nervous touching my checking account (thatâ€™s just because Iâ€™ve never had that much cash before) but I know that money is wasting away due to inflation and I want to make smart money moves. Would appreciate any advice on what moves I should make!

Hey everyone,

I recently got married in September of 2022 and my wife are figuring out what to do about taxes. We do have a tax guy but just curious what your thoughts are:

I roughly make 95k + productivity bonus per year which is usually 20-30k paid quarterly( 6-7k per quarter). It fluctuates but my take home pay every two weeks is 95k gross.

I have 128k from grad school in debt with a minimum payment of 1600 at 2.8% private (refinanced in 2020). I am happy with this and it is manageable from an income standpoint.

My wife makes roughly 60k gross with 48k in private loans. Her dad was the co-signer and has been paying these up until now. $600 min payment with variable rates (working on getting refinanced) but we are taking these over. Again, this is manageable.

My wife also has 27k in defaulted loans that we didnâ€™t know about (I know I know) and I am enrolling her in the fresh start program which brings them out of default and back into normal federal loans. We have until June when the pause is supposed to end to figure out payment plan. Iâ€™m not too worried about it but just some questions.

1. Would it be more beneficial to file separate or joint in terms of all things considered above? Or does it all depend on other tax liabilities?

2. If we file joint then I am just afraid that her 27k new payment will be based on both incomes and a lot higher, so is that just something my tax guy can help me with?

16oheyb,agjjnf222,"How do I help my wife from overspending? Details below.

My wife and I have been married for over a year. We have a great relationship and I believe that our financial goals are aligned most of the time. The main point of this is to ask for advice not from a money stand point but just a mentality perspective.

We both make good money and are able to save and travel and do things we want to. We have a good amount of student loan debt but expected to pay off in 3-4 years. Iâ€™m not going to get into the weeds if our expenses as that isnâ€™t really the problem.

6 months into marriage my wife and I made the decision that for her â€œfun moneyâ€ she will get $250 every other week. I would say 95% of the time this works really well. I budget everything so it allows her to basically buy whatever she wants with that money. I also make sure credit cards are paid off.

I think the problem stems from us having different mentalities about money as well as different expectations.

I live more frugally and would like to just sacrifice the next couple years and pay off debt then be good. She is more care free and sees it as we will eventually pay them off but we still have to enjoy our life now. We have to find a middle ground.

Here are some scenarios that seem to have happened lately:

1. I told my wife two nights ago she had $20 left in her fund. Yesterday she buys a $50 item therefore going over her fund. She said itâ€™s fine because I get more tomorrow. Now Iâ€™m not worried about the money but that type of thinking is how people get into cc debt by spending money you donâ€™t have. Difference in mentality.

2. I get paid quarterly bonuses about 8-12k and have one in October. She also has a side gig through fall that can net her 7-8k. We owe 16k on her car at $350 a month which is fine but I see it as we could combine our bonuses to knock it out and have left over. She sees this as a house fund for her to continue to decorate and do things for the house. Again, difference of opinion on what to do with that money. 

3. She wants me to handle everything when it comes to paying bills, paying ccs, talking to our FA but she gets annoyed when I ask her about charges. â€œHey is this a house item or a fund item?â€ And the usual response is something like â€œIâ€™m not going to live forever with you breathing down my neck.â€ Now again I donâ€™t care what her fund is used for. It was a mutual discussion and agreement we had but in order to track said fund then I have to know what the fund purchases are. She said she keeps up with it but again see number 1.

Overall, I just feel alone in the journey to financial freedom. We make great money, we travel, we do things that we want. We donâ€™t have any credit card debt so itâ€™s not a money problem. I just see it as her not letting go of her single life where she could do whatever she wanted with her money. Itâ€™s always a battle when it comes to spending. I donâ€™t care about $50 purchases. I do care that there seem to be a blurred definition of needs and wants. Instead of taking 5k to spend on house decor and furniture, why isnâ€™t the obvious choice to pay off her car therefore freeing up $350 a month in income? 

Why is it that my bonuses are the ones going to our debt and she can use hers for the house? Sure I like having nice things in our house but I also like freeing up income by knocking out debt.

 - use bonus in October to pay the two 6.8% loans in her private loans which makes up almost 1/3 of that total. We did a lower payment plan if we want to put extra money towards it a month.

Hey everyone,

I am someone who has an FA and I couldnâ€™t be happier. We do quarterly meetings to check in and strategize how to take care of debt and retirement.

Reasons why I decided to get an FA:

- I work in medicine so I have a high earning potential

- I enjoy finances but I didnâ€™t want to be completely in charge

- it has saved me an incredible amount of stress and headaches knowing that I have someone who lives and breathes this stuff. My FA has a masters in applied economics (I know this doesnâ€™t really matter but he knows his stuff)

Now on to the point of this post:

I am 31 and currently have 190k in student and car loans between my wife and I. Household income of 170k roughly and I also receive about 50k in bonuses a year.

Seeing that debt number has always scared me but it scares me less knowing that I have a plan.

The problem I always had was do I put more to debt or savings or both? How the hell do I get on top of this?

In comes my FA. We sit down quarterly to talk debt strategy, retirement, and overall how the market is doing. I am naturally an anxious person so these meetings really help me put things into perspective. 

Last night, he told me that I am in good shape and actually contributing a good amount to retirement despite me thinking otherwise. It was this small statement that made me realize â€œoh everything is going to be fine.â€

I wouldnâ€™t call this a light bulb moment but damn near close to one. Being able to have this conversation with someone who handles other clients and knows his stuff gives me a little encouragement in knowing that Iâ€™m on the right track.

Hello!

My wife and I are both 30 years old and will be trying to have a kid soon so we are just figuring out which insurance plan sounds like the best option for us.

I am on my wifeâ€™s insurance as she works for a bigger corporation and they offer two options so any advice would be helpful as we prepare for kids in the next year or two (however long it takes). We are both fairly healthy and donâ€™t take medications. 

Option 1: PPO for family

- deductible: $3k

- out of pocket max: $9k

- coinsurance: 80%/20%

- emergency room: $300 copay + 20%

- telemedicine/urgent care/PCP: $20 copay

- prescription retail: $10/$35/$75/25% coinsurance/$350 maximum

- Per paycheck: $207

Option 2: HSA

- deductible: $6k

- out of pocket max: $10k

-coinsurance: 80%/20%

- everything else: deductible coinsurance

- per paycheck: $158

So I know that an HSA is a great retirement savings but in out situation of being pretty healthy, no medications, and about to start a family what would be the better option?

Thanks!","Status Quo Bias, Present Bias, Framing Effect","The individual is seeking advice on choosing an insurance plan, and in their message, they seem to be leaning towards the default or current option, which might be the PPO plan through his wife's employer, as they mention being on her insurance plan.

My monthly student loan payment is $260 and I carry no other debt, other than a credit card I pay off weekly to bi-weekly (depending on balance) and I do not carry a balance month to month.

I have the following liquid savings:

$15,500 between two savings accounts

$1,700 between two checking accounts

$4,000 dedicated emergency fund including a $1,000 buffer in a supplement savings account I use as a â€œbankâ€ for CC purchase money

$1,700 in specialized savings (Holiday Club and a car sinking fund)

$3,000 for a home down payment (slowly increasing)

$2,500 for student loan repayment

$3,500 in a Robinhood brokerage account

**Total Saved: ~$30,000**

I have the following illiquid savings:

$65,000 in employer 401k

$2,000 personal IRA

**Total Retirement: $67,000**

If I pay off my student loans today, I will have $13,000 left, excluding my Robinhood account. Based off my current estimates, come August, if I pay them off at this point, I will have $16,000 in savings, plus my Robinhood account.

Is it a smart idea to pay off my loans come August? Especially since I would like to buy a house in a year and a half or so? I feel like it is and I will still have some buffer if an emergency does happen, but a small part of me is hesitant.","Status Quo Bias, Present Bias, Mental Accounting","The individual is hesitant to pay off their student loans, despite having a significant amount of savings and a clear plan for future financial goals, such as buying a house. This hesitation suggests a Status Quo Bias, where the individual is inclined to maintain their current situation, in this case, continuing to make monthly payments rather than paying off the loan in full. Additionally, the individual's consideration of their current financial situation and future goals, but still being hesitant, indicates a Present Bias, where they are prioritizing short-term financial security over long-term benefits. Furthermore, the individual's separate allocation of funds into various accounts, such as a dedicated emergency fund, home down payment fund, and student loan repayment fund, suggests Mental Accounting, where they are treating different types of money differently, potentially leading to suboptimal financial decisions.","The individual exhibits a tendency to prioritize maintaining their current financial situation, prioritize short-term security, and mentally compartmentalize their funds, leading to a cautious approach to paying off their student loans."

I have roughly $13.2k left on my student loans and by the time repayment resumes, I will be at $12.9k on them. I can pay them off at that point, but it will involve two different bank accounts held at two separate credit unions. One will come from my current bank and will be roughly $4.2k of it and the balance of $8.7k will be from my other account.

I moved a few years ago and I opened a new account at a local credit union about 8 months ago. I still have my old credit union account open but I have not had the ability to close it yet due to distance and the fact I need both my parents present to close it. I also have an IRA currently locked in a bond until September.

Do I need to notify the IRS?","Loss Aversion, Regret Aversion, Affect Heuristic","The individual is hesitant to pay off their student loans from multiple accounts due to concerns about the appearance of structuring, which may indicate a loss aversion bias, as they are worried about potential penalties and consequences. Additionally, their concern about being investigated by the IRS and desire to avoid any appearance of wrongdoing suggests regret aversion, as they are trying to avoid potential regret. The individual's emotional response to the situation, specifically their dismissal of the potential investigation (""I frankly don't care if the IRS wants to investigate it, I have nothing to hide""), followed by a clear concern about it, also hints at the affect heuristic, where their emotional response is influencing their decision-making.","The user exhibits a cautious and risk-averse approach to financial decision-making, driven by concerns about potential losses and regret."

SoI am curious: would this basically be a replacement for travelers insurance?","Framing Effect, Mental Accounting","The statement exhibits a Framing Effect, as the individual is influenced by the way the insurance provider presents the umbrella insurance option, highlighting its coverage of claims that exceed existing insurance policies and including unique scenarios like libel or travel damage. This framing makes the insurance seem more valuable than it might be if presented in a more neutral or comprehensive manner. Additionally, Mental Accounting is present, as the individual considers umbrella insurance as a potential replacement for travelers insurance, indicating a tendency to categorize and evaluate different types of insurance as separate accounts rather than considering their overall financial situation and insurance needs.","The user tends to be influenced by the way information is presented and compartmentalizes different insurance products, rather than evaluating them based on a comprehensive understanding of their financial situation."

Additionally, the individual appears to be anchored on the idea that increasing the credit limit would have an impact on utilization, which might not necessarily be the case if the goal is to maintain a 0% utilization rate by paying off the balance in full each month. The question itself betrays an incomplete understanding of how credit utilization is calculated and how credit limit increases affect it.","The user exhibits a tendency to seek confirmation of their preconceived notions and relies on initial, potentially incorrect assumptions when evaluating financial decisions."

Additionally, the Framing Effect is present as the person frames having multiple credit cards as a negative, focusing on the potential slowing of reward accumulation, rather than objectively evaluating the benefits and drawbacks of using multiple cards.","The user exhibits a tendency to mentally compartmentalize financial information and frame decisions based on superficial aspects, leading to a potentially biased evaluation of credit card usage."

Recency Bias is also present, as the person is overemphasizing the recent change in their credit score and utilization rate, possibly due to its vividness and recency. Additionally, the Affect Heuristic is evident, as the individual's emotional response to the decrease in credit score (affect) is influencing their perception of the situation, leading them to question the commonality of such a score change.","The user exhibits a loss-averse and recency-biased mindset, with a tendency to make judgments based on emotional responses to recent changes in their financial situation."

This suggests a Status Quo Bias, as they seem to be sticking with the current situation (leaving the Traditional IRA at the credit union) due to inertia or a reluctance to change. Additionally, the user's consideration of rolling over the Traditional IRA to a Vanguard Roth IRA, but not taking immediate action, may indicate a Present Bias, where they are prioritizing short-term convenience over long-term benefits.","The user exhibits a tendency to stick with the current situation and delay taking action towards a potentially more beneficial outcome, indicating biases towards maintaining the status quo and prioritizing short-term convenience."

I am currently looking into a MBA and realistically, the program will cost me between $40k and $100k. I am planning on starting for the fall of 2024. I was originally planning to buy a house and was looking to buy at the beginning of 2025, so I am saving money for a down payment.

However, now I am debating if it makes more sense for me to just pay for my MBA as much as I can, and as I go through the program. Interest rates are pretty high and I think it may make sense to avoid high interest student loans. In theory I would have around $30k saved by the time I would need to pay for the first semester.

But if I pay as I go, it will likely push my home purchase to 2026 or 2027. And it seems like the housing market will just be getting worse in the future.

What are peopleâ€™s thoughts on this?","Present Bias, Sunk Cost Fallacy, Recency Bias, Affect Heuristic","The individual's decision-making process reveals several biases. Their consideration of paying for the MBA as they go, to avoid high-interest student loans, indicates a Present Bias, as they prioritize short-term savings over long-term goals, such as buying a house. Additionally, their concern about potentially delaying their home purchase to 2026 or 2027 due to paying for the MBA as they go, suggests a Sunk Cost Fallacy, as they are considering investing in the MBA program to avoid future costs, rather than evaluating the opportunity costs of delaying homeownership. The recent mention of high interest rates and the expectation of a worsening housing market may be influencing their decision, reflecting a Recency Bias. Furthermore, their emotional consideration of what ""seems like the housing market will just be getting worse in the future"" and seeking others' thoughts on the matter, indicates an Affect Heuristic, where they are relying on intuition and emotions rather than a thorough analysis.","The individual exhibits a tendency to prioritize short-term gains and avoid immediate costs, while being influenced by recent information and emotions, leading to a potentially suboptimal decision regarding their long-term financial goals."

My spouse and I currently just have a general 1.25% cash back card. Now that we've built up strong credit scores, we're now looking to get some cards with better rewards. This is our current plan:

|Category|Credit card (cash back)|Annual reward cap|
|:-|:-|:-|
|Groceries|Amex Blue Cash Preferred (6%)|$360 (note: $95 fee)|
|Gas and transit|Amex Blue Cash Preferred (3%)|Unlimited|

|Large planned purchases (electronics, furniture, etc.)|US Bank Cash+ (5% on two chosen quarterly categories)|$400|
|Everything else|Citi Double Cash (2%)|Unlimited|

We're going to slowly build up these cards (5 in total) over the course of 2 years. A few important notes:

* We will definitely NOT carry a balance on any cards or spend more than we normally would just to get the rewards.
* All of these except the Amex have no annual fee. We spend a lot on groceries (HCOL area, plus we love to cook and are athletic/eat a lot) so this fee is definitely worth it. All the other fee-charging cards I've checked out were not worth it to us, though I'm open to suggestions.
* It will definitely be a little complex to keep track of which card to use for each purchase, especially with the rotating categories. However my spouse and I enjoy geeking out over this kind of thing so I think it should be fine. Plus, accidentally using a sub-optimal card for a small purchase isn't a big deal.
* We do not expect to actually hit the reward caps for most of the cards, as we aren't huge spenders. Outside of non-CC expenses (for example, rent charges fees to pay with a CC so we don't use them), we only spend about $10k a year.

m5rncu,AlzScience,"The opportunity cost of paying off low-interest debt early

Just a fun thought experiment I calculated today. Spouse and I have a total of $30k in student loans at 4.5% interest (assuming no loan cancellation happens and ignoring the current deferment for calculations sake). We have enough money to pay it off right now, or we could invest that money instead. Which is better?

Option 1: Early payoff. With minimum payments, it would take us around 18.5 years to pay them off, so be paying them off early we save $14k in interest. Sounds great, right?

Option 2: We invest the $30k and make only minimum payments toward the loans, paying them off in 18.5 years. Assuming an average rate of return of 10%, our initial investment would grow to nearly $167k in that time! Thatâ€™s a net profit of over $153k after subtracting loan interest. Of course that money will continue to grow after the 18.5 year period, netting even higher profit. 

This is not to say that paying off low-interest debt is always a bad thing. However itâ€™s important that you consider the opportunity cost when making your decision. A lot of people think about the interest on the loans, but donâ€™t consider the potential market growth. Food for thought! 

Also paying off in full and making minimum payments are not the only options. For example some people may choose to max their tax-advantaged retirement accounts and use only the leftover money for loan payoff. Thereâ€™s no right or wrong answer, just run the numbers and make a decision based on your own goals and risk tolerance!

Edit: Less extreme example for some context. Say we have an extra $200/mo. If we put that toward loans, we are now paying double the minimum. We pay them off in 7.3 years and save $9k in interest. If we invest that money instead, after 7.3 years our profit would only be around $13k on average, though that profit will widen the longer we keep the money invested. Again, both options are solid, so just take the time to run your numbers and make the best decision for you.","Framing Effect, Mental Accounting, Present Bias","The author presents a thought experiment that compares paying off low-interest debt early with investing the money instead. The way the author frames the options influences the reader's perception: Option 1 is framed as ""saving $14k in interest,"" which emphasizes the benefit of debt elimination, while Option 2 is framed as a potential ""net profit of over $153k,"" highlighting the investment's growth. This framing difference can lead readers to prioritize one option over the other based on the author's emphasis. Additionally, the author engages in mental accounting by considering the loan payoff and investment as separate accounts, rather than evaluating the overall financial situation. The author's conclusion, ""just run the numbers and make a decision based on your own goals and risk tolerance,"" suggests a consideration of present values, but the emphasis on potential market growth implies a present bias, prioritizing short-term investment gains over long-term debt repayment.","The author exhibits a tendency to frame financial decisions in a way that influences the reader's perception, while also compartmentalizing financial accounts and prioritizing short-term investment gains over long-term debt repayment."

I understand that a Roth is normally best for low income earners since you can pay your taxes while in a lower bracket. However, does this still apply when you are below the contribution limit? For example, letâ€™s say I have enough extra money to contribute $3000 to an IRA this year. If I go Roth, I pay taxes up front and not in retirement. However, with the traditional I can save myself $360 in taxes. If I then invest tha $360, it can compound over time to potentially be worth more than the tax benefits. Is my thinking correct here?

I'm planning to convert \~$6k in a Trad IRA to a Roth. Our marginal federal tax rate is 12%, so we'll need to pay around $700 in taxes.

menoin,AlzScience,"How much do you REALLY need in emergency savings?

6 months living expenses is the rule of thumb, I'm aware. For my spouse and I that would be around $15k. However, there are a few factors that make me think that we may not need this much:

* My income is extremely stable as I'm funded for the next four years by a government-sponsored research fellowship. We are able live comfortably on my income alone and in fact this is what we do, as my spouse's income all goes toward retirement/loan payoff. We also both have side hustles that we could pretty easily ramp up if needed.
* We are renters in sudsidized university housing, which we can stay in until I finish my PhD (4 years) and has capped rent increases. So no major housing repairs or rent hikes to worry about. They're also pretty flexible about delaying rent payments in an emergency.
* We are well-insured in all areas (health, disability, pet, etc.) Only exception is car insurance where we mostly just have liability coverage, no comprehensive or collision, but that's because our car's super old and not worth much. If our car were to need replaced, our plan would be to finance a ""new"" (3-5 year old) car and cut back our retirement contributions for \~4-6 months to pay it off completely. My spouse could also bike or bus to work for a while if needed (I already bike to work as well).
* We set aside money every month into sinking funds for major planned expenses (car maintenance, insurance premiums, etc.) which is on top of our existing emergency fund.
* Our only debt is federal student loans, which are currently deferred. After September they'll be $200/mo which we can still afford if living on my income alone. The interest rate is quite low so paying minimums for a while is not a big deal.
* We have no plans for children or additional pets (we have one cat).
* We're in our 20s with no known health conditions (plus good insurance through my work with $0 deductible and $5000 out-of-pocket limit, again guaranteed for the next 4 years).
* We have around $50k invested across our 401ks, Roth IRAs, and taxable brokerage (each month we contribute around $1900). If a REALLY big emergency were to arise, we could sell our taxable portfolio (minimal capital gains tax at our current income level), take out a 401k loan, or withdraw IRA contributions.

Based on the above, it seems to me like there's really no need to keep the full $15k in our savings account when it would be better served going toward student loans or investment goals. More like $5-10k seems reasonable to me--I genuinely can't think of anything that could wipe out more than this other than some kind of apocalypse. But I'm open to being convinced otherwise--if I'm way off here, please set me straight! Am I forgetting any kinds of emergencies that we need to plan for?","Anchoring, Status Quo Bias, Present Bias","The statement exhibits several biases. The individual starts with the ""rule of thumb"" of 6 months' living expenses in emergency savings, which serves as an anchor for their thinking ($15k). However, they then proceed to list various factors that reduce their need for emergency savings, such as stable income, subsidized housing, and comprehensive insurance.

Additionally, their emphasis on their current stable situation and lack of consideration for potential future uncertainties reveals a Present Bias, where they prioritize short-term comfort over long-term preparedness.","The individual exhibits a tendency to rely on mental shortcuts and their current situation when making financial decisions, often prioritizing short-term comfort and goals over long-term uncertainties."
mja2b8,AlzScience,"Save up separately for eventual new car? Or use emergency fund/monthly cash flow?

Our car is a 2006 Honda Pilot which we've had for around 5 years. It's had no major issues in the time that we've owned it, but we recognize that eventually it will bite the dust. The current value is around $4k so we probably would get a new car if any big repairs cost more than $2-3k. We would purchase a used car in the $8-10k range.

My question is, do we need to start saving up for a new car now? We already have $15k emergency savings. We also live on my income only and use all of my spouse's income to fund our saving and investment goals. So I figure if we needed to buy a car, we could use a chunk of our emergency savings to make a small down payment and redirect our monthly cash flow to pay it off quickly (or even just buy it in cash and use that monthly cash flow to rebuild our savings). If we temporarily redirected my spouse's income, we could pay off a car in a few months.

So youâ€™d base the percent being contributed after deducting your 401k contributions from your gross salary (and if applicable after your HSA deduction?)

My concern is, after maxing out my 401k and taxes, I'm only left with about 60% of my gross income. So my take home pay is around 5.5k a month. 

My question is, how do people manage to stay within the 30% guideline in HCOL areas? Most 1 bedroom apartments I've found are above 2k, which is significantly more than the 30% guideline. It concerns me because I feel like I am spending too much on rent and won't have enough to be able to save for things in the future like a down payment on a house or a car.","Anchoring, Status Quo Bias, Present Bias","The statement exhibits several biases. The individual is anchored to the general rule of spending 30% of net income on rent, which may not be feasible in a High-Cost-of-Living (HCOL) area like Seattle.

Additionally, the individual seems to be exhibiting a status quo bias by assuming that the 30% guideline is a universal standard that should be followed, without considering alternative approaches to allocating income in a HCOL area. Furthermore, the individual's concern about not being able to save for future goals, such as a down payment on a house or a car, suggests a present bias, where they are prioritizing short-term expenses over long-term goals.","The user tends to rely on general guidelines and rules of thumb, even when they may not be applicable to their specific situation, and struggles to adapt to changing circumstances, such as high living costs in a specific area."

I'm a 23 year old male. Currently trying to find private insurance coverage so I can opt  out of the mandatory LTC tax. I was quoted about $50/month by an agent for $100k of coverage and was told that was the lowest possible coverage to still meet the WA requirements for exemption. 

While I'm not too thrilled with the quote, it's still better than paying for the LTC tax forever. I was wondering if you could just pay for the insurance long enough to get the exemption and then cancel it? That way it wouldn't matter how much your premium is.

I have a little over $70,000 stashed in a HYSA and $31,000 remaining in student loans.

Currently hate my job - team/manager sucks, haven't really had opportunities to grow, work is mundane.

Hi,

I'm currently in the process of looking for a place to live. I live in a HCOL area (Los Angeles) and am hoping to stay where I am. I like the area, and my commute to work isn't too bad.

My primary job currently pays me $4,100/month, post-tax. I also picked up a part-time job for fun/extra money, which gives me an extra (at least) $500/month, although I've seen as high as $1,000/month. To be a little more cautious, I set my monthly income at $4,600 post-tax.

Currently, I budget (per month):

\- $1,200 for any shopping (groceries, fun shopping, eating out, etc.). This is an amount I've set based on my first job post-grad, and I've stuck to it. I've never really felt the need to exceed this, and I haven't had any issues sticking to this, pandemic or not.

\- $1,000 for savings ($500 emergency fund - currently have $30,000 and plan to just continue contributing $500/month, and $500 Roth IRA to max out at $6,000/year. I already contribute to my primary job's employer-sponsored 403(b) pre-tax so that I maximize the employer match, and the $4,100 is after that contribution/pre-tax deduction).

&amp;#x200B;

I don't have any debt (credit card, student loans), and my parents pay for my phone and car.

&amp;#x200B;

So, all that said, that leaves me with about $2,400. Currently, I pay $1,000 in rent. However, it's a 1 bedroom with a roommate, and we are hoping to upgrade to a 2 bedroom so we can have our own space. I have to admit my taste is a little expensive when it comes to what I want my living space to look like, so the prices I'm seeing for apartments I genuinely like would bump up my rent payment to $1,600/month (including utilities).

&amp;#x200B;

I recognize that $1,600/$4,600 puts me at around 35% of my income, which is above the 30% cap that I see a lot. That said, I don't know if it's ""acceptable"" from a financially wise standpoint to allow that excess if 1. I have the income, and would even have $800 to either save, invest, or use as a cushion for unexpected costs and 2. my living space is important to me.

&amp;#x200B;

On that note, any advice on what to do with the potentially extra $800/month I'd have? I'm thinking of investing, although I have no idea how to do that aside from my Roth IRA.

Salary 40,750 per year
It's a state job, great benefits + retirement
I pay the majority of the bills, added up I'm at 1600 per month. 

So the original question, would it be worth doing an early withdrawal of say 3k from my old 401k, paying off this newly accrued credit card debt so I can start with a clean slate as to start building my emergency fund back up?

The 401k has 55k in currently. I plan to roll this into the government pension plan I just became a member of. At the same time, I would like to start this job in a complete saving situation and would not like to have to worry about chipping away at credit card debt.  I understand there are penalties involved, I just wanted to get some feedback on whether or this group thought it would be a reasonable option?

Bad news is I had to bust into most of my emergency fund and take a loan out on my 401k to take care of a major foundation repair to my home. It pretty much wiped out my emergency fund. I lowered the contribution rate on my 401k temporarily to offset my take home, but plan to bump it back up as soon as the loan is paid back (2 year loan). Anyways, the good news is that I got a $5000 dollar per year raise at work. I decided to take the addition money each paycheck and have it deposited into my savings account each pay to build my emergency fund back up. It increased my current liquid savings contribution from $200 a month to $500 a month. I also have a joint savings with my wife that i contribute an additional $200 a month. Its for our kid though. My question is, after I have my emergency fund back in shape, roughly around September, should I lower what I put into my savings and increase my 401k contribution? I like the idea of having I bigger liquid savings account but I understand the importance of having propper retirement savings. I'm already behind on my retirement savings. I have 2 years left on my vehicle (400 a month) and was planning on trying to get as close to max on my 401k contribution as possible once it is paid for.

Hey guys, my step son has come into some inheritance the last few weeks and I have some questions I was wondering if anyone on this sub would be able to answer. 

- My stepsons paternal grandparents passed away within 3 weeks of each other last month. Due to being estranged from his father, they left every thing to him. 

- They left him everything as far as I can tell. They both had individual wills that declared everything be left to him in the event that they passed. He has seen a lawyer about it and this has been verified. He has another meeting with the lawyer next week.

- We did some digging and found that they have roughly 60k in savings, but also found that they pulled a equity line of credit for roughly 100k out on thier house. The current value on the house is roughly 300k. The house was/is paid off aside from the equity line.

- They had a few credit cards that have all been forgiven already

- He has transfered all the utilities into his name. The lawyer said to keep paying them but not to pay on any lines of credit 

- His grandfather passed first of heart failure, then his grandmother passed of the same thing in the samespot in the house believe it or not, exactly 3 weeks later. So we don't have all the info yet on any kind of retirement or brokerage accounts they may have had, or life insurance. 

- My wife and I paid the cremation cost of both grandparents, it cost us roughly 1800 dollars, yeah his dad is a real piece of work. He's going to pay us back though. 


1. Will he be responsible for the home equity line of credit?

2. How do we go about finding any kind of retirement savings they may have had? Life insurance? He can't seem to find any documentation on it. I know his grandfather had a 401k with BMW, he worked for them for 45 years. His grandmother had a union job for 30years and I know she had a pension. That's about it though.

Please have a look at my allocations and performance back test. This is my attempt to replicate Chris Cole's Dragon investment strategy (The market proof strategy that should prosper any market condition).

Its easy to look back at the past 40 years and see that this strategy would not have as high of a yield as remaining invested in equities.

This was mostly caused by the monetization of the U.S. Economy that started in the 70s with going off the gold standard. (Printing of Money) and interest rates that have been on a steady decline until now.

As you can see what happened in the market last year for example. I think there is a paradigm shift in play right now where I think equities in particular will not do as well as they have the past 4 decades.

1st If you go further back there where times where high inflation occurred most people today hold no gold. High inflation leads to decreased profits for various reasons. Companies can not just run deficits and be financed with cheap money. I think this is going to force the economy back into a real economy. You physically will have to produce something to prosper. In this type of economy Commodities and gold should do well. (Commodity futures/Gold ETF in this case...)

2nd there will be times of deflation in these cases Bonds/cash will do well which is covered in the commodities DBC ticker as well since most is held in cash and bonds with 25% in commodities or you can choose to hold additional bonds.

3rd There will be volatility, You will see as more people continue to move to passive investments you will get huge swings from day to day. a Volatility component will profit from this unpredictability. 5 out of 10 of the largest swings going back to the 1890s have occurred in the last 4 years.... This is my attempt to hedge and survive any market condition I might face. Will it yield the most? Only time will tell....

I will rebalance annually and might tweak a position here or there or add bonds if necessary at some point. But there is no where for bonds to go but down at this point in my estimation....

Please let me know your honest thoughts. I know this goes against what most have been doing the past 12 years where we have seen an awesome equites bull run that has mostly since 2008 been financed by printing money and keeping interest rates low.

3rd There will be volatility, You will see as more people continue to move to passive investments you will get huge swings from day to day. a Volatility component will profit from this unpredictability. 5 out of 10 of the largest swings going back to the 1890s have occurred in the last 4 years.... This is my attempt to hedge and survive any market condition I might face. Will it yield the most? Only time will tell....

I will rebalance annually and might tweak a position here or there or add bonds if necessary at some point. But there is no where for bonds to go but down at this point in my estimation....

Please let me know your honest thoughts. I know this goes against what most have been doing the past 12 years where we have seen an awesome equites bull run that has mostly since 2008 been financed by printing money and keeping interest rates low.

I purchased a 2023 Pacifica Hybrid earlier this year for approx. $52K. I traded in and put money down suffice it to say my current balance is $25,800.

When I purchased the car we needed two vehicles due to my work situation etc. Since then I was hired at a new job (Long term Government Contract) in which I am 100% remote.

We have 4 children so we do need a third row when we go out as a complete family. Vans seem to fit that niche well.

My wife's vehicle is a 2013 Dodge Grand Caravan with \~165000K no spring chicken for sure.

Here is my current situation. I make $236K per year. My debts are as follows:

1. 25.8K @ 5.48% The remainder of the loan on the Pacifica
2. 43K @ 8.49% Basement renovation (Added two conforming bedrooms to the basement)/New HVAC and generator.
3. Mortgage 300K @ 2.35% 

No other debts....

I know with my income I could knock out the car loan in a few months and be done with it, but would still have the full 43K to go on the other. (I would most likely have already been done with the car loan if it wasn't for me bankrolling a lot of the home improvements with cash.) We put about 70K into the house this past summer.

 It's the psychological aspect that is keeping me up and night. I despise debt but here I am found myself back into it this year.

Am I overthinking this should I just hunker down and get it paid off ASAP?

Carvana has offered me 47K to buy it from me that could take care of this loan and half the other loan but then I still have an old van but I might have some time to save up a considerable amount of cash to buy one outright with cash next time

I also shopped around local dealers they were looking to pay in the 40K range and I wasn't looking to take that haircut...

I have a 6-month emergency fund that I would prefer not to touch at all if that makes sense.

What would you all do if you were in my shoes? Had this debate with my wife we both know we will be fine either way I am the more emotional person when it comes to finances....

I  somewhat follow Dave Ramsey's advice on investing and I want to see what the general consensus in the community is as far as allocation of my investments go or if you think there are better alternatives.

I am 33 years old and plan to retire at 65, I am married with 4 children, wife works as a mother in our home.

First I invest 15% of my gross 145K in retirement

8% goes into my Roth 401K to get a match from my company which is 9% (Pre-Tax)  of my base pay for a total of 17%

The fund choices are fairly limited in the 401K but this is what I have picked 25% allocation to each:

I have about 120K in total retirement funds, since I just started at this new company that 401k is just starting the rest has been rolled over from my previous company to Vanguard Roth/Traditional IRA accounts.

I also found that my new company has many restrictions on rolling the 401K over to IRAs such as withholding company matches for a period of time so I will not be touching that money.

I also have a standard after tax vanguard brokerage account with the same funds as above, where I put anything extra I have a month in after paying my bills and and funding my retirement. This is on top of my 6 month emergency fund.

Do you feel that my allocation is correct for my age and to maximize my returns to be able to retire at a reasonable age? Is 120K at my age enough to meet my goals?  I have always contributed to my 401K since my late teens but I am really starting to be serious about investing. Also bear in mind I was not making this salary before, I only made about 60K 5 years ago, I ended at 84K then jumped to this new company where I am now making 145K.

For those of you who live in high cost-of-living areas, how do you square away ever getting out from under your mortgages?

You see all the people from low cost of living areas making this kind of money with very small mortgages. What is the point of chasing a higher salary in these HCOL areas if you can never afford to pay off your home?

I save 15% between my 401k and Roth IRA for retirement but I just feel like I am never going to get out from underneath such a large mortgage. I also see little value of paying it down early since the interest rate is so low, I would rather put the money towards retirement/savings.

I feel defeated that I will never get it paid off while being able to meet my other financial goals such as saving for retirement.

Hello, community.

I typically see some in the financial world talking down contributing to Roth 401K/Roth IRA when you are in the 22% or 23% tax bracket, because many times you may have less tax liability in retirement than your high earning years.

But one thing I never hear about is tax credits you get that can significantly reduce your tax rate. For example. I have 4 children that are currently 8K of tax credits. If the Stimulus bill passes and the child credit goes up to $3,000 that would be 12k in child tax credits. 

I did the calculations for this year with how things stand I am only paying a 6-7% effective tax rate. Using this logic wouldn't it make more sense for most everyone with kids to max out Roth as long as they can before they hit the income limits or their children grow up and leave?

The question above stands for the following reasons.

I am 33 and make 150K or so a year. With this income, I am able to save about 40% of my income which allows me to max out my Roth 401K, my wife's, and I Roth IRAs and still contribute $800 to a taxable brokerage account per month.

I don't want to pay down my 2.25% mortgage faster than what is required. I am debt-free except for the house, I also do not plan to stay here long term and would rather let my money grow and be more liquid.

Back to the original question, I know that conventional Roth advice is best followed because it is easy for those who may not have the phycological willpower to follow more complicated plans. However, I think I would end up with more money by the time I retire if I maxed out the traditional 401K, then moved to the Traditional IRA, then invested the savings I get with deferring taxes into my brokerage account. I have read in-depth analysis from three different sources that seem to bear the math out.

Since we do not know what tax rates are going to do in the future, and if one is indeed disciplined enough to invest the savings from the traditional tax deferral strategy, wouldn't it be better to invest in the traditional sense?

My family and I contracted a local solar company (Moxie Solar) to install solar panels on my home. It was something we thought about doing for a long time, did our research on and decided to go with them as at the time they had good reviews, and several of my co-workers have systems that were installed by them.

They have a milestone based contract that is in 4 parts. 25% due on signing, 25% due on completion of Utility approvals City Permits etc, 25% due upon installation, 25% due when turned on with approval of the utility company. ...

Anyway, I just finished getting approval from the city and my local utility company, paid my second portion, and not a week later the company went bankrupt!

There were two options when we decided to purchase:

1. Take the loan with one of their partners. 0% interest however they get it back by adding 15K to the cost of the job.

2. Pay in cash or get your own loan. I have the cash but decided to get a loan because the rates are low and I expected the system to pay for itself so to speak over time. Rather than paying a power bill I would just pay the solar bill. Cash/Financing on your own allowed me to get a really good rate and a heavy discount on the work over the life of the loan.

Anyway I feel stupid because if I would have gone with their solution I would have put no money down as they get paid by the bank at job completion. (one of our family friends did this and their loan/contract was canceled).

Here I was thinking I was doing the smart thing by either paying cash or financing at a low rate. But I am not the one who is out 30K while others got their contracts canceled.

I did the last payment in ACH so I hope I can get that back with fraud protection. So in the best case scenario I am only out 15K.

But as a customer I am considered an unsecured creditor at the bottom of the list to get paid back.

Here are the things I have done so far:

1. Filed a complaint with the state attorney general's office.

2. Called several lawyers but was advised they could not help since once they going into bankruptcy all cases against them cease and are not allowed to go forward.

3. Called my back to get the last payment ACH reversed. The first payment was outside of the window to get back.

Anyone have any ideas or am I just plain screwed?

I'm saving 10% for retirement and after all is said and done I'm left over with $500-1,000/mo to save on top of retirement.

With 20% down the estimated payment (including taxes and HOA) would be just shy of $2,000/mo.

I'm turning 29 in a couple of months and I'm getting really anxious to buy a house. 

I've found a couple of very nice move-in ready townhomes in decent neighborhoods for about $300k (Philadelphia suburbs). I have the 3.5% plus closing costs to put down with a FHA loan. The all-in monthly payment (mortgage, taxes, PMI) would be about $2,600. 

I'm an hourly employee currently earning $38/hr. I'm usually working at least a small amount of overtime every month. Last year my W2 said I made $84k.

On an average month my take-home pay is about $4500 after taxes, health insurance, and some money to my 401k. 

I realize as a home-owner you have to pay all utilities (gas, water, sewer, electric, gas) so I would say at most $400. 

I'm pretty confident I could live off of $1,500/mo if I cut unnecessary spending. I have no car payment. Insurance+gas is maybe $200, food $500 on the high end. I'm single. I currently rent for $1,500/mo and I currently spend a lot of money on hobbies because I have the disposable income to do so, but I plan to stop doing that now that I'm serious about buying. 

But here's the other thing, and where I may be wrong in my logic. I've never not gotten a 3% raise at work. In 5 years I'll be making $93k/yr. In 15 years, $124k/yr. And my mortgage will still be $2,600/mo? Actually less at some point when I hit 20% equity and drop the PMI and it will be even less. Maybe at some point in the next 5-10 years, the fed will start dropping rates and I can refinance.

Obviously nothing is guaranteed. I work in healthcare so long term unemployment seems extremely unlikely, but I guess possible.

17tkwp8,Basic_Butterscotch,"Is it possible to justify an $1800 apartment in my situation?

I'm 29, single no kids. Unlikely to start a family any time soon, if ever. 

Gross annual income is about $80k/yr. Net income is $2100 bi-weekly after all the deductions. 

I live in kind of a dump and have been for the past 3 years. I live in Montgomery county, PA which is, apparently, and extremely hot real estate market. For context, 1,000 square foot ranch-style homes are selling for north of $400k within driving distance of my job. 

I pay $1,250/mo for rent and my current job is about a 25 minute commute.

There's a very nice apartment complex right down the street from my job. It seems like a very nice area and the unit itself is very nice (in-unit washer/dryer, hardwood floors, quartz counters, tennis courts, private gym, the whole 9 yards). The commute would be less than 5 minutes. The problem is, it's $1,800/mo. 

I have no debts or car payment. My total monthly expenses outside of rent add up to about $1,500/mo and that's with a pretty liberal food budget, I could cut that back if I had to. 

My idea originally was to stay in this cheap apartment until I could afford to buy something, but... I'm not going to afford to buy any time soon or probably ever. So not I have to decide if it's worth it to dump an extra $600/mo into rent to live in a place that doesn't suck.","Anchoring, Status Quo Bias, Present Bias","The statement reveals several biases.

I have $28k in my 403(b) and $16k in my HYSA. No car payment or other debt. I just started a new job where I make $38/hr (about $80k/yr annualized). My take-home is about $2k bi-weekly after 10% to retirement, taxes, and health insurance. 

My currently monthly outflow is about $3k/mo. $1500 of that is rent + utilities. The rest covers food, car insurance, gas, home essentials, and food/litter for my cat. I make a concerted effort to put most of the remaining $1k into savings every month, but occasionally spend a couple hundred on myself. 

I'm looking at houses. I would like to have at least 2 bedrooms, 1 bath and 1,000 square feet. A basement/garage would be nice but I guess I could live without. I also don't want to live somewhere with a lot of crime so I'm looking in neighborhoods I know are decent. 

Anyway, to get to the point, the kind of house I want would run me around $350k from what I'm seeing on Zillow.

Even in the best case scenario where I have 20% down (which will take many years to get there) and interest rates come down to 4% again (I know, extremely unlikely), I STILL probably could not realistically afford $375k. 

You might wonder why a single, childless guy wants a house. Well, I just like the idea of having my own space, being able to do whatever renovations I want. A place that nobody can take away from me or evict me from. A place where I don't have to worry about paying rent when I'm 70 years old.

I gross just shy of $80k. I save 10% for retirement and my actual net income is about $4k/mo.

Ok, so now that all this payroll holiday stuff has been come in the news, its had me do the math on my own taxes to verify to see if they're correct or how they should be. Quick insight:  


I have my standard salary, and receive an additional small commission every month on the first paycheck of the month and I get paid every 2 weeks.  


I also have health insurance that of course my employer pays a portion of the premium and he also takes out that portion of the premium out of the first check of the month. The health insurance was just initially offered last year, so when this was set up, what they would do was before listing my actual gross salary for that pay period, they would deduct the premium from it and then tax it. So for example, if my gross salary is 1500, they subtract lets say 200 for the premium, so listed my gross salary as 1300 and tax the AGI accordingly. So I was ok with this, because even though my records weren't shown as me making my full salary, I at least know that I was being taxed correctly because as far as I know, health insurance premiums should be deducted from your gross salary pre-tax.  


This year however, they are listing my full gross salary for the pay period + commissions and what not, and I did the math on that for FICA/Medicare and it came out to the 7.65% tax amount. And at the end, they deduct the health insurance premium and deduct it as a Misc 1T deduction.  


Will I be able to get this/portion of this money back when I file my taxes given that its for health insurance premiums and it looks like by my math, its being deducted post-tax?

Purchased current home in 10/2017 for 200,900 with loan of 194k at 3.99% with P&amp;I at $929 and PMI at $102.

Once the COVID-19 situation started and the rates started to drop, I refinanced right in the beginning in March down to 3.25% on a $190k for a monthly of $827, was able to get appraisal waiver, closing costs at $2.5k, and was able to drop PMI, so I effectively dropped my monthly payment down by about $204.

Therefore, I would be able to recoup my closing costs in about 10 months, which would be January 2021 about for me.

So what I'm trying to decide is, if it would be worth it for me to refinance once again with the rates being just slightly lower, and buying the interest rate down even more. My current loan balance right now is at about $188,113. Just for curiosity I checked the rates on Bankrate for a few lenders and the amount of points they're charging to bring the interest rate down to around 2.5% is in the range of $3.6k-$4.2k. I should be able to get another appraisal waiver and I work with a closing attorney so I would be able to waive pretty much all settlement fees and just pay a few items at cost so that would help keep closing costs lower.

So if I just dropped the interest rate down to 2.5%, it'd drop my monthly down to about $743-751 (depending how much of the costs I'd decide to roll into the loan) resulting in about $76-$84 monthly savings.

So the reason I'm trying to decide if I should refinance is to see if I can find lenders who haven't started to include the market adverse fee coming up in their fees (if possible) but overall just to start the ""savings"".

We have no plans of moving from this house whatsoever in the near future, and don't have no long term plan of considering moving say in the next 5-6 years.

If I had a monthly payment in the $740 range, taxes and insurance comes out to about $220 a month (I don't have an escrow account, I manage myself), and in current market I'm sure I could possibly rent this place out for about $1.3-1.4k conservatively and so I imagine 5-6 years down in the future I could probably rent for more.

So my question is, is this something you all would consider would be worth doing?

nldpjv,bcampeon,"Surprise doctor/hospital bill - should I have to pay this?

My wife got a referral to have a head CT scan done by her doctor and the procedure of course went through the insurance to make sure it was approved first. When it finally was, they called us to give us an estimate of what it would cost us or what our portion to pay would be to make sure we wanted to go through with it and we said yes. 

After the procedure was said and done, she paid the amount we were told the day of at the hospital for $446. We got our EOB afterwards stating that was the amount we would owe and so we thought that was that. The EOB also states that the services were provided by the hospital.

Well, just a couple of days ago, we got another bill for $543.99 after adjustments ($846 originally) from Quantum Radiology PC. We weren't told or advised we would be receiving a separate bill from a different group/doctor and assumed the original $446 was everything included given we went in network for everything and also received approval for everything upfront with the amount we would be expected to pay.

Does this count as a ""surprise"" medical bill and aren't there laws or recourses for these types of bills now?

thlpl0,bcampeon,"Questions in preparing for a 401k early withdrawal

My dad is planning on taking SOME money out of his 401k as an early withdrawal. I've tried talking him out of it, but he has fully decided on it. He is leaving his job to be able to do so as his current 401k plan company is not allowing him to withdraw any money, so I've helped him with opening a traditional IRA with Merrill Edge as he banks with BofA and he wants to keep everything consolidated.

The thing I'm wondering is what would be the best way to go about it? He is currently fully invested in Principal LifeTime Hybrid 2035 CIT X, a target date fund. Should he sell all his shares before rolling over to ME and just roll over the cash? Or would it just be easier to roll everything over as is and leave the investments in ME as is?

Also, I don't have much experience with ME funds. Are there any target date funds one could recommend with ME that I could look into for him without having to pay any fees? Like are there ME target date index funds like Schwab has that he could buy?

And lastly, it is my understanding the federal and state taxes can be withheld and taken from his 401k balance, but he would actually need to have the money for the 10% penalty for tax season next year. Is this true? I plan on calling ME with him to confirm as well, but just want to get a head start on some general info with people who might have had some experience with this.

Any other suggestions or things to look out for would be greatly appreciated.","Status Quo Bias, Present Bias, Authority Bias","The statement exhibits several biases.

xnm51x,bcampeon,"Should I invest less in my HSA?

I am currently 31 years old, married, no kids and make $70k/year and have had a HDHP with access to a HSA at work since I started my current job last year. My wife doesn't work. I currently have my paychecks set up to max out my HSA for this year so $280.77 is taken out of my check bi-weekly ($7300/year) and so far have a total contributed amount of $9610.63, although the balance is lower since I have the money invested and market is down.

The rest of my investment contributions are $150/month into a ROTH IRA for both me and my wife ($300/month, $3600/year) and I'm also putting $100/month ($1200/year) into a joint taxable brokerage account.

My question is, should I contribute less to my HSA and contribute more to our ROTHs? I've been prioritizing HSA contributions due to the triple tax advantage (I have been saving receipts for all our medical stuff). and also to lower my AGI some for the tax year since ROTH contributions aren't tax deductible (although if I understand it correctly, I might be able to get a small break for the Saver's Tax Credit).

 Following the usual guideline of saving 15% of income for retirement, that figure for us is $10,500 and with these amounts, it puts us at $10,900, not including the money put in the taxable brokerage account.

In the case of the taxable brokerage account, the reason I started that is to start growing additional money on the side for other things outside of our emergency fund that might come up in the future to ensure we have extra funds (major home repairs, car purchase, etc) that we could liquidate and still not have to dip into the emergency fund first. Or if it we end up not needing it for those kinds of things, it would just be extra money we have for the future.

xnnrut,bcampeon,"What's a good investment plan for 53 year old with Merrill Edge

Long story short, my dad recently rolled over his 401k into a IRA at the end of March/beginning of April (pretty good timing given that was the last highest point the market has been at this year) and hasn't reinvested the money since.

He has $200k sitting and so I've been asking him if he's ok with me reinvesting his money, especially now that the market is down, and he seems to be ok with me doing it now for him as he doesn't really understand markets/investing.

He went with Merrill Edge since he banks with BofA and just wanted to keep it all in one place and also benefit from the Platinum Honors with them.

I'm planning on DCA'ing his money in case the market keeps going down, it doesn't freak him out too much. But I'm also not familiar with ETF's as I have my accounts through Schwab and am more familiar with their mutual funds.

Any suggestions as to what funds/ETFs I should invest his money in, especially given his age? I'm planning on following Bogle's 3 fund portfolio, but I'll be honest, I don't 100% understand the bond allocation part of it.

The strategy of investing in stocks with the best 52-week gains exhibits Recency Bias, as it overemphasizes recent performance, assuming it will continue. The Affect Heuristic is also present, as the investor seems to be making decisions based on readily available and emotionally appealing information (recent gains), rather than thoroughly analyzing the stocks' fundamentals.

The individual's positive emotional response to not owing anything on their credit card suggests Loss Aversion, as they are deriving utility from avoiding debt.

Additionally, Recency Bias is present, as the person is referencing a recent event (the decrease in their net worth last year) and seems to be extrapolating it as a representative experience, rather than considering long-term trends or averages.

However, the individual seems to be mentally compartmentalizing their wealth, viewing their retirement accounts and down payment savings as separate entities. This is a classic example of Mental Accounting, where individuals treat different types of money (e.g., retirement savings vs. down payment savings) as if they have distinct purposes or ""accounts"" in their minds, rather than considering their overall financial situation and goals. The individual may be overlooking the possibility of using a portion of their retirement savings to supplement their down payment, or exploring alternative options such as a first-time homebuyer program or a mortgage with a lower down payment requirement.","The individual exhibits Mental Accounting bias by separating their wealth into distinct mental accounts, rather than taking a holistic view of their financial situation."

Additionally, the statement implies that the potential drawbacks of having more money (e.g., fake relationships, expectations) outweigh the benefits, which is a manifestation of Loss Aversion, where the fear of losses (in this case, loss of genuine relationships) is more significant than the potential gains (e.g., financial security).","The user exhibits a tendency to make financial decisions based on emotions and a fear of potential losses, rather than objective considerations, reflecting a bias towards Affect Heuristic and Loss Aversion."

ewgtsc,Bigmealplantime,"My sizable trading loss this week may have given me the biggest lesson in retirement planning

The only major dives I've taken in trading have been with options. I know I'm not alone in this. It's a massive math animal that just happens to work reasonably well, unless you slip up just a little bit.

But I do enjoy the research, the math, and the thrill. But I'm also starting to realize why people have a retirement fund separate from the rest of their money. And as much fun as trading is, I finally realize why people say it's hard to beat the market. In the last 3 months, after this loss, I'm level with the S&amp;P. And a LOT more stressed out (and getting concerned trading takes too much time away from my day job or having a life), and very full of ""if I'd just fucking sold this x then"" remorse that just ruins my happiness.

I don't really have the money to invest in theta and sell options, or it'd be a damn slow start and a LOT more learning.

So I remembered my grandpa always talking about his dividends, and this article I read about investing in the S&amp;P as your retirement fund. Then I read a ton about QE and world markets and realized how dumb I was for selling those calls (well maybe, we'll see). I also learned by just investing in the S&amp;P, it's good because the leverage resets daily so I don't start losing tons from decay. And the fees are reasonable. And it's managed, with Apple being a majority holding, not just a ""bunch of standard and poor banks and old companies and shit"". And there are **dividends** which you can **reinvest**.

Suddenly I see why ""average"" people think putting money away for retirement is a savings account, and why they're worried. And why so many guys day trading or swing trading end up saying ""you can't beat the market"". And why the happiest people I've ever met just say how they put some money into their IRA every month and into whatever ETF/fund they like (and even then how some screw it up and pick just a sector ETF they think is great). I did this for a while, and was left scratching my head as to why I wouldn't just trade with the money, make more, and get to spend it. But then you run a compound interest calculator with reinvested dividends, and you see **huge numbers that if divided over the years it took of saving/building, would be equal to having a 2nd high paying job.** Without the stress of thumbing around on Robinhood at 9am scrambling to maintain your 25% of growth which you end up losing half of. Not to mention who looks forward to a life of that? I'd rather live within my means without the ups and downs, and look forward to retiring at 50 if I so choose.

I think I get you guys. Or at least a little bit better.

Here's what I'm proposing I do with my money - interested in your feedback:

1. Chop off 5% to keep in Robinhood to play with
2. Keep 45% in my savings account for liquidity
3. 25% into my IRA, into SPYD, and contribute $5k/year
4. 25% into my bank's brokerage account (so I don't feel the urge to fuck with it) into a few solid tech stocks, then split off $5k/year from this (assuming it doesn't flop) into my IRA. Not using an IRA here so the funds remain available as my readily-available rainy day fund

f7lvba,Bigmealplantime,"How do I make more money?

I realize that subject is casting a huge net, and I'm saying it with a little bit of humor. But I'm looking for ways to boost my income at least 10-20% over the next year. I'll try to make this post as objective and as organized as possible. Hoping some of you have some helpful suggestions that will spark some attainable ideas for me. I'm mainly looking for small things I might be able to work to add to what I already do - not looking for a major life change or anything.

**Background:** I'm in my mid-30s, I have a BS in management but a very strong IT background. I attended school for IT and pharmacology briefly too. I live in NYC, so there's plenty of opportunity.

**What I do now:** I've helped run a small logistics business for the last 6-7 years, specifically the IT/finance/managerial aspects of it. My day job isn't the highest paying, but it allows me to work from home and control my hours - most weeks I can get everything done in 30 hours or so. This is key, as a ""normal"" job that pays double would easily consume double the hours and restrict my freedom to explore other things. Plus, it's enjoyable working with a few close friends and I do believe this is a *killer* resume builder for the day that we have to move on. Ideally, we'd like to sell the business within a few years (we've sold 2 in the past already).

I do work in nightclubs as a lighting tech on weekends. I do have to limit this a little bit, or I find that the late nights/lack of sleep take a toll on my day job. I enjoy it, and try to expand my knowledge here, but lately I've been hitting a limit on time I have to take online courses and such.

I also do some stock trading - I have over 10 years of experience in this, but have only begun really honing it in the last 2 years or so. I understand very very few people can turn this into true income (and not eat losses that set them back), but I truly do enjoy learning more about the market, world economics, and trading techniques. I'm up the last 3 years, but it's not consistent, so I limit my trading portfolio to a relatively small amount now and consider anything I make to be a bonus.

**My strong points &amp; what I like doing:** Aside from the above, I consider myself to have very strong tech skills, and I can learn more extremely quickly. I've been placed in some high pressure IT situations and have never truly failed. I believe this is where I enjoy trading - I can do it in between other work, there's a huge technical/mathematical component to it, and it doesn't require a constant commitment (meaning I can stop for a month if my main job requires it). 

I also enjoy the medical field, pharmacology, and seeing how that can help people. Even had a doctor recently ask why I'm not a doctor - pretty flattering, but I have a long way to go lol. Unfortunately, it seems nearly any real money to be made here would require a major life change, and isn't just something I can dabble in on the side. For a while I was trading pharma stocks to try to merge those interests, but it's just too time intensive and unstable.

Other interests include pretty much anything tech, passive money making schemes, and fitness. After a money-sucking relationship the last couple years, I've also taken a lot more interest in improving my budgeting skills, so I have been saving a lot more too.

**People who know me come to me for:** tech things, stock trading stuff (how things work, not ""tips""), and ways to solve their small medical ailments. 

**One of the best professional compliments I've received:** while on a business trip, the leader of several PhD software engineers told others he was extremely impressed meeting someone with such a great blend of technical and business knowledge.

n3yvvp,Bigmealplantime,"$20k inheritance, looking for suggestions on best use

Hi all,

I recently got $20k from the sale of my late grandfather's car.

My parents were originally going to cut me $1k/month from it for extra income. While this is nice, I feel the money would quickly go to waste.

I consider myself pretty skilled in investments. After my grandpa's death, my family now refers to me as the investment savvy one. But of course, I don't know everything.

I did have an ex drain my life savings a few years ago, so I wouldn't be opposed to using it to build that back up and have a nice rainy day fund. Used to keep a nice $60k on hand split between savings and investments, but that's almost toast now.

Similar to above, I do budget $500/mo for retirement savings currently (more if I wouldn't max out my IRA contribution), so could do that for the next few years and/or use the extra $500 to rebuild my savings.

My retirement fund (I'm 36) could use a lot of work as well. I've been self employed for a decade, so I don't have a 401k to really build it up.

Hi! As the title says, my soon to be wife and I are getting married on April 27, and we just became aware that contributing to an HSA (mine) and general purpose FSA (my soon to be wife's) will be problematic. 

Ideally, she is able to cancel her FSA and come onto my HSA under a family plan.

* By end of April, I will have contributed $1,440.20 to my HSA.

Hi there, in April I [posted](https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/12pp8nq/getting_married_soon_and_spouse_has_an_fsa_i_have/) in this sub looking for some help. My spouse and I were getting married soon and she had an FSA, and I had (and currently have) a self-only HSA. Having learned that having both an FSA and HSA would be an issue, she canceled her FSA on April 26 (within the month of our marriage) so that I could continue contributing to my HSA, which I've done throughout this year. I will reach the self-only coverage HSA contribution max on my final paycheck next week, $3,850. 

However, my spouse recently was notified by her FSA provider, Health Equity, that she still has an available balance of $237.99 on her FSA. This balance is from contributions before our marriage date, and before she canceled her FSA. [Here's a screenshot](https://imgur.com/a/UEzh1i4) of her FSA contributions, which total $114.41. She then spent $112.01 of this at the FSA store on April 20, before cancelling the FSA on April 26. There is a $350 election amount that processed January 1 (so $237.99 remaining).

I'm hoping my HSA contributions this year are still eligible, and will not have to be withdrawn or subject to any penalties, given that she canceled her FSA prior to our marriageâ€”but we are confused as to why there is still an available FSA balance.

I guess I am trying to find reasons not to get this Tesla as it is a dream for me to have that car but I also want to be as pragmatic as possible to avoid having lifestyle inflation happen to me.

PROS:

First brand new car ever

Chance to build credit with on-time payments

Saving a ton on gas per month

I would finance to own it not lease so it would be mine after a while

CONS:

I donâ€™t drive that much since I am a â€œhybridâ€ worker (stay home to work more than go in)


Could be using that money to invest even more in the stock market


Would be over most estimations of car-value to income ratio limits (would be about 55% of my gross income [$64k configuration price]

I also got approved for the full $20k so realistically if it goes through I could pay off the rest of the $6k by June.

I am wondering how my wife's income will be counted when apply for a mortgage once she goes back to work after maternity leave/ child rearing leave. She will be going back to the same employer she worked for for 8 years but after 2 years off for child rearing. I know typically they look for 2 years on continuous employment prior to applying for the mortgage. The main concern is we want to upgrade to a larger house but would like to buy first, then sell current house so we would carry two mortgages for a few months. Approval of the new house alone would be no issue on my salary but carrying both will put our DTI a little too high based on my salary alone. So i would hope her salary would also count even with that gap.","Status Quo Bias, Present Bias, Recency Bias","The individual is concerned about the mortgage approval process for their wife's income after a 2-year gap in employment. They mention that typically, lenders look for 2 years of continuous employment prior to applying for a mortgage. However, they are optimistic that their wife's return to the same employer after an 8-year prior work history and 2-year gap might be viewed favorably. This line of thinking reveals a Status Quo Bias, as they seem to assume that their current situation (wife returning to previous employer) will be treated similarly to their previous situation (continuous employment). Additionally, the focus on their current financial situation and the desire to upgrade to a larger house indicates a Present Bias, where they prioritize their current needs over long-term financial implications. Lastly, the emphasis on their wife's return to work and its potential impact on their mortgage application suggests a Recency Bias, where they are overemphasizing recent events (wife's return to work) and underemphasizing the potential risks associated with the gap in employment.","The individual exhibits a tendency to favor their current situation and recent events when making financial decisions, often prioritizing short-term needs over long-term implications."

I am in the process of getting life insurance. While visiting my doctor today, he had suggested getting multiple smaller policies around 250k each about a year apart instead of getting a 1 million policy because they do not do as thorough of a screening for smaller policies and typically don't require doctor's visits.

The suggestion from their doctor to get multiple smaller policies instead of a single large one seems to have led to a degree of trust due to the doctor's authority, indicating Authority Bias. The person's concern about the insurance company's screening process and potential detection of multiple policies suggests a Status Quo Bias, as they seem inclined to follow the doctor's advice and question alternative approaches. Additionally, their skepticism about the benefits of getting multiple policies and concerns about detection imply a Present Bias, as they prioritize the immediate ease of obtaining smaller policies over potential long-term consequences. Lastly, their rhetorical questions (""If it really works out better wouldn't everybody just do this?"") suggest a Sunk Cost Fallacy-like thinking, implying that if many people aren't doing it, there must be a reason.","The individual exhibits a tendency to follow authority figures and conform to suggested approaches, while also being influenced by immediate convenience and questioning alternative strategies based on perceived sunk costs."

tb5nqc,blindmike95,"Weighing pros and cons of staying at my pension job long term

Hi all,

I'm trying to figure out whether it makes more financial sense to stay at my state pension job long term, or if I would be better off going somewhere else where I can make a higher salary. Trying to figure this out is making my head spin!
I'm 26, and currently work in an entry-level IT position making $20/hr. I've been here for about a year and a half. Within the next few years the person ahead of me will be retiring, and I expect to take her position. My guess is that she makes about $65k/year. There probably wouldn't be room for me to move up after this point. This company has a union, so on average we get 2-3% raises every 2-3 years. This job has a pension, so we don't pay into social security. The health insurance is also pretty cheap (just under $400 a month for the family plan) with low deductibles and copays. 
I could leave this position and go to the public secter, and increase my salary, but that would mean losing the pension and paying into social security. How much more would I need to make in order to justify doing this? I'm trying to figure out if the better long-term option is to stay for a slightly lower salary and the pension, or leave for a potentially higher salary and lose the pension. 

Here is some info on the pension:
vested after 10 years
A public employee retirement allowance consists of two parts: an annuity and a pension. The contributions that are deducted during the course of your creditable service are deposited for you in an annuity savings fund by your retirement board. The interest that accrues on these contributions is credited to your individual account. The part of your retirement allowance that is based on the total amount in your annuity savings account on the date of your retirement is the annuity.
A pension is the difference between the total retirement allowance specified by law and the annuity as described above.
The superannuation retirement allowance of any member may not exceed 80% of his or her five-year average annual rate of regular compensation.

The retirement allowance calculation is 
benefit rate x Your Highest Five Year Average Annual Rate of Compensation x creditable service

Assuming at least 30 years of creditable service, benefit rates are:
67 or older, 2.50%
66, 2.375%
65, 2.250%
64, 2.125%
63, 2.0%
62, 1.875%

Benefit rates are slightly lower for less than 30 years of service. I can provide if needed. 

What are your thoughts on what would make the most sense in my situation?

pq5lrm,Bluetoothbird,"EOY approaching - HSA or IRA or Roth IRA

Hello, I work in tech in CA and have a 401k from an employer that I max out and the employer does a decent matching

My spouse is currently not working and I have a traditional IRA in her name where we can contribute up to 6k that is tax-deductible.

I have an HSA family plan where I can contribute up to $7200 which will be tax-deductible on the federal level. CA state tax still applies.

* Has ROTH IRA - No contribution made for 2022 yet
* No Traditional IRA ever

* New Employer 401k
* Has Spousal IRA with Betterment (Traditional IRA) - $6k was deposited in 2020 and 2021 which was tax-deductible (value is now $11k)
* No Roth IRA account yet

&amp;#x200B;

**Questions:**

* On the Husband's side, we are clear. He needs to open a Traditional IRA --&gt; Contribute 6k --&gt; Keep it in cash --&gt; Convert to ROTH IRA the next day. There is no pro-rata rule for him
* Should we do this anytime in 2022? or should we do this in the first week of Jan 2023 for 2022?

&amp;#x200B;

* On the Wife's side, we will have to go thru pro-rata conversion.
   * **Option 1:** Should we convert the current 11k --&gt; Roth IRA and then do a separate 6k for 2022 --&gt;. Roth IRA?
   * **Option 2:** or should we contribute 6k first and then convert the 17k in one go?
   * **Option 3:** Move Trad IRA balance to employer 401k (still checking if they allow it) and just do a plain simple 2022 Trad IRA --&gt; Backdoor ROTH IRA
   * Trying to understand the pros/cons of each scenario here. Would like to keep paperwork simple.
   * If it helps, Trad IRA is with Betterment and we plan to open ROTH IRA with Fidelity
   * Again, irrespective of Option 1 or Option 2 - would like to know if there are any suggestions on performing the conversion before 31st Dec vs doing it in the first week of Jan 2023.

I'm 26, making about 75k/year gross income.

I currently have been living in an 850-900 sq ft. rental home I've been in for about 3 years.  I've been at my current job for about 5 years with no hope of getting out to another location for 4-5 years most likely. I was very fortunate to find this small house, albeit pretty crappy, for $575/mo and they haven't raised the rent on me since I've been here.  It's also pretty risky I suppose, but after the first year lease, we've been on a non-written agreement to do month-to-month since then with nothing actually signed.

Recently about 1.5-2 years ago I decided to get serious with retirement investments early for the future because I saw that my parents (separated) are struggling with nearly no retirement each, and I don't want that, I want to retire early (My dream is 47-50, I'm eligible at 47).  So I raised the 5% to 10%, then quickly to 15% (this was all roth TSP) and seeing it was a lot out of my paycheck for me.  Then after discussion and realizing I could max traditional TSP without as much of a cut to my take-home since it's pre-tax, I later quickly started maxing that out about last year.  I also finally learned about ROTH IRA and started one of those about 2-3 years ago (2023 is my third year maxing roth ira).  **So about 38% of gross income is invested in TSP (govt 401k) and Roth IRA, both S&amp;P 500 style funds.**

I've become addicted with saving towards retirement and I'm seeing the number grow more and more.  I try to follow the rule of having 1x annual earnings ($75k) saved by 30 years old, and according to Fidelity, between the two retirement accounts, some crypto (I know longer invest in but im holding), and individual stocks (no longer invest, but holding), and Checking Account balances, I am at $75,367 as of writing this at 26 years old.  It feels like a huge achievement and I can't wait to hit my first $100k!

Since I'll most likely be staying here in the town I live in for my job (not easy to transfer at all), I'd like some more living space as I've only stayed here (850-900 sq ft.) because it's cheap rent compared to similar for $1200-$1500/month rent.  My younger brother (21) whom has never left home to live on his own and wants a change of lifestyle has mentioned coming to live with me (states away from home).  This would also be the reason for more space, and as someone who is single for a while now and missing home, it would be nice to roommate with my younger brother who I share a very similar personality with.  I would probably charge him like $200 for a room per month if that.  It feels weird to charge my brother.  Not sure if I should expect more or none at all from him (open to advice on that).

I also don't want to be reliant on a roommate's rent payment to afford mortgage.

&amp;#x200B;

I have researched a lot, including Reddit, and understand that I should probably just leave the investments in TSP and IRA sit and don't withdraw!  **My main concern is, should I contribute LESS to those to have more money for a house mortgage** that can provide more living space, nicer place that isn't old and wearing down (I didn't mention but the hot summers are cooled by window units and winters warmed by one big heater vent in the living room that struggles to circulate to the rest of house.  I would love central cooling and heat), and starting to invest my monthly rent towards my own property instead of someone else's pockets.  I understand that rent is a necessary expense on it's own so it shouldn't be frowned upon; that's why I've stayed renting for so long, but I think I'm wanting to make that jump.

The only concern is after I've finally been able to achieve maxing TSP and IRA (this year would be the first year  both are 100% maxed), it's hard to think about contributing less so I can afford a mortgage in this insane 6+% loan interest market with expensive houses (around here the good ones are $150k+).  I would love a nice kitchen, big living room,  central air, and a backyard (I have none of this), but I also don't like to jump into big purchases since my only debt currently is $4k in student loans that  may be forgiven from the President.  My 2017 car has been paid off and I like to make extra payments on debt (factoring that into mortgage, I don't want nothing leftover each month, I'd like to make extra payments.  I also pay off my 3 credit cards same month to avoid debt (treat them like debit cards).

I was told to buy before Covid happened in 2019 and I didn't listen, and the market went up.  I don't want to wait around forever hoping rates will decrease only to see them go up more.  I'm not sure if it applies to homes, but I understand time in market is better than timing it, so I think I want in.

I can't afford a very big down payment (maybe $4k-$6k after tax refund) so I might be looking at an FHA loan whatever that would mean. I don't even know what I can afford. I plan to talk to lenders soon since I've finally made the big step of talking to a realtor (I've always chickened out when they bug me while window-shopping on Zillow).

Main goal is early retirement

I want a home and to stop renting soon, but I've saved nothing liquid in my bank account for a down payment (only about $5k emergency).  I've been investing as much as possible in TSP and Roth IRA for 2 years, just now starting max contributions this year.  

I've been told since I'm 26, these are very important early years to get money in TSP and IRA now for compounding earnings for an early retirement (50yo if not earlier).  I'm nervous to cut back on contributions, but I could save a 20% down payment for a 200k home in about 1.5 years (doing 5% tsp match only) vs. 4-5 years if I keep maxing out both tsp and ira.

Now, my goal for the last 4 years has been early retirement (I can retire with pension at earliest 47yo, but TSP, IRA, and Social Security probably has to come later, not sure if I can collect earlier, but I'm still figuring out/learning how that all works.

I would probably be fine, if I went back down to just 5-10% TSP contributions with no IRA contributions, but I want to do whatever is best long term.

I also have been trying to save hard for a down payment to start paying on a house, and I waited when the interest waits were 2-3%, then I waited when they were 5%, and now they're 6-7% so I'm starting to worry, but I also know I am fortunate to have a really low rent, but I'm getting sick of the tiny place I'm in with no back yard, full dirt front yard (desert area).  

&#x200B;

I also like having no debt basically and know student loan payments are coming back.  

I'm stuck between:

1. Buy cheaper house $140k-180k that needs fixing (I'm not savvy with DIY, so fixing would cost me), and keep maxing retirement accounts
2. Buy more expensive $200k-$250k house that is mostly move-in ready, but might have to shorten retirement contributions a bit, but hope that the house investment will make up for the loss in retirement contributions. 
3. Keep renting at $650 and save for higher down-payment at risk of housing prices/interest rates increasing anyway, and possibly getting REALLY tired of this small place (Again, I'm grateful for the low rent compared to most, but its small sq ft and pretty crappy house in dangerous area, also I don't have central air, i have 2 window units that don't cool the whole house and sometimes trip the breaker.  Central air would be a dream come true). 

\*And then I don't know if I should just pay off my student loans with or without buying a  house, or ride that wave of monthly payments hoping for some kind of forgiveness. 

\*I've also considered renting out a room if I get one of the bigger houses.  I think a roommate could be fun, but I've never dealt with it before.

Landlord hasn't raised price since I started 2 years ago, but also not on lease anymore, I just keep paying monthly and they keep letting me live here.)

Hulu: $8

Student loans: $73 (about $3000 remaining) (also not paying during the pause from the president)

Rent Insurance: $21

Gas bill: $40

Geico car insurance: $90

Internet: $80

Spotify: $16

Phone Bill: $42

Electricity: $100

Fidelity Roth IRA: $500 (to max $6000/year)

Humble Bundle Games: $13

Emergency savings: $200

Vacation: $100

Total: $1858

Leftover: $1042

Minus food (I didn't factor that in yet but I'd say roughly $200 maybe?)
So maybe $842 leftover?


I want to move because this place even for 1 feels cramped and depressing, the neighbor dogs all around bark all night and neighbors won't listen to me to take them inside, but that's a different matter.

I WANT to move to a bit bigger place and have it be my own, but I also have gotten into a really good retirement savings kick 2 years ago after learning about saving early (schools should really do better with teaching this young. My coworker taught me and opened my eyes to how much I could have in the future. So I went from 5% 401k to %15 and maxing Roth IRA.)

I don't want a fixer upper, I'd prefer move in and ready to live with barely any fixings right away if at all. 
Most houses for this are $200k-$275k in my area. $100k-$165k are mostly way outdated, need work, or crack house but has much sq. footage.

I very much want to retire early so I know saving is important, but I also know houses can be good for equity and earning money over time as well.

I don't have much for a down payment (maybe $4-5k) currently because I throw a lot into retirement (I think it's a lot, it feels like it to me) unless I take from my IRA contributions or 401k/tsp loan which I heard you shouldn't do. So I'd probably have to do FHA Loan (would be my first house). 

What can I afford if I keep contributing to retirement? 

Should I back off retirement a bit to afford more monthly mortgage? 

Should I suck it up and stay in this crap house because it's cheap rent and keep adding to retirement? (I know rent can be looked at as an expense and not throwing money away, but still), and saving for more down payment?

I want money leftover for the random splurge and what not too. I buy a lot of clothes at thrift store and I'm set for a while there. I only buy family gifts for bdays, I don't do Christmas gifts anymore to save money, and if we do it's one gift secret Santa. Idk else what expenses are needed.

I said hell no to buying about 3 years ago at beginning of my career because I made about half what I make now, but I think my coworker was right in that it was a good time to buy. Now I'm wanting to buy and it feels like a crappy time to buy that might get worse. Knowing my luck I'll buy and in one year the house will be worth way less from adjusting to the market. 

I really don't want to move rentals just to have my rent increase by double, then it will feel like I'm throwing it away. I'd rather spend double what I pay now towards equity.

\-I have a Traditional IRA (a rollover from a 401k at a previous employer) that has about $25k in it. Also, I honestly haven't looked too closely at this and instead have let my financial advisor handle my IRAs--but I believe the main fund is VSTAX.  
\-I have a Roth IRA that I started a while back with about $15k in it.  
\-I have a couple of 529s for my kids with about $10k in them.  
\-No debt except my house.  
\-Monthly expenses of about $2,000.  
\-I have an emergency fund of six months' worth of expenses.

In my new situation:

\-Gross income of about $100k.  
\-Combined with my wife we are in the 22% tax bracket.  
\-New employer matches 100% of contributions up to 3% of salary.  
\-New 401k can be Traditional or IRA. I'm still not sure if it's an either/or kind of thing or if I can do both simultaneously.  
\-New 401k allows for roll ins from other 401ks.

I know fund offerings and expense ratios come into play, and I'm sure there's a way that benefits my financial advisor the most if it goes to an IRA. I understand he needs to get paid too, but I also want to protect my interests. For example, I wouldn't want to move $160k and based on the fees structure, he automatically get 10% or something right off the bat--that would seem foolish of me...

What would you do with the existing 401k if you were in my situation?

Also, if you happen to have any thoughts going forward about whether to contribute to a Traditional or Roth 401k, I would be interested to hear that too.

Sorry if this sounds like a dumb question, but I have a financial advisor that Iâ€™ve used for over a decade, and the more I read and understand about investment strategies, the more I think I can do what theyâ€™re doing myself and not pay a 1% feeâ€¦

I have a Traditional and Roth IRA and two 529s with their firmâ€¦.so how does one go about essentially having the same accounts with the same funds (presumably) but not have it be managed by the financial advisor (and therefore not pay fees)?

oeu2rt,brethart91,"Traditional or Roth 401k in my specific situation?

Hi, I know this Traditional vs. Roth 401k (or IRA) discussion has been brought up a million times (so much so there's a section in the wiki about it:

[https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/wiki/rothortraditional](https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/wiki/rothortraditional)

However, as much as I research this topic and read the wiki, I still am unsure what makes sense to do. So I'm asking point blank--which would you do?

\- I'm 35. I file taxes jointly with my wife.  
\- We have a combined income of around $185k.  
\- We currently make contributions to our traditional retirement accounts (so pre-tax), but I'm starting  a new job that offers both Traditional and Roth 401ks which is why I'm asking this.  
\-We qualify for tax deductions/credits that I won't qualify for in retirement. Specifically, child tax credit and mortgage interest deduction.  
\-We're planning on maxing out our 401k/403bs regardless of the type  
\-We're planning on maxing out our HSA  
\-We're planning on maxing out our IRAs  
\-No debt besides mortgage, and we have 6 months' worth of expenses in an emergency fund if we need it.  


So here I am--what feels like right in the middle of everything, where I don't have an astronomical income nor do I have a very low income that would make the decision easier. I meet some of the criteria that would lean towards a Roth 401k but not all of it. Yes, like many people, I would like to retire early--maybe around age 50 if that's possible--so I've also read up on the Roth IRA ladder--so I'm not sure if that plays into this.

Just a few more notes:

\-I'm planning to roll my existing plan into a Traditional IRA and let it sit (this decent-sized balance maybe can serve as the source for the Roth conversion ladder?)

\-As I mentioned, I'm planning to max out either the Traditional or Roth 401k at my new employer, followed by the HSA, followed by our Roth IRAs that we currently have. After that, I think we're looking at taxable brokerage accounts..

So given the various deductions I have/will have, does the Traditional or Roth 401k make more sense?

I am in the midst of changing jobs, and I currently have a Dependent Care FSA through my employer that Iâ€™ve signed up to contribute the max ($5k) too. That means, at this point in the year, Iâ€™ve contributed and claimed about half of it.

I know after I leave I have three months to submit any receipts to get the remaining balance back. For simplicity letâ€™s say Iâ€™ve contributed and claimed $2,500.

At my new employer (that also offers a Dependent Care FSA option), can I sign up again to contribute the remaining $2,500?

oizxjs,brethart91,"Does my retirement strategy make sense, or should I change something?

Hi All,

If you get a minute, would you mind looking at my retirement strategy below to see if it makes sense? My goal is to retire in about 15 years at age 50. I've gathered several pieces of advice and tried to bring it all together for my situation, so any advice or changes you could give me would be greatly appreciated.

&amp;#x200B;

**General Information:**

Age: 35

Target Retirement Age: 50

Combined AGI: $185,000

Tax Bracket: 24% (Married Filing Jointly)

Joint yearly expenses in retirement: $80k (or $40k/person)

&amp;#x200B;

**Current Accounts:**

401k: $160k

Traditional IRA (rollover from a past employer's 401k): $25k

Roth IRA: $15k

HSA: negligible amount

&amp;#x200B;

**My Proposed Strategy:**

&amp;#x200B;

***1) Right now: Starting a new job.***

\- I'm planning to choose use a Traditional 401k at my new job (they offer Roth and Traditional).

\- I'm planning to roll in both my current 401k and my Traditional IRA to my new 401k (assuming a good fund selection).

That'll leave me with one 401k (balance: $185k) and one Roth IRA (balance: $15k). No Traditional IRA (to pave the way for a backdoor Roth if I need it).

If I can, I'm planning to use a Target Date Fund for the Traditional 401k and Roth IRA. Something like FIHFX from Fidelity.

***2) Next Fifteen Years: Age 35-50.***

\- I'm planning to max out my Traditional 401k ($19,500), my Roth IRA ($6,000), and HSA ($7,200) each year for as long as my income will allow me.

\- After maxing those three accounts, invest any extra funds in children's 529s and a Taxable Brokerage account.

\- If/when our MAGI exceeds $208k, then open a Traditional IRA and leverage a backdoor Roth strategy (or mega backdoor Roth if my 401k plan allows for in-service distribution to a Roth IRA). Continue to do this instead of a Taxable Brokerage Account because it's tax advantaged and there's no limit(?).

***3a) Retirement (phase 1): Age 50-55.***

\- I'm planning to stop working at 50 and live off of $40k / year ($80k between the two of us) from my Taxable Brokerage Account and/or Roth IRA for 5 years.

\- At the same time, convert $40k / year from my Traditional 401k / IRA (if I rolled it into one) into my Roth IRA and let it season for 5 years (Roth IRA ladder), since my marginal tax bracket should be low.

**3b) Retirement (phase 2): Age 55-60.**

\- I'm planning to start living primarily off of my Roth IRA conversions from the Roth IRA ladder and maybe supplement with the Taxable Brokerage account if necessary.

***3c) Retirement (phase 3): Age 60+.***

\- I'm planning to take distributions from my Traditional 401k / IRA (using the 4% rule) and maybe supplement with Roth IRA, Taxable Brokerage account, and HSA (at age 65), as long as I stay in a low tax bracket.

&amp;#x200B;

**Other notes (not sure if these affect anything):**

\- I have two children, so we're leveraging 529s, a Dependent Care FSA / Child Care Tax Credit, Child Tax Credit.

\- Only debt is the house, which I'm planning to have paid off in the next 8 or so years...

I want to know if this seems rational and makes sense as a strategy as I progress through my career...Are there any holes you can poke in, or is it a fairly solid strategy?

okzqfd,brethart91,"Dependent Care FSA Question

Hi. At my current employer, I elected $5,000 (the maximum at the time) for Dependent Care FSA (DCFSA). It equates to a little over $400 / month that I contribute. However, my daycare expenses accrue at more than 2x that rate...but for simplicity, let's say it's 2x, or $800 / month.

So it's like this:

Jan 21 Daycare: $800, DCFSA: $400

Feb 21 Daycare: $1600, DCFSA: $800

So in March, I submitted a claim for January because that's when I had enough money in my DCFSA to cover a month's worth of daycare (January's).

So I'm always having to wait longer to submit receipts...

Right now, I'm in the process of switching jobs, and that caused me to have two questions:

1) Since I've only contributed a little over half of the $5,000 (around $2,800), at my new employer, can I elect the remaining $2,200? Is that how it works?

1a) Depending on the answer to #1, if the new employer supports the new limit of $10,500 for DCFSA, can I elect what would now be $8,300?

1b) Let's say they don't support the new limit of $10,500 and it's still $5,000....can I elect the full $5,000 again, knowing the total from my last employer and my new employer this year would add up to $7,800 ($2,800 + $5,000)?

&amp;#x200B;

2) Once I'm done with my current employer, I'll need to submit a claim to get the remaining balance in my account...but to do that, I'll only need to get a receipt for services rendered March-April. Will I be able to file a claim with my new DCFSA manager to recoup expenses from May-present (and the rest of the year) or would they only take receipts for expenses incurred while my new DCFSA is active (So July forward)? If it's the latter, then I have no way of claiming expenses from May- mid-July...

Can someone with experience answer some of these questions?

Ok, this is a very dumb question, but I just need validation that I'm thinking about this the right way. I recently switched jobs and I want to max out my 401k for the year. While these aren't exact numbers, they are simple enough for me to illustrate my point. Let's say I contributed $1,000 at my last employer and I make $100,000 at my new employer...

When I go to elect benefits, would I calculate the % for 2021 as follows?

$19,500 (max 401k contribution for 2021)

\- $1,000 (what I've already contributed for the year)

= $18,500

Let's say any benefits I elect this month don't go into effect until the first week of next month (week 31 of the year). I believe would be 22 remaining weeks of the year at that time.

so then $100,000 / 52 = $1,923 per week.

$1,923  x 22 = $42,306 remaining gross earnings for the year once the benefits are active...

\--------

$18,500 / $42,306 = 43.7% the percentage I would use now to ensure I max out my 401k for 2021.

Then, when it's open enrollment time (or maybe just prior to the first of the year?) change the percentage to 19.5% because I would have a full year ahead of me.

I am planning to enroll in a HDHP and HSA at my new employer. My entire family (including me) is covered under my wife's insurance. That's our primary insurance. So this new insurance would be considered my secondary, I suppose. I have a few questions about this situation.

Is it just considered a regular account and it doesn't matter whose plan it's ""attached"" to?

2) If my new employer contributes to my HSA as a perk of sorts, does that contribution count toward the annual family max of $7,200, or is it only the combination of my and my wife's contributions that count toward the limit?

3) I believe HSA contributions can be changed at any time, correct? So if I decide to contribute $1,000 initially but want to change it to $1,500 a month from now, I should be able to do that, correct?

4) Besides HSAs and Dependent Care FSAs, are there any other common ""individual"" accounts whose limits are based on the household or family? I'm trying to make sure I know specifically which accounts I need to coordinate with my wife on during open enrollment so we don't exceed any limits.

If my wife has family HDHP coverage and I have individual HDHP coverage, can I contribute the full $7,200 limit to my HSA and she contribute $0 to hers, despite her being the one with the family coverage? I think we'd both be eligible and the combined amount wouldn't exceed the family limit.

The reason I ask is because my new employer has separate areas for selecting HDHP coverage and HSA account type. In the HSA area, I need to choose ""Individual"" or ""Family"". I know HSAs are only individual, but I think it's so that they can validate the contribution amount I put in the field and error if goes over the max ($3,600 individual, $7,200 family).

So if the answer to my question is ""Yes"" and I can contribute the entire $7,200 despite my having just an individual HDHP plan, then that means I'll have to select the ""Family"" HSA option, which I'm sure would cause some issue (my employer I think would just see a mismatch of an individual HDHP with a family(limit) HSA.

osumuz,brethart91,"Conversion IRA Transfer Question

Many years ago, I had a Traditional 401k with an employer. When I left that company, I transferred those funds into a Rollover IRA (I think also called Conduit IRA) with American Funds. A few years ago, my financial advisor suggested I move it to another financial institution where some of my other accounts (like my Roth IRA) were, which we did.

I've not contributed anything to it since it's been a Rollover IRA either at American Funds or where it is now in case that matters here (how could I anyway? It's pretax money...)

My question is, is it possible that it lost its Rollover/Conduit designation when it was transferred from American Funds to this other institution? I'm concerned that it went from a Rollover (Traditional) to a Traditional without the Rollover distinction. The reason I ask is because I think my new 401k plan accepts roll ins, but only from pre-tax IRAs that were from qualified retirement plans--which I think means Rollover IRAs...

ov719m,brethart91,"What's the best way to compare funds?

Forgive my ignorance, but can someone tell me, if I have Fund A and Fund B, how can I compare them apples to apples?

For example, let's say Fund A has a return of 10% over the past 10 years, and an expense ratio of 0.75%. And let's say Fund B has a return of 9.5% over the past 10 years, and an expense ratio of 0.015%.

Is it that Fund B is a better investment because 9.5% - 0.015% = 9.485%  is a higher net return vs Fund A (which had a higher gross return, but also a higher expense ratio). 10% - 0.75% = 9.25%?

Is it as simple as that, or is it more involved? This all stems from the fact that I have an old 401k where I held multiple different funds with varying expense ratios--ratios that are all higher than my current three-fund portfolio has very low expense ratios.

My new 401k is managed by Fidelity, and they said I would need to personally get a distribution check from the originating institution and then turn around and deposit it with Fidelity within 60 days. Based on what Iâ€™ve read, this is an â€œindirect rolloverâ€ and is subject to 20% withholdingâ€”meaning if I were moving $20k, I would only get $16k and have to come up with $4kâ€¦.then I would get a 1099-R that I would file with my taxes and refund me the $4k?

2) If the answer to #1 is yes, can I do a transfer-in-kind of my Traditional IRA from the originating institution to Fidelity (which I think would be direct), then initiate a roll in from my Fidelity Traditional IRA to my 401k which is managed by Fidelity?

3) Not as important but when my wife rolled her 403b into a 401k, she had to get a check and turn around and deposit it, and I donâ€™t think any amount whatsoever was withheldâ€¦so Iâ€™m not sure if this 20% thing is the reality or not.

Hi, I have a 401k that's managed by institution ""B"". It accepts roll-ins from qualified accounts/plans.

At institution ""A"" I have a Rollover (Traditional) IRA whose funds came from a former employer's 401k many many years ago and a Roth IRA.

My intention is to:

1) Roll the funds from the Rollover IRA at ""A"" into my new 401k at ""B""  
2) Transfer my Roth IRA at ""A"" to a Roth IRA at ""B""

This way, all of my accounts are with institution ""B""

I am trying to work with institution ""A"" to cut a check (FBO my name) so that I can hand it over to institution ""B"" to complete the roll in (this is how it has to happen to go from IRA to 401k). However, they are giving me lots of reasons why they can't issue me the check or why it's a huge to-do.

Rather than trying to work through that headache (for me), I am thinking of just doing an in-kind transfer of my Rollover IRA from ""A"" to ""B"" first (like I am with my Roth), THEN when everything is under the umbrella of institution ""B"", roll the Traditional IRA funds to 401k and close the traditional IRA account.

The difference is that the transfer of IRA to IRA first won't require me to make any more phone calls or get a check. I would just initiate the transfer online and Institution ""B"" would somehow facilitate the transfer. At least that gets the money out of institution ""A""

However, I think that uses up my twelve-month quota of IRA to IRA transfers, correct? If so, would doing that then prevent me from transferring my Roth IRA, or is it once every twelve months per IRA type?

My employer contributes an amount each paycheck to my HSA. I know employer contributions count toward the max, so I have my contributions set accordingly so that Iâ€™ll have contributed the max amount by the end of the year.

Due to a miscommunication, theyâ€™ve actually been contributing more than they shouldâ€™ve (my contributions are based on this higher amountâ€”so together itâ€™s not over the max).

To correct this, they said they would simply contact Fidelity to reverse the overage theyâ€™ve contributed, but:

1) I have all of my HSA money invested, and Fidelity apparently told them they canâ€™t reverse the overageâ€”I think until I sell some of my (one) fundâ€”and get that amount they plan to reverse in the Cash account.

Thatâ€™s fineâ€”I donâ€™t see why I shouldnâ€™t be able to do that, except

2) Theyâ€™re looking to reverse the exact amount of overage theyâ€™ve contributed. Does that seem correct? For several months that money has been invested and earning/losing money. Wouldnâ€™t that also need to be considered in the reversal?

3) Once this is all settled, I plan to adjust (increase) my contributions to make up the difference so that I still contribute the max.

Car insurance has already been called, it was towed to an auto shop that car insurance told us to get it towed to and it's 13k in damage.","Loss Aversion, Sunk Cost Fallacy, Recency Bias","The statement exhibits several biases. Loss Aversion is present as the owner is emotionally attached to the car, mentioning it was purchased right before COVID price increases, indicating a sense of loss if the car is totaled. The Sunk Cost Fallacy is also evident as the owner is considering the $3k left on the loan and possibly the price they could have gotten for the car before COVID, influencing their decision. Additionally, Recency Bias is observed as the owner is reacting strongly to the recent car accident and the high damage cost of $13k, which might be influencing their urgency to make a decision.","The user tends to make emotionally-driven financial decisions influenced by recent events, past investments, and a reluctance to let go of possessions, indicating a bias towards loss aversion, sunk cost fallacy, and recency bias."

My mom was in an accident yesterday (she's fine), but the car (2017 Corolla) was a total loss.

Seeing APRs of 6%-7% for car loans (3.99% and 4.99% if financing directly through Toyota) - anyone know of places offering anything for less (credit union in our area is doing 7.2% vs. Bank of America at 6.29% new/6.7% used)","Loss Aversion, Framing Effect, Present Bias, Anchoring","The user's decision-making process appears to be influenced by several biases. Loss Aversion is evident as the user is considering buying a new car instead of a used one, possibly to avoid the ""loss"" of having a used car. The Framing Effect is also present, as the user frames the decision in terms of the car's value (e.g., $4k left on the loan, $15-17k selling price) and interest rates, which might lead them to focus on the immediate costs rather than long-term benefits. Additionally, Present Bias is likely influencing the user's decision, as they seem to prioritize short-term gains (e.g., lower APRs) over long-term considerations. Lastly, Anchoring is observed as the user uses the MSRP of the new Corolla ($22.7k) as a reference point, which might make the used car prices seem more attractive by comparison.","The user exhibits a tendency to prioritize short-term gains and avoid losses, while being influenced by the framing of financial information and reference points, indicating a present-focused and loss-averse decision-making approach."

r1yiiv,bros402,"ABLE Act Account Question

So I am disabled - have been since I was born. Currently, my parents are looking into ABLE Act accounts (I am 99% sure I told them about it when it was signed into law - but I guess they forgot to set one up?) and they asked me to look into it today.



I am seeing that Fidelity allows ABLE Act accounts to be set up regardless of state (The Fidelity account is based in MA). It also allows you to invest the funds in the account - if I were to set it up, I imagine my parents would be able to put in around ~3-5k to start it up, then kick around that every year for a few more years.


So, if they were to set this up sometime soon, how much would you recommend be kept in cash and how much invested? I was thinking their 50, 60, 70, or 85% portfolio while my parents are still here (then switch it to a 20 or 30%) - I live in a HCOL state (NJ) - with property taxes around 7000 a year (That is where the property taxes should be frozen under NJ's senior freeze program).


They are also thinking of setting up a special needs trust for life insurance and other monies (pension) to go to (Would this be a good idea?). They aren't planning on anything happening to them soon, but their financial advisor has been trying to convince them to go to someone to get one set up for a few years now and they are finally listening, since we've been researching the Disabled Adult Children regulations.

NJ also has an ABLE Act account through Fifth Third - I do not know if it would be better than Fidelity's - or if another states might be better. Here is a link to NJ's - https://savewithable.com/nj/home.html

My situation: I'm 31, parents are 67 and 57, my dad is going to start collecting SSI for old age in 1-2 years (so I can start medicare before my mom retires), and they are planning on being around for a while - the house is paid off, so when they go, I will only have to pay homeowners and property taxes (homeowners is usually around 1.5k a year, property taxes around 6.5k).

Hey guys I have until October 20 +30 days after that to get a return on a defective 28mph $800 scooter. It stops and goes and unreliable. Some days it takes me an hour to go to work 8 Miles away. Other days it takes me 35 mins. 

Currently $3000 cash on hand. 

I get paid roughly $2000 after taxes every 2 weeks if I make sales. I work 2 jobs at 61 hours a week. My rent is roughly $1100 with utilities. Not counting food expenses which I work at a restaurant which I could save money. 

My first job is 2 miles from my house that I get to at 8 am to 12 pm. Restaurant. 

Then I leave at 12 pm for my second job that starts at 1 pm at 4.5 miles away that ends at 10 pm. Sales gym job. 

So this is ideal because my house room rental is 7.5 miles away from my second job. 

The issue is that if I return the scooter now itâ€™s going to cost me about $60 in Uber rides each day. Thereâ€™s no metro bus transit after 10 pm. In between the 12 pm and 1 pm thereâ€™s no bus that takes 2 hours to get to the gym job. 

One of the jobs have to be put on hold or I would need to Uber to upkeep both jobs. If I Uber thatâ€™s $60 hours of wage lost about 6 hours of work. So why work 2 jobs when my hours at the job is lost. 

So the solution is the following. 

1. get a used car under $3000 or $5,000 next month - I donâ€™t know how to maintain or fix car. If I spend it here thereâ€™s no guarantee over the Craigslist or marketplace 
2. Get a car lease

I donâ€™t want to justify buying a brand new car but used cars are just so damn expensive nowadays.  Seems like the average used car between 10k-15k is 8-10 years old with 80k-150k miles on it.

On the financial Iâ€™m a saver and stubbornly frugal.  I can afford the new Toyota Camry, but Iâ€™m not sure I want to spend that much on a car.  On the flip side used car prices are really high and you canâ€™t really get much of a car for 10-15k.

Expensive COL area in Southern California.  Our realistic first home options are either a 3br condo or a 3br townhouse, each are in the $600k-700k price range current market.  We've saved up $104,500 towards a downpayment.  I'm able to save about $17k to $20k per year towards the downpayment.

Our rent for a 2br condo is currently $2200/mo, but we're expecting a 5-10% increase every year going forward based on the market trend.  I'd rather be building equity so we can retire in a home that we own and not be at the mercy of a landlord and potential rent increases.

Weâ€™re currently renting a 2bed 2ba condo for $2200/mo, which is lower than the current market rate of about $2700-2800/mo. Our lease ends in three months and the landlord wants to increase rent by $250/mo with a one-year extension or $200/mo with a two-year extension. Weâ€™re at the point where we want to have a child, so weâ€™d like to get a 3 bedroom place. My stepdaughter occupies the second room.  We don't want to put off having a child for much longer, as we're approaching our mid-30's.

Three-bedroom rentals are going for about $3500/mo. A nice townhouse in my area is going for about $800k. We have $102k to put towards a down payment, which will bring our full-boat monthly payment to about $4200-4400/mo. We plan on renting out the third room in the new townhouse for $900-1000/mo. 

Iâ€™m really struggling with the idea of having a $4200-4400/mo payment.

I've been called in (his daughter) to pick up the pieces.  He residents in Nevada and that's also where the stroke happened.  Stroke occurred during sleep.  Moderate stroke, led to a 4-day hospital stay at a County-run hospital where an MRI and numerous echos were conducted.  My dad is doing pretty well and is slowly getting back into work, but I can tell there's some residual confusion/disorientation.  He's probably 90-95% functional (based on me hanging out with him for a day or two).

My first goal here is to get him insured.  The hospital gave him two different paperwork packets.  The first is a Medicaid application.  The second is a charity care application.  According to the hospital, individuals must make $1483 or less per month to qualify for Medicaid.  My father is a sole proprietor, so he purposely keeps tabs on everything to ensure his reportable income remains as low as possible.  However, his income can fluctuate wildly though.  One month, he may make $10,000, the next month, $500.  How does this work with Medicaid?  Does some one have continuously apply and verify throughout the year?

**Paying Bills Soon to Accumulate**

Bills have not yet arrived, but we're preparing for some whoppers.  Hospital already offering a ""30% discount"" because he is considered ""cash pay.""  If he is approved for Medicaid, will Medicaid help pay for the hospital stay that already occurred retroactively?  What about if I get him signed up through the ACA exchange within the week?

One step child (my wife's child who has a 50/50 custody arrangement with the father).  I'd like to protect my wife financially when I die in general, but more specifcally, the house, as she cannot make the mortgage payment on her own over a long period of time.

33 year old male, healthy, working a full-time office job.  I have a congenital heart condition that definitely makes me a risk for life insurance providers. My prognosis is good, but I'm definitely in a high risk group relative to the general population. Iâ€™m trying to find a policy that will cover me so that my wife will not lose our mortgaged home if I die. I am the primary breadwinner and weâ€™re in a high cost of living area.  Iâ€™ve tried to find typical life insurance through two different brokers and even tried on my own online with no luck. I now have a broker that says we should submit an application and just try to get through underwriting to get a mortgage-only life insurance policy. The policy will just cover the remainder of the mortgage balance if I pass away. Part of the application process will be a medical records review.

I currently receive basic life insurance through my work, which is one-years salary payable on death. Last year, I tried to add coverage onto that policy, but was denied. I had to fill out a form that required me to check the box for heart conditions and thatâ€™s why I think I was denied. I could not find out any more information from my workâ€™s HR department.

Question: is there any reason why I shouldnâ€™t go for the life insurance that just covers the mortgage balance and submit to a medical records review?

Jerry retired on January 1st, 2000 with One Million Dollars in his 401K and used the 4% rule so his first annual withdrawal was $40,000.  Each year he adjusted his annual withdrawal up by the rate of inflation. On December 31, 2008, he only had  $403,770 left and he was now taking out 12% of his balance due to annual inflation increases based on the 4% rule.

His friend Chris decided to be more conservative and went 50% a total bond and 50% total stock. On December 31, 2008, he had $910,454 left and was taking out 5.49% of his portfolio out in withdrawals.

The stock market would keep dropping a few more months and as far as anyone knew, it could go down even further.

Jerry's greed going with a 100% stock portfolio caused him many nights of fear and sleepless nights. By 2009 his health was so bad by the stress he had a massive heart attack.

Chris is still doing well today with a portfolio worth $1.4 million.","Loss Aversion, Overconfidence, Regret Aversion, Affect Heuristic, Sunk Cost Fallacy, Present Bias","The statement reveals several biases in Jerry's decision-making process.

Jerry's experience of significant portfolio depletion and stress-induced health issues seems to have been influenced by loss aversion, as he faced substantial losses. Regret aversion may have played a role in Jerry's initial decision, as he may have regretted not being more conservative. The affect heuristic is evident in Jerry's emotional response to his investment performance, which negatively impacted his health.

We enter a recession and his growth mutual fund has crashed 50% and now is valued at $25.00 a share. Doug is retired and needs to pay his bills and takes 4% out of his investment portfolio every year. He sells 4% of his mutual fund that dropped 50% and is now selling at $25.00 a share.  After his withdrawal, he has lost 54% of his investment portfolio.

Mark owns a high yield stock mutual fund that also dropped 50% during the bear market. His high yield mutual fund has a 4% yield. The dividend is paid once a year every December. Mark pays his retirement bills with the 4% annual distribution from the dividend of his mutual fund.  Mark feels like a genius because he lives on dividends and does not touch the principal.  After spending the 4% dividend he still has the same number of shares he had before. I told him he is no better off than Doug because on the ex-dividend day the value of his stock dropped an equal amount of the dividend.

Jerry retired at age 62 but does not need his Social Security checks.  (He has a nice pension and investments.)   But he still decides to start collecting benefits starting at age 62 and invests the money.  in a 60-40 mutual fund. His first Social Security check is about $1500 a month which increases each year by the rate of inflation (1-3% a year)

On his 70th Birthday, he has about $220K in his investment account from deposits and capital gains from his invested Social Security Checks.

His twin brother Ben also decided to retire at age 62 but won't collect SS until he is 70. Ben was proud to say his SS checks will be almost twice the amount of his twin brother Jerry because he waited to 70 to collect. (Even though they had about the same lifetime income.)

Jerry- who collected SS at age 62-  decided to challenge Ben to a contest. Starting at age 70 he would withdraw from his $220K nest egg the difference between their Social Security checks so they both were given the same amount of money per month. AGAIN, Jerry would withdraw about $1500 a month out of his $220K nest egg he got from investing his smaller SS checks for 8 years so he would have the same income as Ben. (Social Security check + $1500 a month will match Ben's larger SS payment.)  The ending date of the contest is age 90.

Jerry insists because he started the contest with $220K, he can live into his 90s and still come out ahead because he will still be earning investment returns from his initial nest egg.

Growth Small Company stocks are more volatile than large blue chips

Consumer Staple Stocks are less volatile than NASDAQ Technology Stocks in a bear market

If Stocks crash in a bear market they go back up within a few years (Every bear market has had a recovery.)

If the economy continues to grow the stock market long term trend will be up.

Your observations.","Confirmation Bias, Recency Bias, Affect Heuristic","The statement exhibits Confirmation Bias as the user seems to be seeking validation for their observation that dividend stocks don't provide protection during a market crash, which contradicts the common narrative. The user's analysis of ETFs with growing dividend yields vs. growth stocks with no dividends and finding no difference this week also indicates Recency Bias, as they are generalizing from a single week's data. Furthermore, the user's tone and language (""HEY!"", ""basically there was no difference"") suggest an emotional response, which is characteristic of the Affect Heuristic, where decisions are influenced by immediate emotions rather than a thorough analysis.","The user exhibits a tendency to seek confirming evidence, overreact to recent data, and make emotionally-driven decisions."
fchtku,chargum,"In a Bear Market, it is much better to break your investments in separate total stock and total bond funds than use balanced mutual funds in retirement

I want to show you the math behind the advantages of having separate total stock and total bond funds vs using balanced mutual funds.

Jim retired on October 1st, 2007 and had 2 Million Dollars in his 401K retirement account and is using the 4% rule and is planning on withdrawing a starting figure of $6666 a month which will be adjusted for inflation. He has two accounts 60% of his money is in a total stock market fund and 40% in a total bond market fund. Just when he retires the stock market starts to crash so he pulls his $6666 a month withdrawal out of his bond fund so he does not sell his stocks when they are down. On March 1, 2009, just before the stock market hits bottom he has $955,736 in his total Bond Fund and $519,680 in his total stock market fund. ($1,475,416 combined) Starting in March 2009 he took his monthly withdrawals equally from both funds. On February 2020 he has $2,598,449 left.

Peter also retired on October 2007 and had $2 Million in retirement and put it all in a 60-40 Mutual Fund. On March 1st he had $1,164,377 in his Balanced 60-40 Mutual Fund (FBALX) He took an inflation-adjusted starting amount of $6666.00 a month out of that fund from October 2007 to February 2020. So, in the end, on February 2020 he had $2,489,195 left.

Why the difference? Because Peter used a balanced mutual fund that was selling stocks during the Great Recession (due to the investment having 60% in stocks). While Jim only withdrew from his bond funds during the 2007-2009 stock market crash.

[https://www.portfoliovisualizer.com/backtest-portfolio#analysisResults](https://www.portfoliovisualizer.com/backtest-portfolio#analysisResults)","Confirmation Bias, Anchoring, Status Quo Bias, Framing Effect","The statement presents a comparison between two retirement scenarios, one using separate total stock and total bond funds, and the other using a balanced mutual fund. The author highlights the benefits of the former approach, citing a specific example where Jim's portfolio outperforms Peter's. The use of a website to verify the calculations seems to add credibility to the argument. However, upon closer inspection, it appears that the author is selectively presenting information to support their pre-existing view, which is a hallmark of Confirmation Bias. Additionally, the author anchors the discussion by starting with a specific example that supports their claim, rather than presenting a more balanced view. The emphasis on the benefits of separating stock and bond funds also suggests a Status Quo Bias, where the author is promoting a particular investment strategy as the default or preferred option. Furthermore, the framing of the comparison, highlighting the difference in outcomes, is an example of the Framing Effect, where the author is influencing the reader's perception by selectively presenting information.","The user exhibits a biasing behavior characterized by selectively presenting information to support a pre-existing investment strategy, anchoring on specific examples, and framing the discussion to promote a particular view."
