13e1mak,JMRooDukes808,"If you expect to make more than the Roth IRA income limits in the future, should you avoid rolling over a 401k to a tIRA?

This question is purely hypothetical since I still make well below the income limits after maxing my 401k. However, I expect my income (or HHI) to eventually exceed the limit.

When looking at a back door Roth IRA as an option, it seems simple enough to contribute to a tIRA then immediately convert to Roth, but the â€œpro-rataâ€ rule is where I get confused. It seems like you should only do a back door Roth if you donâ€™t already have money in a tIRA in order to avoid a larger tax bill, so does that mean if I left my current job it would be advised to keep my 401k as it is (or roll to new 401k) vs converting to a tIRA?

My fund choices in my current 401k are pretty good so the decision would strictly be related to future back door Roth conversions rather than needing better fund choices.","Status Quo Bias, Loss Aversion","The statement reveals a cautious approach to rolling over a 401k to a traditional IRA (tIRA), primarily due to concerns about future backdoor Roth IRA conversions and the pro-rata rule. This caution suggests a preference for maintaining the current state, which is indicative of Status Quo Bias. The individual is hesitant to change their current situation (keeping the 401k as is or rolling it to a new 401k) to avoid potential tax implications, even if it might not be the optimal choice. Additionally, the fear of a ""larger tax bill"" implies a loss aversion mindset, where the potential downside (increased taxes) is weighed more heavily than potential benefits (e.g., more flexible investment options).","The user exhibits a tendency to favor the current state and avoid potential losses, as evidenced by their cautious approach to rolling over a 401k to a tIRA, driven by concerns about tax implications and a preference for maintaining the status quo."
13vp4zm,JMRooDukes808,"Wedding vendor accidentally charged me $13k and maxed out my card. Can I do anything about it today?

This is for a Capital One Venture card.So my wedding is this weekend and I had to make the last payment for catering. I filled out a CC authorization form last week and told them they could charge my card on the 29th for about $6400 when it was due. I woke up this morning to an email saying there was an â€œerror in their point of sale system and you might see a pending transaction that will be dropped after midnight tonight. We were able to immediately void the transaction, etc etcâ€ 

Well that pending charge is for $12,800 in addition to the correct $6400 charge, so now the card is maxed out. I suspect I wonâ€™t be able to use it until at least Thursday when the pending transactions clear. If I call Capital One to explain the situation, will they be able to remove the pending charge early?

Edit: sounds like Iâ€™m SOL

Edit: this question is solely around the credit card limit. Advice about not financing your wedding on a credit card is not welcome because that is not the situation. No I do not have another credit card to use. Yes I can use cash or debit, but again thatâ€™s not the question.

Edit: thank you to everyone who offered advice. I called capital one today and spoke to 4 different people after the charge was still there this morning. Even though I have a receipt for the voided transaction from the vendor, they were unable to 1) give me a permanent credit line increase, 2) give me a temporary credit line increase, 3) mark the transaction as fraud or disputed, or 4) give me the credit back for the charge before it gets dropped off. I also made a $5000+ payment this morning, but because the charge put me so far above my limit, I only got $147 in available credit back. 

I also applied for a chase card last night and that is pending review so there is literally nothing that can be done today by capital one, the vendor, or myself.

15k03es,JMRooDukes808,"How important is it to pay off debt before buying first home?

My wife and I (ages 28 and 29) just got married this year and Iâ€™m mapping out our 2024 expected income/budget/expenses and our debt. Our HHI is roughly $200k depending on commissions (both of us are in commission jobs but I have a pretty high base + guaranteed commission).

Our biggest goal is to save for our first house, probably to be purchased in 3-4 years as weâ€™re moving to a new city at the end of this year, and plan on renting there for max 2 years while we figure out where we want to live long term. 

My initial thought was to pay off all our debts before we buy the home if possible, which Iâ€™m confident we can do but the question is really how important is debt to income ratio when buying your first home? 

I have $13k in student loans (avg 3.97%), and my wife has $30k in student loans roughly the same interest rate. The total amount is spread across about 15 loans. 

Which brings me to the ultimate question - would it be better to pay off the student loans aggressively before saving up a down payment? I know that the general consensus is that loans under 4% can be paid off over time since you can get better returns in the market, but thatâ€™s not really our goal in the short term because we will already be saving about $40k in retirement funds per year.","Loss Aversion, Framing Effect, Present Bias","The statement reveals several biases.

Iâ€™m a 25yo male and have never had a credit card. My income is about $78k/year and I am good at tracking all of my expenses. I have a spreadsheet where I track my biweekly income, payments that I have to make towards bills, rent, insurance, student loans, etc. and I also contribute 10% of my income to my 401k and am building up my emergency fund. I think itâ€™s time for me to get a credit card to take advantage of the miles/points that I can get with my spending, in addition to building my credit history beyond just my student loans. 

Outside of the essential payments, I spend about $600-$700 every 2 weeks on what I consider â€œflexâ€ spending - groceries, gas, eating out, bars, concert tickets, basically anything that is not rent or a bill.

When considering a credit card, I know that I must pay it off every single month in full and never have a balance, which I plan on doing. My question is - can (or should) I pay off my credit card balance every 2 weeks instead of every month? I think this would be easier for me based on how I track my expenses (per pay period vs per month).

gg2b97,JMRooDukes808,"Why savings goals are important and my personal finance journey

Iâ€™ll start by saying I know none of you care about these details at all, but I the reason I started making personal finance a hobby revolves around a goal I never had before and turned into something beautiful. If it can help just one person on this sub, it wasnâ€™t a waste of time.

Iâ€™m a 25 year old male who graduated in December of 2017 with a degree in Energy. Landed a job in tech sales as an SDR out of college, making my degree basically worthless, and making roughly $55k/year in a HCOL area (northern Virginia). 

When I graduated and started making money, I never had a second thought about my finances because I knew I could easily afford all my bills every month and thought that was all thatâ€™s important. That was until July 2018 when my favorite DJ announced a destination music festival in Mexico that I knew I couldnâ€™t miss, happening in Feb/Mar â€˜19 and would cost about $5000 total between me and my gf. 

This caused me to manually build a spreadsheet mapping out my projected income and expenses for the next 6 months since I was paying for the trip on a payment plan to see if I could really afford it. Even though my gf and I really struggled by not being able to go to bars and shows like normal, this ended up being a huge blessing since it was the first step in the prime directive before I ever knew about this sub or anything related to PF. 

From there, I realized how important it was to always have specific goals in mind when dealing with money. Even if itâ€™s retirement thatâ€™s 40 years from now, the time to plan is now. Every dollar you get, PAY YOURSELF FIRST. Without this random music festival popping up in my life and forcing me to take a deep dive into my finances, I never would be where I am today with a solid e-fund, plans to pay off $20k in student loans by the end of 2021, and retirement/wedding/house goals in mind.

2. Vested time. Some companies have a vested time period where the â€œfree moneyâ€ isnâ€™t actually yours till a certain number of years. What if you leave the company or are laid off. Well there goes your â€œfree moneyâ€ guys. No such thing as a free lunch. 

3. Hidden maintenance fees that are not really visible to you unless you go looking for it. Trust me, Iâ€™ve done it myself. 

4. If you pull out money from 401k after 59.5, yes you will not pay a penalty anymore BUT if you are in a higher tax bracket than you thought youâ€™d be, then you will be paying hella taxes anyways with potentially measly returns on top of that. 

5. Flexibility in investments is important to me. I should be free to invest any stock, index fund, or etf I want. What if I donâ€™t like the target date funds or the mutual funds provided? Why should I be forced to invest in something I am not comfortable with?

We have been fortunate to have gotten free childcare from relatives during Covid.  Two kids will be entering daycare in late 2020/early 2021 however and we are likely to have a 3rd kid in the not too distant future.

Anyways, my basic plan is to try to get like $50,000 in dividend paying stocks, knowing that I will have less money available to invest for the foreseeable future, at least until I am done paying for daycare.  $50k in stocks at 5% yield pays out $208 per month.  That way even if itâ€™s just $150 every two weeks that I can afford to invest going forward, I will still average adding $500+ per month into the stock account and will have that to play with.

g416eb,Just-A-Random-Guy-92,"In-service 401k to Roth IRA Rollovers

Hi, everyone.

I'm sitting here tonight, a little less than halfway through the education portion of studying for my CFP. Taking a night off, but finance and planning are still on my mind. And I was wondering why more people don't take advantage of in-service 401k rollovers to get around the annual Roth IRA contribution limits. Assuming they're eligible for Roth contributions, of course. 

You can only contribute $6,000 per year if you're under 50, but if you're able to shove $19,000 into your 401k every year you can rollover that over and end up with more than $6,000 in your Roth every year. It obviously depends on your tax bracket, but you've already paid OASDI and Medicare taxes on your 401k contributions, so all you'd owe is federal and state taxes. Combined, you'd have to have an effective tax rate of something like 73% to get you all the way down to $6,000 from $19,000 plus employer match. 

Why don't people do this? Even if you paid 35% in federal and state taxes, you'd still end up with something like $14,500 in your Roth IRA every year, more than double what you'd be able to contribute otherwise.","Overconfidence, Confirmation Bias, Affect Heuristic","The writer appears to exhibit Overconfidence due to their assumption that the in-service 401k rollover strategy is optimal for everyone, disregarding individual circumstances such as tax brackets and financial goals. They also display Confirmation Bias by selectively presenting a one-sided argument in favor of the strategy, focusing on the potential benefits while downplaying potential drawbacks. Furthermore, the writer's enthusiasm and rhetorical questioning (""Why don't people do this?"") suggest an Affect Heuristic, where their emotional response to the idea of exploiting a loophole is influencing their judgment, leading them to oversimplify the issue and assume universal applicability.","The user tends to exhibit biases that lead them to overestimate their knowledge, selectively seek confirming information, and make decisions based on emotional appeals rather than nuanced analysis."
g4abi7,Just-A-Random-Guy-92,"Confidence as a Financial Advisor

Hi, everyone. I just had a quick question for anyone here who who's a financial advisor and/or CFPÂ® Professional.

I am currently 27 years old (28 next month) and I graduated from college in 2014 with a BS degree. I worked in pharmacy for four years, three years in retail and one year in inpatient, and in 2019, for reasons I won't go into, I lost my job at the hospital. At that point I decided I wanted to move on to something new, different, and hopefully better.

I had been managing my own finances for a few years at that  point. I'd been in the market for two years. I would always talk to coworkers about stocks and the market, etc. and they would encourage me to pursue a career in the industry.

Well, I got that chance in 2019. I was hired last March to work at a small RIA. And when I say small, I mean small. It's just me and my boss, with 20 clients or so and AUM of $10M. I started off doing mostly back office work, but have met all our clients face to face and essentially act as a client liaison. I suppose some people would call me a relationship manager...

Anyway, I passed my series 65 in October of 2019 and am now studying for my CFP. I am pushing through the Kaplan coursework at a good pace and I am excited at the prospects of earning the marks, increasing my knowledge, increasing my earning power, etc. But it is a lot of information and sometimes I'm not confident I'll be able to retain it all.

I envision myself, in the future, working for a larger RIA with hundreds of millions or billions under management, or even working on my own and building my own practice. And I guess my question is this...

How long did it take you to feel comfortable and confident as a senior advisor or equivalent? As someone in charge who was actually planning, analyzing, and making calls for clients? I'm a career changer, only been around for a year or so. I love learning and helping others learn about their finances, but I'm not confident I could sit down with a client and assess their insurance needs and their ISOs or NQSOs and tell them all about how different types of charitable donations are taxed without having to reference my book.

I'm rambling, but I'll stop now. Sorry for the long post. Just looking for some guidance. Thanks, y'all.","Overconfidence, Self-Attribution Bias, Present Bias","The writer of the statement displays Overconfidence as they express their ambitious career goals, envisioning themselves working for a larger RIA or building their own practice, despite having only been in the industry for a year.

gina4s,Just-A-Random-Guy-92,"I Have A New Job Offer

Hi, everyone. I am going for an interview tomorrow! I do currently have a job. However, it is in an entry level position and pays minimum wage ($13 per hour) in a high cost of living area. I am college-edicated, have earned an important certification since I began working at my current job fourteen months ago and I am actively pursuing another highly regarded industry certification.

I have my hands in a little of everything, given that the company is just my boss and me (a small LLC). But most of my duties are administrative. Billing, invoicing, filing, etc. But I also create documents for clients, collect data, onboard them, send them forms they need, sit in on meetings and record the minutes, troubleshoot technology issues, help to ensure compliance, etc. Needless to say, my knowledge in the field is rapidly growing. 

I am already grossly underpaid, but when I was hired I really needed the money, so I took what I could get (I also came from a completely different industry and thus had no experience a year ago). 

The new job says starting salary is $40,000-45,000, equivalent to $19.23 to $21.63 per hour. But the person I've been in contact with says I will likely start closer to the $15-16 per hour range and be rapidly promoted to closer to $20 after an as yet undetermined probationary period, although an official offer has not been made. The average salary for an administrative assistant in my area ranges from about $39,000-$48,000. My title at the new company would be something like Client Services Administrator. I feel that with my additional knowledge above and beyond the basics of office administration, I should be paid more.

My question is this: Given the fact that I am only making $13 per hour currently, how hard should I negotiate for a higher salary right off the bat? Should I take the likely initial $15-16 per hour and be happy when I get $19 or $20 per hour in a few months? Or should I go in and tell them the average salary of administrative assistants in the area and hope they at least meet that upfront? I don't think I'd be greedy asking for $19.25 per hour ($40,000) upfront, but I also don't want to turn them off. I've never been in a position to negotiate before and I feel like I have some leverage because the offer to interview came completely unsolicited.","Anchoring, Status Quo Bias, Present Bias","The statement exhibits several biases.

gmohxg,Just-A-Random-Guy-92,"Invest or Pay Off Debt?

I will be starting a new job soon that has great growth prospects and will pay much better than the job I will continue with until the end of June (due to my employer having received a payroll protection loan).

From what I've been told, there will be a probationary period where I will be making $16 an hour. This is in contrast to what I'm making now ($13 an hour, minimum wage in my county). This means that I will start out making $250 more per month after taxes. And it would be more than that, but I am electing additional withholding due to the fact that I did a Roth conversion earlier this year and I'm not making estimated tax payments 

After the probationary period, I could be making $18-20. And, yes, I will be sure to get that in writing. But I've been told by other employees that the boss is very good about regular raises. If I make $18 an hour, that would give me $720 more per month after taxes, including additional withholding. If I make $20 an hour, that would give me $875 more after taxes, including additional withholding. This also takes into account the extra I'll have to pay on student loans and health insurance (REPAYE and subsidized health insurance through the state marketplace), a slightly increased food budget, and the fact that by the time I'm making $18-20 an hour, I should no longer be paying for my courses ($680 per course, each one taking me about a month to complete). 

I'm 28, with $22,000 in my Roth. I have $35,000 in student loans at 5.62% and a $16,200 auto loan at 5.94%.

If I put all the extra money toward my auto loan I could pay it off by the end of 2021 or early 2022. I would then roll the free cash from not making auto payments into student loan payments. And even with the increased balance from interest accrual, I could pay them all off in three to four years. Then the only debt I'd have is the mortgage or rent I take on (I don't currently pay for housing). I understand rent isn't debt, but you know what I mean... 

All this being said, I used to absolutely shovel cash into my Roth and haven't been doing so for the past year or so due to the fact that my online classes take up a majority of my discretionary income. I'm young and I really want to take advantage of time being on my side, compound growth and all. But paying off my car and student loans would free up a a few hundred bucks a month at least, and I should be making even more than $20 and hour in a few years (hopefully closer to $25). Although, I do hope to eventually start my own business and those usually aren't profitable for at least a few years. So we'll see how that goes.

Anyway, it seems like now could be a good time to really start focusing on paying down debt. What would you do in my shoes? Pay down the debt? Invest and hope I can get a higher return than my interest rate on the debt? Or perhaps split my extra earned income between the two?","Present Bias, Mental Accounting, Affect Heuristic","The statement exhibits several biases.

I have subsidized health insurance. For the first few months of the year, I underestimated my income for the year. This is because I completed a $4,000 Roth conversion at the beginning of March. That obviously counts as income. I increased my estimated income by the $4,000 and that decreased the subsidy I get each month, but the underpayment (or over-subsidization) for January and February will need to be repaid come tax time next year.

Now, I'm likely getting a new job at the end of June or beginning of July. I'll be getting a substantial raise. Starting at 23% more than I'm making now and possibly making 54% more by the end of the year after a probationary period.

This change in income will substantially decrease the monthly subsidy I get. And if you take all the income from the job I have now, the job I'll have in a month or so, and my Roth conversion, I'd need to start paying thr full cost of my insurance starting in June to avoid total underpayment for the year. I'd like to avoid having to pay that next April.

However I can't go in and delete my current job and add my next job yet. That just screws with things. So what should I do? Should I just withhold more in taxes?

gpeohp,Just-A-Random-Guy-92,"Lifestyle Drift

I am starting to be (or will soon be) doing a little better financially. My stimulus check really helped bolster my bank account and my expenses have gone down since everything has been shut down (whether you think the shutdown is a good or bad thing should be reserved for another reddit post).

On top of that, not only am I still working and earning income... I will be getting a new job at the end of June or the beginning of July that will pay me at least 15% more than I'm currently making. There is also the opportunity for extremely rapid raises (I could be making 54% more than my current wages by the end of the year). Obviously, it's not smart to act as if I'm making 54% more until I actually am. But my point is that I'll be making significantly more than I am now very soon. This is all in addition to 14 days of unused vacation that will be paid out to me when I leave my current employer. That will likely all go to savings. 

All this being said, there have been some things I've been thinking about doing or purchasing that I feel would benefit me. For example, I'd like to buy a top of the line Sonicare toothbrush. Maybe a Waterpik as well. That's a few hundred bucks. My oral hygiene isn't horrible, but it could use some work. And I would consider this a long term investment in myself and in my health. An ounce of prevention goes a long way.

I've also been thinking about giving myself a monthly book allowance. I haven't read a book all the way through in a very long time and that makes me sad. I'd probably focus on classics to begin with: The Wealth of Nations, Leviathan, Treatises on Government by John Locke and political writings by Rousseau. But I feel that reading anything, even fiction, is beneficial to pretty much everyone.

Finally, I've been thinking I might like to celebrate the new job with a nice bottle or two of single malt scotch. Something along the lines of Ardbeg or Laphroaig. Talisker... 

Anyway, I am very conscious, and somewhat terrified, of lifestyle drift. Just because I am making more does not mean I should spend more. And I guess the question I'm sort of asking here is... When do I give myself a break and let myself have something I want? And when do I hold back and keep pushing?

I can afford to make extra car loan payments beginning next year because I won't have to withhold any extra on my taxes anymore. I'm currently withholding a few extra hundred dollars per month to make up for underpayment of subsidized health insurance premiums (based on income) during the first half of the year as well as to cover taxes for a Roth conversion I did in March.

ktzghh,Just-A-Random-Guy-92,"The Saver's Credit - A Quirky Income Problem

Hi, everyone. I'll get right into it and try to keep this relatively short.

For tax year 2020, the maximum saver's credit I can get is $200 (10% of a maximum contribution to a qualified retirement account of $2,000), subject to an AGI limit of $33,000. In 2020, I will have made about $31,000 in earned income (wages). However, I also performed a Roth conversion in March. The total distribution was just over $4,000 and I have no other deductions, apart from paltry student loan interest (which I didn't even really get this year since all my loans have been in forbearance). My traditional IRA is now empty. 

So... My AGI is a few thousand over the limit for earning the saver's credit. However, I was wondering if I could (or if it would be prudent to) make a backdoor Roth contribution. I am in a somewhat unique situation here where my income allows me to make fully deductible IRA contributions and also contribute to a Roth IRA. However... I made too much to earn the saver's credit, which is essentially a free $200. And this will likely be the last year I can earn it.

So my thinking is that I would make a contribution of approximately $2,000-2,500 to my traditional IRA with after-tax dollars, deduct that on my taxes so that I would meet the AGI limit for the saver's credit, and then convert the monies to my Roth IRA. I should be able to deduct the traditional contribution because the money going in is after-tax... The only issue (and it's a big issue that might make this whole thing untenable or at least stupid to begin with) is that if I did this, because I deducted my contributions to lower my AGI, I would have to turn right around and pay tax again on the conversion. On $2,000, effective federal and state taxes in my bracket would probably come to something like 15% or $300. That would mean my net ""profit"" from this whole exercise would be negative one hundred dollars. Of course, I realize that not qualifying for the saver's credit is a good thing because eit means I made more money. But that $4,000 conversion wasn't really usable, earned wages. So I'll feel a bit cheated if I can't get it. 

So... Let me know. Am I thinking about this correctly? Thanks for all your help! 

P.S. I am studying to become a CFPÂ® Professional. I'm taking the exam in March, so this is an especially good exercise for me.","Loss Aversion, Regret Aversion, Sunk Cost Fallacy, Present Bias","The individual in the statement is considering a complex financial maneuver to claim the Saver's Credit, a ""free $200,"" despite it potentially resulting in a net loss of $100.

Hi, everyone. I'll try to keep this short. (EDIT: I tried, but failed. I thought giving enough background was important, given that I am asking how much you think I'm objectively worth being paid). 

Basically... I am a 28 year old college graduate. I graduated in 2014. I live in the DMV/Washington, DC metropolitan area. Six months after school, I got my first job in retail pharmacy. They started me at $9 per hour then bumped me to $11.50 when my local county raised the minimum wage. I never got another raise. After three years, I moved on to work in a hospital pharmacy for a year making $13.79. I worked there for a year. When I got fired from that job, I decided to go a different direction and explore the financial services industry. I had no experience. I found a small RIA (financial planning firm) and started working for there for minimum wage. I learned a lot but the company was badly mismanaged and lacked any semblance of organization.

After 14 months of working there, I was recruited by another local firm where I currently work. They started me at $16 per hour and gave me a raise to $17 after a 60 day probationary period. This was stipulated in my employment offer. I started making $17 an hour back in August and have not had a review since that time. No health insurance, no 401k or other profit sharing plan. Just two weeks a year of vacation. I will have two years in the financial services industry this coming March. In that time, I have passed my series 65, which is required for one to become an Investment Advisor Representative and to actually charge money for investment advice. I have also been studying for my CFPÂ® Certification Examination, which I will be taking this March 16th. The certification is well-known and respected in the industry.

lep77l,Just-A-Random-Guy-92,"Help With My Budget?

Hey, guys. I was on Facebook this morning and came across a post from a friend asking everyone who had their own home or apartment to sound off. Well, I sounded off by asking how everyone could afford that. I make $17 an hour and I can't even afford a 1BR/1BA apartment in my area. And some guy had the audacity to tell me I needed to manage my money better, because people make a lot less than that and can do it. At first, I was honestly offended. But then I realized that he could, possibly, be right. I've always thought my budget is pretty bare bones. I'm not crazy frugal, but I also don't go out and buy everything my little heart desires. Quite to the contrary. Anyway, I thought I would come here to see if my budget really needs some tinkering or if this other guy is full of shit. So without further ado:

&amp;#x200B;

Monthly Net Pay (Approximate) - $2,175

YouTube Music - $9.99

Storage Space - $73.00

Mobile Phone (Device &amp; Plan) - $109.54

Gym Membership - $19.99

Gas - $30.00

Miscellaneous - $25.00

Car Insurance - $177.00

Health Insurance - $282.73

Food - $300.00

Auto Loan - $312.69

Dental Insurance - $34.96

Student Loans (PAYE) - $68.00 (Total Debt Burden is Approximately $34,000)

&amp;#x200B;

That leaves me with about $730 per month. And apartments around here cost 70-80% more than that, minimum (reference: [https://www.apartments.com/germantown-md/](https://www.apartments.com/germantown-md/)). That's without even taking utilities into account. To address a few items above, I know my food budget is a little high. But it's not spent eating out. I try to eat pretty healthfully and that costs a little bit extra. My auto loan and insurance are also pretty high. For the loan... It kinda is what it is. I need my car. And for the insurance, I've been in some BS accidents in the past where I've hit debris in the road that was pretty much unavoidable. And of course I'm at fault for that, so my premiums are high. But I recently got a quote for per-mile insurance that will provide me with substantial savings. Finally, health insurance is expensive. But it's not something I'm willing to compromise on. I don't qualify for subsidies.

The Sunk Cost Fallacy is visible in their justification for keeping their current auto loan and insurance, citing past accidents and the necessity of having a car, rather than considering more cost-effective options. Lastly, the Affect Heuristic is at play, as the individual's emotional response to the Facebook post and the commenter's advice leads them to question their budget, but also to defend their current spending habits.","The individual exhibits a tendency to prioritize maintaining their current financial situation and lifestyle, while being influenced by emotional responses and past investments, which leads to a reluctance to make significant changes to their budget."

Hi, all. First... I just wanted to say that I *did* try to post this in r/jobs, but apparently that subreddit is now private. That being said... 

I am in talks with a company out in Carmel, Indiana, which is a suburb of Indianapolis. The person who reached out to me first mentioned that starting pay out there would be $51,000. I take this with a grain of salt, but this figure seems reasonable given the industry, my credentials, and my level of experience.

I am currently in the DMV/Washington, DC metropolitan area. I'm actually in a Maryland suburb (think Rockville, Gaithersburg, Bethesda, Potomac if you're at all familiar with the area) and I am making $35,360 per year. You can probably see why I want to change jobs.

How far will it go, irrespective of of what I should or should not be making in my potential new position? I did a little bit of research and it seems like the cost of living out there is about 35% less than it is where I am currently, so I'm effectively getting an even bigger raise in real terms than I am in absolute terms.

I am getting ready to move out of state for a new job I start in May and I'll be making significantly more than I am now.

\- Gross Pay: $4,250

\- Taxes: $877.08

\- Pretax Medical/Dental/Vision Premiums: $337

\- Net Pay: $3,035.92

r177h9,JustMeerkats,"Second Opinions on Upcoming Decisions

Hi yall! I'm on mobile, so I apologize for any typos and/or formatting issues. I'm internally struggling with some decisions regarding how best to use some funds, mainly around Roth IRAs. 

Some points before I start:

- My husband and I are both in our late 20s
- We both work full time, netting around ~67k/yr
- No kids (yet....currently TTC after an early mc)
- We own our own home in a very low COL area 
- We have two vehicles that are financed 
- No credit card debt 
- No student loans (praise the feeeze on interest that allowed us to pay everything off)
- We have approximately 6 months worth of expenses in savings, plus enough to cover our medical deductibles if need be. 

My husband has to have some extensive dental work done soon. He has an appointment with an oral surgeon in the start of 2022. We don't know exactly how expensive it will be, but I can imagine it will be upwards of 5k+. We would like to pay out of pocket for this. He is on my company's dental plan and just added his company's dental plan to have the extra coverage.   

He has also applied to go back to school for his masters.  It would be entirely online, and he would continue to work full time throughout the duration of the program. He doesn't want to rake out loans for that, and if he only takes one course a semester, I believe we could swing it. Before anyone asks: no, his employer will not pay for this (or any degree).  It's an entirely different field than what he currently does. 

I've been delving into retirement and investing.  I have a small investing account that gets $100 added every month.  I have been looking into the magic that are Roth IRAs. I would like to have us both start one and preferably max it out. 

However, I'm not sure that maxing out a Roth would be the way to go woth the upcoming expenses that we know we will have. Between school, dental work, and a potential baby, I'm just not sure it'd be the smartest decision.  I suppose I'm just looking for second opinions of what others would do in a similar situation.  

I will gladly answer any follow-up questions if you have any.

Additionally, their hesitation to max out a Roth IRA due to anticipated expenses indicates loss aversion, as they fear potential losses or financial strain. The individual's consideration of maintaining their current financial situation and not taking on additional debt also implies a status quo bias.

ue4c85,JustMeerkats,"Explain Taxes to Me like I'm a Toddler...

Hi everyone.  I am confused about tax brackets and standard deductions.  

My husband and I contribute to Roth IRAs every year.  I understand the kicker with Roth funds are that they are post-tax dollars- that is, you have already paid taxes on them in the highest tax bracket.  Most people will benefit more from a traditional 401(k)/traditional IRA because they will be making more money in retirement than while they were working- therefore, deferring the taxes until retirement is beneficial.

So, getting into the meat and potatoes...

The obvious thing that you would want to do is to have enough of your taxable income lowered until you are pushed into a lower bracket.  For example, for married, filing jointly, your taxable income  must be between 20,550 and 83,500 to be in the 12% tax bracket.  **Does this include the standard deduction of $25,900?** In other words, if a couple grossed $109,000 for the year, would they be taxed at 22% or 12% (which is what bracket they would be in if they took the standard deduction)?  Or is each person taxed separately?

v4qyti,JustMeerkats,"Retirement Options for Married Couples

Per my last post...

My husband (28) and I (27) both have government jobs.  Both jobs have a pension, as well as a 457b. Husband has a 401(k). My workplace offers no employer match whatsoever.  My 456b options all have high expense rations, with the lowest being 0.94%.  Husband's are closer to \~0.05%.

I made \~37k.  Husband makes 72k.

He has a Roth IRA as well, but we could either lower his contributions or stop paying into his Roth altogether.

I'm aware that retirement is fungible when married.  We would essentially be bringing my entire paychecks home and just taking more out of his...so technically the same amount of money would be going into our account, right?

Im obviously getting rid of the truck since I really dont need that much truck. However, I do need a truck. Living in the country in the midwest, roads arent the best and we can get bad winters. On top of that, I have a 23 foot travel trailer that I pull quite a bit. Bottom line, I need a truck.

Currently 26 male. Make around $42,000 a year at my current company. Could make more in the future but for right now letâ€™s just use that income. Been here for around 5 months and have $1,200 in my 401k in which they match 100% up to 6%. I have been just contributing 6% just to get that 100%.

ucc0jf,KansasDude25,"Is an apartment the way to go for the time being?

Was just at an apartment with my GF. Rent was $875 1 bed 1 bath. The lease was up and I decided to move back home with the parents and she moved back with her parents. The original plan was for me to pay off some CC and save some and then look for a house. Since I was paying for everything (my choice), I couldnâ€™t chisel away at my CC and definitely couldnâ€™t save any money afterwards. 

Thatâ€™s the original plan. But itâ€™s only been 2 days and I am already looking to get out of parents again. I just need my own space. I didnâ€™t think it would be a big deal but damn my mom is making it tough. Love her to death but shit. 

My goal is to buy a house but it doesnâ€™t sound appealing just with the how little inventory there is and the price of what is out there for starter homes. 

Whatever route I decide to go, my GF said she would contribute half of the bills. She will be making around $75k a year and Iâ€™ll be at $47k a year. So, either one wonâ€™t be an issue.

un1u6l,KansasDude25,"I feel trapped almost with the current state of the economy paired with my financial situation

I guess this is more of a rant than anything but I would welcome any advice. 

Will be turning 27 this August. I make $42k a year gross in a okay cost of living area in the Midwest (Kansas). There are places that are expensive but not terrible. 

Long story short.. I daily drive my 2013 F-150 40 miles a week round trip to work. I owe currently $18k on it and pay $380 a month for it. I was living in an apartment paying almost $1000 for everything associated with that. Last month my lease ended so I decided to move back home for a bit to save some money and get a game plan together. 

I also have about $6k in CC debt. Other than my truck and the CCâ€™s, thatâ€™s all my debt. 

Recently, since I got this newer better paying job, Iâ€™ve been thinking about getting a motorcycle. I have no problem with financing it but I kinda feel guilty almost wanting to get one now that Iâ€™m living back at home. But with gas being at $4.00 a gallon today, I donâ€™t think me getting 12mpg and filling up for $120 bucks, give or take, every week or so is sustainable. Thatâ€™s partly why I think a motorcycle may be good, not only for my wallet, but also my mental health. 

I donâ€™t currently have anything for ME. I just go to work, come home, eat, and go to bed. 5 days a week. I want SOMETHING, that brings me happiness. 

Again, Iâ€™m just not sure what route to take. I love my truck, and use it to fish and hunt and pull our camper in the warmer months, but damn is it costing me more than I want lol 

So, should I, continue on my current plan which is to just pay of my CCâ€™s as quickly as possibly and then just save some money until I find another apartment? 

Or

Finance a motorcycle, to save on my monthly fuel expense to put more money towards CCâ€™s so I can get those paid off quicker? While having something that brings me a lot of joy.

y6v5jv,KansasDude25,"Repair My Truck or Trade In?

So long story short, after some iffy decisions on my part, I bought my 2013 f150 1.5 years ago. I financed it since I was getting out of my very expensive truck and into something more realistic. 

Anyway, I owe $17k on it with 176k miles. Iâ€™m probably upside down about $2k-$4k depending on the day. Which I was okay with because I planned on driving it until it blew up. 

Well, I donâ€™t know for sure how much itâ€™s going to cost, but some repair codes and what the truck is doing in general has me thinking itâ€™s going to need some decent transmission work. Which is never cheap. Iâ€™m estimating between $1,500-$6,000. Again, I wonâ€™t know for sure until Wednesday. 

But that brings me to my question, if it is worst case scenario, so I trade it off and cut my losses, or just add to my upside down situation and pay to get it fixed? 

I understand that if I do get this fixed, it will probably be set of many many years. But that would pretty much put me at owing $23k on the truck that has almost 180k miles and is almost 10 years old.

So long story short, I have owned my 2013 F-150 for 1.5 years now. I really like the truck and planed on keeping it until the wheels fell off. Itâ€™s got 176k miles on it. However, I bought it when used car prices, especially trucks were stupid high. So I overpaid but itâ€™s in great shape. 

I still owe $16,800 on it. So I am upside down which didnâ€™t bother me very much because I planned on keeping it a long time. 

However, shit started happening with it and long story short, it needs a new transmission to the tune of $6k. 

So Iâ€™m not sure if itâ€™s a good idea to put $6k into a truck with almost 180k miles on it. I also have no way of affording that since Iâ€™m trying to pay off an additional $7k in CC debt. 

So Iâ€™m not sure if I either 

A. Trade it in on a newer truck and roll my old loan difference into the new loan, (which isnâ€™t ideal), and get a newer truck with a warranty and less miles

B. Get the transmission fixed and keep the truck forever since everything else on it is solid.

Other misc expenses are some media services like Apple Music, Disney + and Hulu that round up to about $25 a month. Besides that the only other â€œexpenseâ€ are tithes and offerings, which is 10% tithe and 10% offerings.

Our savings is standing at about $4,500 right now.

We arenâ€™t able to afford a place to live as rent is about $700 at least in this place, and we only get to keep about $400-$500 in savings a month.

Now the main issue is that my parents are planning on leaving the church and going to leave to another city 12 hours away from here. They plan on going to make a down payment for a house this weekend in which we can all live in. This has been discussed for a while now, and we agreed on them finding a four bedroom home for all of us to live. 

I just finished talking to them and while we might not move there for another year, once the house is done in about 6 months, we must start making payments and they asked for me to start helping then too; I agreed as I donâ€™t see any way we can afford a place of our own for a few more years.

My wife hates the idea as she doesnâ€™t like my parents, and would have to leave all her family behind. I donâ€™t like it because I finally got the position I wanted after a few years and I would hate to leave after only a year of holding the position.

Like I mentioned before, I donâ€™t see any other solution, and once we move we would all have to find new jobs too, and while they may pay more an hour, K might just end up making either the same or less of what I am now.

findx3,kevalopez,"Should I get dental insurance?

So this month my employer decided to offer some of health, dental, vision and life insurance. I ultimately decided on not choosing health as itâ€™s too expensive and would only cover me; I also decided not to get vision because I already had a checkup this year, and when it comes to lice Insurance, I already have a plan with StateFarm.

Now the last type of insurance Iâ€™m thinking about is dental, it would cost me $31.55 a month, and again would only cover myself, and while my employers couldnâ€™t give me much info about it they told me they think itâ€™s Delta Dental, and that it covers a set of x-rays and one or two cleaning a year.

I,m 21 years old, havenâ€™t been to the dentists in 2 years I believe, but I plan on going very soon, and seeing as my last day to decided is today I wanted to ask here if it was worth getting this plan, or go without insurance?

fng64a,kevalopez,"How to prepare for son losing medicaid

So like I mentioned in other past different posts of my own, Iâ€™m 21 years old, married and with one 11 month old child. My wife and I both work and we made $25,500 and will make about the same if not a little more above that this year.

Now,my job is a full time job as a Department Manager at a McDonaldâ€™s in our small town that pays me $9.75 an hour and gives overtime every week.

My wife only works a small gig at a local church for $9.85 an hour and makes about $100-$150 a month.

Currently we have no insurance of any type whatsoever (except car insurance and life insurance for myself) besides medicaid for our child. We currently qualify for it but after he turns one, the income limit drops to about $2,750, and we make right below that.

The main problem is that I want her to get a job so we can eventually move out from my parents, pay our car off and in the future be able to afford our own health insurance.

Now my employer does offer insurance but only the bare minimum, and it would cost around $600 or more to insure my hole family.

We have had to take our child to the ER before for dehydration issues and have had him transferred to a bigger hospital in Fort Worth three times in mess than a year; I know this could probably bankrupt us if we didnâ€™t have medicaid.

fwqlmr,kevalopez,"Employer might stop giving overtime

I'm a 22 year old that works at a franchised McDonald's as a Kitchen Department Manager making $9.75/hr, and have worked there for about 8 months so far, and was given one raise of $.75 back in December.

About a month ago when all this covid-19 scare began, almost everybody at work has had reduced hours, and when it comes to all the managers, we have had 0 scheduled overtime hours, when we usually used to get anywhere between 5 - 10 every week. My pay has never been good, but overtime always made up for it as I would always get roughly 20 - 30 overtime hours per month.

That aside, we haven't been able to meet our labor percentage goal, which is something like 21%, but now we are able to that we have less people scheduled, but I'm afraid that even when all this comes to normal, my employer will either reduce or give no more overtime to any of us. Most of the other managers don't seem to mind, they just go to work and expect to get good pay, but I'm always looking at the numbers and as of this month I am losing about $300 per month, which makes a lot of difference to me as that was almost all the savings I was getting form my job.

Ultimately my question is, when this is all over and we go back to normal, if my employer decides to give little to no overtime, should I ask for a raise, and if so how should I come to him about that?

A little background: Iâ€™m 22 years old, married with a one year old child and living with my parents as we canâ€™t afford a place of our own with my income.

Iâ€™m graduating next week from college with an Associate of Applied Sciences in Business Management.

I work as a department manager at a McDonaldâ€™s making $9.75 and hour. My wife doesnâ€™t currently have a job ( she worked at a church making a bit of money but church is closed right now because of Covid-19) as itâ€™s hard finding one with mine since it requires me working overtime and going in on some of my days off. That aside we have tried looking for a job for her, but all we find is part time low paying jobs that are not worth the time because they have schedules that go all over the place, and because the little money sheâ€™d make would put us right above the limit to qualify for our childâ€™s medicaid.

We made $25,500 last hear and I expect to make around the same, if not a little more, this year. Savings are at $4,700 plus $2,500 owed by parents, that they have available and will pay back once home deal is signed off and done. Background done

So, we plan on moving with my parents to their new home in a border city (Brownsville, Tx) later this year; the plan is for the house to be finished by July and them signing off by the end of that month so that itâ€™s ready to move in by August.

Now, if you have read my other posts, I have mentioned this before, but I basically have two choices, I either leave  on September and look for a new job for myself and hopefully also my wife, or I wait until January to do so.

The only thing that keeps me from making my mind are two things;
1. - If we move earlier we can both try to find a job that offers health insurance by or before open enrollment. (We currently have no insurance).
2.- I have read that while living in Brownsville is cheap, the jobs there pay very little (mostly minimum wage) and Iâ€™m scared that Iâ€™ll end up with a similar or worse job as I have right now being paid less with less benefits or bonuses.

So technically, I can leave early and look for a new job hoping itâ€™s better and offers benefits, or stay until January, save the money I will make at my current job and get more monthly bonuses on those last four months ( and christmas bonus) and leave on January, but lose any chance of finding a good employer that offers affordable insurance.

Quick background; I'm 22 years old married with a one year old child all of us living with my parents. I have a job at McDonald's that pays 9.75/hr and I will roughly make 25k this year out of it (if I worked all year). My wife is a stay at home mother, and while she has been looking for jobs for a while, she hasn't been successful to find anything beyond part-time jobs, and this isn't something we can have as if we go above the limit for our child's medicaid he would lose it, and a part-time job wouldn't be worth it losing it over.

The only debt we have is our car which is roughly $9,000 and we pay extra every month, we hope to pay it off in less than a year with the tax returns we might get next year. Our savings is roughly $5,500, plus an extra $3,500 we are owed and should get back on August/September.

Currently we live in a very small town in Texas with few opportunities, and my parents have already made plans to move in August to a border city in the same state. They asked us back in March if we would move with them, and our answer was ""most likely, but we will try anything in our power not to have to do that"". 

Yesterday my wife tells me that living with my parents stresses her out (which I understand because they do the same to me), and she'd like for us to move somewhere else after my parents leave this town and start a new life as a family. This really scares me as we both have no careers, we have little savings and no jobs lined up anywhere that are guaranteed to be permanent.

The reason I chose going to my parents was because we would have the safety net of living with them, and we could both get jobs that may sometimes overlap in schedules with little problem as long as my family helped with our child, and also we would save most of our money to eventually get our own house in the next five years.

While she agrees with this plan, she wants us to live on our own now, and while I would agree that it could be doable, it's risky. Also the fact that my parents already started the deal on a 4 room home, which should be done in the next three months, it would make me feel bad to tell them no and leave them with all the extra burden.

A lot of other things stress me out, like the fact that we have no health insurance, and; unless we're lucky; mos employers won't cover family plans and thus it would cost at least $600-$800 to cover our entire family; and this is something we would need because once we both have jobs our child will stop qualifying for medicaid.

nimu6z,kevalopez,"Advide regarding my finances

Hi everyone, Iâ€™ve posted here a while back and just wanted to ask for advice regarding my financial situation, especially healthcare.

Iâ€™m a 23 yo male married (22) with one child (2) and currently living with my parents as we canâ€™t afford rent. Wife is in college for nursing, still taking basics so sheâ€™s got at least two years left if not more.

I just got a new WFH job that gave me a huge pay bump. I make 16/hr + 10% bilingual differential + commission. Roughly $36k/yr base plus commission, which might be around $750 or more per month. 

Currently my wife and I are uninsured because we just canâ€™t simply afford 8k per year. Thankfully our child is on medicaid but I believe heâ€™s about to be put on CHIP because of the new job, so best case scenario heâ€™s good for the rest of the year on a not so expensive plan.

My wife and I do have dental and vision insurance though, as my employer covered the cost of those yearly.

Expenses are: (monthly)
Groceries -$400
Media - $25
Phone - $80
Car &amp; Life Insurance (me) - $135
Internet - $25
Utilities - $250
Pull ups - $70
401K - $140
Gas - $100 but varies
Tithing - 10%
Money for fun - $100

Debt -

None. We paid our car off two months ago!

What Iâ€™m worried about is that by next year I might be making at least 45K or more which might cause two problems, one is that my child might not qualify for CHIP anymore and that means Iâ€™ll have to get healthcare from employer as we wouldnâ€™t qualify for subsidies (Texas) and that would be $9K per year. 

Second is that my wife might not qualify for a lot of financial aid and we might have to pay for that too, though Iâ€™m unsure how it works and it might not be a big deal like healthcare.

My accounts are held with Fidelity. Can I just move a $6K from the inherited IRA to the Roth (paying the taxes of course) or do I cash out $6K and than contribute to the Roth in a separate transaction?",None,"The statement provided does not exhibit any obvious biases. The individual is seeking clarification on a specific financial decision regarding the transfer of funds from an Inherited IRA to a Roth IRA. They are aware of the 10-year depletion requirement and are considering a strategy to manage the taxes associated with the Inherited IRA. The questions posed are factual and focused on understanding the mechanics of the transfer, rather than being driven by emotions, assumptions, or external influences.

The individual is simply presenting a factual situation regarding an inherited IRA and a transfer issue with a financial institution. They are seeking insight and information to resolve the problem.

s5qxge,kfrech,"I-Bonds instead of bonds in my portfolio

I realize I can only purchase $10,000 worth per year. I am close to retirement and my portfolio is at about a 75/25 split. I will have a pension that will cover about 75% of our expenses, so I feel I can be a bit more aggressive.

Any thoughts on I-Bonds?","Loss Aversion, Status Quo Bias, Present Bias","The statement suggests that the individual is considering I-Bonds as a potentially more aggressive investment option, given their close proximity to retirement and the anticipated pension coverage. The preference for I-Bonds over traditional bonds may indicate Loss Aversion, as I-Bonds offer a relatively safer investment with inflation-indexed returns, which could help mitigate potential losses. Additionally, the 75/25 portfolio split and reliance on a pension might contribute to Status Quo Bias, as the individual seems inclined to maintain their current investment strategy without significantly deviating from it. Lastly, Present Bias might be present, as the individual mentions being ""close to retirement,"" which could lead to a focus on short-term security and stability, influencing their investment choices.","The individual exhibits a cautious and conservative investment approach, likely driven by a desire to avoid losses and maintain their current financial situation, with a bias towards preserving their existing portfolio composition and prioritizing short-term security."
s6k35x,kfrech,"Mortgage with limited pension but plenty of assets

3 years from retirement. Husband is already retired. I am a teacher and will retire with a pension that will cover 75% of our expenses. Health insurance is covered until age 65.

We have no debt, house that is paid off, plenty of retirement savings and a good sized brokerage account.

We will most likely downsize in the next few years. Ideally, we'd use the proceeds from the sale of our current house to fund the new house, plus cash savings. 

I've been reading that it is difficult to secure a mortgage once you don't have any real income. We will be delaying collecting SS also. We'd only want the mortgage for a short period of time; once our current house sold, we would pay off the mortgage.

My thought was to perhaps get a HELOC for the short period of time.

Any other suggestions?","Status Quo Bias, Recency Bias, Sunk Cost Fallacy, Present Bias","The statement reflects several biases. The individual's consideration of getting a mortgage or HELOC despite having a secure pension and sufficient assets suggests a Status Quo Bias, as they seem inclined to maintain their current financial situation rather than exploring alternative options that might be more beneficial. The recent reading about the difficulty of securing a mortgage once without ""real income"" may have led to a Recency Bias, where this recent information is overemphasized in their decision-making. The idea of delaying Social Security collection and using a mortgage or HELOC to fund their new house may indicate a Present Bias, prioritizing current financial flexibility over future benefits. Additionally, the reluctance to consider alternative options and instead sticking with familiar financial instruments (e.g., mortgage or HELOC) may imply a Sunk Cost Fallacy, where the individual is inclined to throw good money after a perceived 'sunk' cost or familiar financial path.","The individual exhibits a tendency to prioritize familiar financial paths and recent information, while underemphasizing future benefits and alternative options, reflecting a combination of biases that lead to a conservative and potentially costly financial decision."

I've figured out the tax implications and am prepared to begin doing some conversions. Besides doing it before the end of year, is there any sort of strategy involved?

I am new to the conversion process, so my questions might be a bit ignorant. If I am converting, I'm technically selling, correct (thus the tax hit)? If that's the case, do I wait for the market to rebound?

I guess I'm asking a timing question.","Loss Aversion, Present Bias, Anchoring","The individual's inquiry about a preferred strategy for Roth conversions and their concern about timing the market reveal several biases. Their consideration of waiting for the market to rebound before converting suggests Loss Aversion, as they are hesitant to ""sell"" (convert) during a downturn, fearing losses. Additionally, their focus on the short-term tax implications and market fluctuations indicates Present Bias, as they prioritize immediate concerns over long-term benefits. Furthermore, their question about waiting for the market to rebound implies Anchoring, as they seem to be anchored to the current market situation and are uncertain about when to act.","The individual exhibits a tendency to prioritize short-term concerns and fear losses, leading to hesitant and potentially suboptimal decision-making when it comes to Roth conversions."

My husband and I have all of our assets held with Fidelity (Traditional IRA, Roth, Beneficiary IRA and a brokerage account).

Additionally, Mental Accounting is present as the individual is creating separate ""buckets"" for different goals, in this case, a brokerage account specifically for their future grandchildren, and considering it as a distinct entity rather than a part of their overall financial portfolio.

A few years from retirement. We will have a pension that will cover 75% of our monthly expenses. We will supplement with cash savings under we take SS at FRA.
