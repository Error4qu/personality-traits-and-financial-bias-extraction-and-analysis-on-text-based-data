My employer uses optum for hsa and employer contributes 21$ biweekly as I contribute 172 per paycheck. I did read a lot of optum posts on their fees.

I am currently single, no kids and am thinking of getting a new condo (construction just begun, eta early 2022) [https://www.boulevardvi.com/](https://www.boulevardvi.com/).  I live in fairfax,va and the area has been increasing in housing sales ([https://www.redfin.com/city/6790/VA/Fairfax/housing-market](https://www.redfin.com/city/6790/VA/Fairfax/housing-market)). 

The current sale has 2bed/2bath \~400k, + den \~500, 3bed/3bath \~600. I want 2/2 at a minimum but my parents think 3/3 might be ideal if i have kids later.

m1784y,shaselai,"Question about mortgages and buying a new house

So I am planning to buy a new construction and i have been in talks with a couple of lenders doing my due diligence. The developer has its own lender and they said they will give 6k credit towards closing costs. 

Now, I don't know what rate I will get from the lenders, the ""ideal"" situation would be the developer's lender gives me the lowest rate AND i get credit so I don't need to think twice. But, one of my lenders did say I could refinance to get a potentially lower market rate after I sign with the developer's lender (and reap the lender credit benefit) since the lenders for developers don't necessarily give best rates. I did to a little research on points and lender credit and how lender credit is reverse points and that could mean i get a higher rate at cost of getting $$$.

I have a couple of questions:

1. Is it OK to ask the developer about refinancing? I don't know if they care if i sign with them and then couple months later refinance. I am also concerned about potential penalties or return of closing costs. If asking them will alert them then i rather not.
2. Is this strategy legit? It does sound fine - get the lender credits then refinance at lower rate. Naturally it has to make financial sense on the refinance as well.
3. Does it make sense to ""shop around"" lenders? I only kept in touch with 2 lenders for pre-approvals. One lender gave me a higher pre-approval rate than the other. Should I reach out to that just as due diligence?

negz76,shaselai,"Question about 401k benefits vs Salary

 

I am looking for new job but I feel this question on determining offers is more of a personal finance question:

I noticed some companies provides pretty high 401k contributions (not 401k matching) vs bigger companies. For example, one company has 4% matching, 4% contribution and 2-6% year end 401k contribution. I am curious how much weight one should put that into consideration for whole package vs pure salary? Assume that vesting period doesn't play a role. 

Ex:

Company 1 pays you 100,000 with 2% 401k contribution = 102,000

Company 2 pays you 95,000 with 10% 401k contribution = 104,500

On paper the value of Company 2's offer trumps 1. However, the  difference in salary means i have less to spend now vs more saved on the backend. Also, I suppose I am not getting taxed on the difference in this example which is nice.

I guess from savings standpoint, the extra contribution can count towards how much I would've saved anyhow if I took home more of the paycheck? But also 401k contribution is not guaranteed right? just because 12% this year doesn't mean it stays that way next year? But salary is...

yd9tyo,shaselai,"Need help evaluating couple of offers

I have following offers - both IT, 40 hr weeks, similar distance, similar work and stability.

1. 195k base, 15% 401k (not matching just ""bonus"" to put into my 401k account even if i put in 0), 25 PTO. Can work Over Time (1.5) if I desire. Take home pay \~ 120k + \~30k from employer 401k
2. 220k base, 5% 401k, 20 PTO (can prob ask 5 more). Salary is at ""Do not exceed"" mark. Take home  136k + 11k from employer 401k

So both total value seems the same but money now vs saved is the big difference here - i calculated the take home pay assuming i put in 20k 401k myself as well.

One thing that ""concerns"" me is the ""do not exceed"" pay on offer 2. I have worked with companies that if you are at ""max payband"" you either don't get raises OR you need to be promoted to next level's pay band in which case you might be too expensive for the project and need to look for another project. Of course there may be additional other expectations for being promoted to next level as well. 

It does seem like option 1 has more ""future financial flexibility"" with not maxing out on pay and the project can even afford over time pay...

Background: Iâ€™m 20 years old and my only credit history is as an authorized user on my dads card. This has given me a score of 771 on credit karma and it says 12 years of history. 


Reasoning for post: I recently read the free 10xtravel course and like the idea of travel hacking and utilizing SUBâ€™s while maintaining an excellent credit score. I want to start building up points/miles now, so when I am around 23-25 I can use them to travel cheaply and efficiently. In the course, it suggests to have a 750 score and at least 1 year of credit history (not as an authorized user.) This brings me to my questions.


Questions: Since I need 1 year of credit and Iâ€™m 20 years old, I should probably start building my own credit anyway. Knowing that this will be my first ever credit card and you should never close your longest line of credit, should my first card be a catch all, no FTF card? Or what are yalls thoughts on what my first card should be?


I also have questions about utilization on credit cards. I sometimes spend $0/month and recently wanted a google photos subscription at $9.99/month to store/backup my photos and videos. Is $9.99/month on a credit card good enough or is that bad utilization and will hurt me?

Lastly, does anyone here practice the 10xtravel philosophy? Do points/miles ever expire if you never close the account? Is there anything I should know before getting into the hobby that wasnâ€™t said in the course? Also, can anyone explain the downgrading/canceling your card and how to do so whilst keeping an excellent credit score?

Robinhood Gold Membership = Free Money?

Itâ€™s been a while since anyone has posted about this subject and wanted to see what people think about it now. I am considering lump summing in January, but am not sure if this is a good idea.

Overview:  $5/month for Membership

3% IRA match (Must hold gold membership for a year) + (Hold IRA for minimum 5 years)

$1000 0% Margin Funds (Theoretically put this into 4.9% APY then pay back $1000?)

1% Transfers for IRAâ€™s and 401kâ€™s

4.9% APY (I know T-Bills are better, I currently use them)

So the math= 

$5 x 12 = $60/yr

$1000 in 4.9% APY = $49 when you must pay back $1000. This essentially means your membership is $11 until rates lower back down

If IRA contribution limit is $7000 next year, this means they will match you $210 of TAX ADVANTAGED money. Having this compound over the years will be huge. (if your time horizon allows.

In conclusion, is this a good idea? or should I stick to fidelity? I wonâ€™t roll over my current IRA.

qqzh6k,SillyRecover,"25 Years Old And Don't Know What To Do About Living Situation. Looking For Advice.

I recently turned 25 and still live at home with my mother and grandmother. I have 50k saved and I make 50k a year. We split the rent 3 ways so I only have to spend $300 on rent each month. This has allowed me to accelerate my savings to what I have now.  The main reason I have stayed home this long is to save up enough money to buy a house ( preferably a duplex ).

I want to purchase a duplex and rent out one side with the tenant mostly paying the mortgage. While I stay on the other side with a roommate. By doing this I would live rent-free and could possibly be able to turn a profit ( At worst I live rent-free). I went to school for Real Estate at a young age ( 18 ) and I was educated on the Ins and Outs of housing. I learned that there are advantages to owning a home over renting an apartment.

In my city, a decent 2 bedroom apartment will run you about $1000-1100 in rent per month. Rents for most apartments in my city go up about $100 per year lately. For example, If I were to buy a 220k duplex ( Which is basically two houses ) my mortgage would be about $1200 for the life of the loan. In the end, the mortgage doesn't matter since I wouldn't be paying it myself. The thing is that millions of other Americans have realized what I explained above and are catching on. The housing market in my area is now EXTREMELY competitive and it's making it hard to land something desirable.

Over the last 2 years, I've slowly gained the desire to move out more and more. I want my own place that I can decorate and set up as I wish. I recently had a friend move to a new apartment and he has a spare room and he asked me to move in and I've been debating on it. One issue is that if I move I would take on an extra $500+ of monthly expenses. We would split his $1050 rent and utilities both ways. The other issue is that he's moving to a location/apartment that I don't necessarily have a desire to live in/at.

Yes, I want to move out but that doesn't necessarily mean I want to be in any situation. I want to purchase a house and go with my original plan as I explained above. I've been debating if it's worth taking on the extra expenses for another place I don't necessarily want to be. I would be leaving one situation I don't want to be in just to join another.

And before someone asks, I'm an adult. I pay my own bills, wash my own clothes, buy my own groceries, wash my own dishes, etc. I just simply live in my mother's house. I'm single and introverted, I mostly keep to myself. I don't see much change if I were to move with my personal life. I don't think it's really hindered my personal/sex life. A lot of people in my age group still live at home and the women I've run into don't really care. Most of them live at home still themselves for the reasons I explained above.

I never thought it was worth it if I knew I wasn't going to be with the company long anyway.  What happens to the money if I have to change companies ?. What if my new employer uses a different bank for their investment accounts ( fidelity vs wells Fargo ), does the money transfer over?

What if I leave the job in a year, will I lose the money that my company contributed over that time ?. I also don't know if I'm open to losing more of my paycheck. I already have to pay taxes, healthcare, bills, etc. I don't know how it works if I were to need the money in the account at a random time.  

Maybe I need to speak to HR or some sort of financial expert. I've been thinking of putting the money from my savings account somewhere to gain interest but I just don't know where. I don't want to put it in stocks because I could end up losing money. Banks don't really pay anything regarding interest for savings accounts. If I could put it somewhere and gain 1% interest a year without losing money that would be great.

I understand that an employer contributing 4% is great but if it takes 5 years to see it all, whats the point ? Who's to say I won't receive another job offer in 2024 for a $20,000 raise in salary ?

zj4vmz,SillyRecover,"Help me understand savings account interest rate. should I switch banks for higher interest ?

I currently bank with a local Credit Union and have $60,000 saved, when checking my account I noticed that I've been receiving $7 in "" dividends ""  monthly for a while.

So if I switch to that bank, I would earn $2,400 a year on 60k, or am I doing the math wrong ?

Hi! So I am currently filling out a W-4 for my third job and I am a bit confused. 

So I have two jobs and I got this third one that I am filling out the W-4 for (Don't worry, it's just a full-time, a part-time, and this is a paid volunteer-based gig). Anyway, I did the Multiple Jobs Worksheet.

- My main job is salaried. 40 hours/week paid bi-weekly.
- My part-time job is part-time, 9 hours/week paid bi-weekly.
- This third paid volunteer position is where you sign up for shifts. It's variable hours depending on if I want to work a shift or not. There can be a chance that I don't even work for this gig for a month. I don't expect heavy hours. I don't know if this is biweekly/monthly pay.

***(c) Extra withholding. Enter any additional tax you want withheld each pay period . .*** 

After doing the Multiple Jobs Worksheet, I've got $143 for my Extra withholding for Step 4c. It doesn't seem correct because I know I won't be earning that much from my paycheck especially since I anticipate light hours like 3-4 hrs a shift if I was free and willing to do the shift.

I'm lost in what this all means since I'm not well-versed in these things. My brain says they'll deduct $143 each paycheck no matter what (I don't know if my pay is biweekly/weekly since I haven't volunteered yet. It just feels like I won't get paid at all due to this withholding.)

I wanted to play it safe and ask before I submit this form.

For the past couple of months, I've been learning about personal finances and have done a decent job at budgeting. Now, I feel like is a good time to take the next step and get a credit card since I've been using my debit this entire time.

I'm 27 in California. Chase is my current main bank. Regrettably never had a credit card. I've been with my bank since February escaping a previous bad situation with a different bank (long story short, had a joint account with my father and he stole money, so I'm in the process of closing that account.)

I want this card so that I can start building credit. I've also heard it's safer to use your credit card online versus a debit card as you're covered more. Though, I got some questions I wanted to ask.

1. **Am I able to get a credit card online/phone instead of in-person?** I'm not in a safe position to leave the house as much due to my family and I being in a high risk category for COVID.

2. ""Total Annual Gross Income"" is a question I see on Chase's ""get a decision in seconds"" application. I've been furloughed and then eventually forced to resign (due to me rejecting hours in fear of COVID.). I worked at this job from November up to last week. I've been currently collecting Unemployment since March/April. **How do I calculate what my gross income is? Do I calculate my time from Nov-March? Do I calculate my Unemployment? Do I even have a ""Total Annual Gross Income"" since I was forced to resign and I'm no longer working?**

3. **Are my chances of getting a credit card through Chase pretty good since that's my current bank?** I've looked into this and IIRC that if I didn't sign up during my time in college where it was easier, that I'd most likely have to look into a secured credit card. **Would my short, but current time in Chase along with money I've been saving up help me out?**

Sorry if these questions sound silly. I'm still new to things in adulthood... even at 27.","Anchoring, Overconfidence","The user is exhibiting Anchoring bias when they consider their ""short, but current time in Chase along with money I've been saving up"" as a factor that could help them get a credit card, potentially anchoring on their existing banking relationship rather than their creditworthiness.

l6ogug,SilverSquare,"Having trouble with checking my credit score. Need help.

Hi, I'm 28 years old and never had a credit card before. Decided to do research to finally get the wheels rolling. Right now, I'm going through the wiki and looking at what first cards to get. I know that there's a chance I may not qualify for my main bank, a starter, and even secured card. I haven't tried yet, but one thing that intrigued me was checking my credit score.

I wanted to check my credit score out of curiosity. Parts of me are curious and want to know if it's 0. Parts of me, I have slight anxiety that my family might've affected my credit because they can tend to be shady like that.

I went to the Annual Credit Report website that I saw linked and went to fill out all my information and for some reason I can't get my report because my records don't match. I entered my legal full name, I got my SSN. I even got my birth certificate and social security number. Is there a reason why I can't get a credit report? Is it because I never had a credit card before? Or is there a more pressing issue I should be worried about?

Hey guys, just a 27-year-old trying to get control of his life, so sorry if this is a noob question. But I'm ready to make the next big move. Getting a credit card.

I've never had a credit card in my life. The journey so far was just sharing a card with my Dad until something happened and I decided to get my own card in a different back.

I currently have a debit card (checking account) with Chase and I'm one year into being with them. I've been doing well with saving money and currently have $20k saved up.

I was laid off from my full-time job since the pandemic. Currently job hunting, but my only two sources of income are my streaming and my part-time contract job. My stream doesn't pay as much, maybe around $100 every two months. My part-time job lasts until July. In total, my estimate gross-income so far looks like it's going to be around $5k-$6k.

I know it's hard without credit. I'm not a student. I'm worried my estimate gross-income is low. I guess I'm just hoping they would accept my application for a Chase Freedom Card based on me being good with saving money as well as the fact that I'm already a member of their bank.

At the same time, I know that it may not matter, so I wanted to ask you guys at /r/personalfinance. Do I have a decent case for this? Or would I most likely have to find a secured/starter card?","Loss Aversion, Overconfidence, Anchoring","The user is exhibiting Loss Aversion by worrying about the potential rejection of their credit card application, which is influencing their decision to apply.

ncljcs,SilverSquare,"Opened up a Roth IRA and I have some newbie questions!


Hi everyone. 28 year old, late-bloomer, from California looking to invest in my future. Got a 6-month emergency savings fund of $9000, currently not at a full time so no 401k. So my next goal is Roth IRA. Tried to do research and look at the wiki, but I have some simple newbie questions since I have trouble understanding them.

1. **Was transferring $6000 from my bank to my Roth Contributory IRA (for the 2020 year) just as simple as that in terms of ""contributing"" to my IRA?** At least for the bare minimum? Theoretically, can I just do that and leave it be for the bare minimum or is there more action I need to take?

2. **Why do I have a Roth Contributory IRA instead of a regular Roth IRA?** I signed up on Schwab with the intention of a Roth IRA. Is it the same or are they different?

2. I already transferred the money. It's tradeable. **If I choose to trade, Do I have until the tax deadline May 17th to trade or do I have a lot of time since my money is already there?**

3. **As someone who is still new to this, what are possible options?** A friend and online research seem to recommend to put it all on Index Funds. I used Schwab. Would the S&amp;P 500 or Schwab Total Stock Market Index FundÂ® be things I should be eyeing?

4. **Do I put all $6000 on an Index Fund?** Or should I just consider putting a partial amount?

5. **Once May 17th passes. Can I withdraw the 6000 I contributed to the 2020 year any time I want?** I know I can withdraw what I contributed without penalty as long as it's not earnings. Wanted to know if there was a ""cut-off date."" I don't plan to withdraw, but it's more of a ""just in case of emergency/last resort"" type of deal.

nup6j6,SilverSquare,"Got approved for my first credit card! But I still have worries and questions I want to ask you all.

Hi guys! I've been learning a lot on /r/personalfinance. I got my first credit card. I'm 28, but I was surprised that my first application for a Chase Freedom Unlimited Card got accepted. I was expecting to get rejected and start with a secured card.

My credit limit is $1500.

Was I lucky? I'm not a college student anymore. Never had any loans, student debt thanks to financial aid. Nothing I've done for me to expect me to have a score (if any at all) that'll get me accepted.

I had a linked debit card with my Dad at another bank that I've had since college. Then things happened (he took money from my account without asking, caused overdrafts, etc.) and in 2020 I changed to Chase where I've maintained a checking account. Currently around 15k. Just became frugal with my only ""big"" transaction being a transfer to my brokerage for my Roth IRA.

I don't know if I was just lucky or if Chase saw that I maintained a high balance for over a year. Still just a little worried since I know many people got rejected by Chase for their first credit card. My parents weren't the best at money. Back then, Mom didn't understand credit cards and would spend a lot. My dad wasn't any better. I have reason to believe they might've opened a card under my grandpa's name (consensually, but still not responsible). I'm just afraid with their past history of not being good with money that they might've opened something under my name without me knowing?

**tl;dr:**

* **I'm happy to get my first credit card with Chase! Is there a way to check my credit score to make sure my parent's bad financial history didn't affect me? (ex. Didn't open a credit line under my name or something..)**

* **I know there's three companies (Equifax, etc.) that can check. From my understanding, I get one free check from each for a year. I'd rather not ""waste"" it incase I should wait for like the end of the year. What do you recommend the strategy is?**

* **Was I lucky to get a Chase Credit Card as my first card? 28. I assumed I didn't have a credit score or a ""default score"". I don't have anything like loans or debt that I can think of.

1. **Capping** my Chase Checking Account at around **$3000**. Anything above that gets deposited to the High Yield Savings Account or on an index fund.

2. **Build my credit** by using my Chase Freedom Unlimited Card by using it and paying it off. Only utilizing 30% of my credit.

2. Open a **High Yield Savings Account** at Ally. Deposit my Emergency Savings + other things like an overseas vacation trip, etc.

nw01zp,SilverSquare,"I want to deposit around $4000-$5000 dollars in cash, what do I need to know ahead of time?

Hi, I have 4000-5000 in cash. About 70% of that was cash I had stashed for a Japan trip pre-pandemic. 30% is general savings from gifts, allowance or whatever. The Japan trip stash was from withdrawing it and putting it aside my paychecks pre-pandemic (laid of due to COVID from that previous job). General savings is self-explanatory.

Why do I have it in cash? One, had an incident where I had a shared checking account with my Dad (US Bank) and he took money, so I panic withdrew and kept my money. I switched to a different bank (Chase), but this was right before the pandemic, so I didn't have the opportunity to deposit.

Two, I just didn't know better. Learned about how to handle my finances better and now know it's better to keep it at a bank, high yield savings account, investments/retirement, etc. instead of letting it collect dust.

I know traveling around with a lot of cash on me is a big risk. I'm definitely gonna err on the side of safety. But in terms of legal stuff, is there anything I need ahead of time? I never deposited through a teller. Always through ATMs.

owsc1y,SilverSquare,"Clarification about Credit Utilization

Hi guys, recently got a credit card a few months ago and am curious about credit utilization. To my understanding, you donâ€™t use your entire credit line if you want to increase your score. My credit line is $1500, so $450 is what I should aim for.

Question is, what if I spent like $200 on the first week, paid it off and spend $300 more by my third week. 

It would mean I spent $500 total. Would my credit utilization still remain under 30% since I paid off the $200? Thus meaning it goes back to 0% until I paid more?

rvr3b6,SilverSquare,"Question about Roth IRA for 2021 and 2022!

Hi, it's almost been a year since I've started on this journey of being more informed and trying to improve my personal finances. Late bloomer where I started at 28 (now 29 today)

To get right to the point, I have some simple questions about Roth IRAs. So I've started one earlier this year. I'm using Charles Schwab and in my Roth IRA, I'm using SWYNX which is a Schwab Target Index Fund for my retirement year (2060).

In **2020**, I maxed my contributions at 6K since I got furloughed and stayed at home.

In **2021**, I currently have $4K. Got a new salaried job in the summer. **At this current state, should I top it off with the remaining $2K? Or should I keep it at $4K? My gross income is $60K. In Cali, my net income would be about $10-20K lower?** I haven't maxed it yet because in the past I wasn't sure about my job situation and was worried the end of the year might be too late to reap the benefits.

In **2022**, I currently have nothing saved. Currently continuing what I did late 2021 which was to deposit $500 biweekly. I heard it's best to do one lump sum of $6K as soon as I can to take advantage of compound interest. **If Roth contributions are based off my taxed income, do I have to wait till I make $6K? If not, what if I contribute $6K now and hypothetically I get fired in two weeks? Would that screw me over?**

Stressed out and my first time really using insurance on my own and don't have family to help. Long story short, was talking to a psychiatrist about ADHD, told me to get a Blood Test (got it at LabCorp). This was a little over a month ago. They said it was covered, their website said it was covered by my insurance. My insurance is Anthem Blue Cross (Anthem Premier PPO 250/15/10)

Was looking at my claims. Saw two denied claims. Both from the blood test. One was an in-network charge. $290 for Outpatient. I'm assuming that's just going there for the first time. According to the claim, my discount would've meant it covered it all. I don't know if this means I'm off the hook or this is what I would've had if I was covered.

The other claim was for my blood test. Apparently, it was out-of-network because of the lab they sent my blood to? It was denied. It was billed at around $1800+ and according to Anthem, the discount would've paid for it all. This was also denied.

Looking at my Explanation of Benefits, I only owe $15 which is just a copay from my psych, which I'm fine with.

The member will receive a new Explanation of Benefits after the claim is resubmitted to the correct health plan.

vm9hn2,SilverSquare,"Am I doing anything wrong in my credit journey in regards to my credit score/credit limit?

Hi, still fairly new to having a credit card in my life after having a shared debit card for most of my life. I'm 29 in the US.

I have autopay on as an emergency, I even pay my credit card often (no schedule, but I check every now and then, see some balance and pay it off). I don't go beyond 30% utilization. Never went over credit. Never late on a monthly payment. I feel like I'm financially responsible. I just don't know if this is a patience thing or if there's a way I can be more efficient here.

* I only had this credit card for over two years.
* It's my only Credit Card.
* I have Chase Freedom Unlimited.

Is there a more efficient way to increase my credit score? It seems like I have dry months where either nothing changes. And when there is movement, it's either +6, +3, or -9, etc. I just had a +9 today, but that was after previously getting a -8 a few weeks ago. I base this off Chase's Credit Journey, which uses VantageScore 3.0.

Also, in regards to my credit limit. I started at $1500. Earlier this year, they bumped it to $2000. I make around $60k a year in my career versus when I first got my credit card I was doing part-time retail. Do I just need to be patient? Should I look into another credit card? I don't forsee myself making a huge purchase other than possibly a new computer around $2.5-$4k. But either way, I can save up enough to pay it, it's just the credit limit issue. Is it as easy as asking?

wqer7l,SilverSquare,"Can you guys help analyze my current financials/system and suggest ways that I can improve it?

Hi guys! Been following the subreddit for a while and definitely learned a lot. I was wondering if you guys can look at my finances and suggest ways that I can make it more efficient? I followed some of the flowchart, but I know I got to a point where I need some second opinions from some different eyes especially with some of the choices Iâ€™m making with investing more in a HYSA than stocks. I currently work from home and live at home with my parents. Planning to move out within the next year or so once I feel more comfortable with my financial independence and the current living market in CA. Iâ€™m 29M.

**INCOME**:

* Job: $3400/month Net Pay after taxes.
* Side Hustles: $700~ after taxes.

**INVESTMENTS**

* Roth IRA: $16k | Started about 2-3 years ago. Intending to put $6k at the beginning of the year ever year if possible.

* Brokerage: $1.1k on a SWTSX (Schwab Total Stock Market Index Fund)

* 401K: 3.5k | I matched the company match and started contributing to my 401k back in April. Money is going to a 2060 Retirement Fund.*

**SAVINGS (HYSA w/ Ally Bank)**: $38k

* Future Japan Trip: $5k
* Emergencies: $10k
* General Savings/Interest: $400~
* â€œIndependent Livingâ€: $22k

**Other Notes**:

- I only have one credit card. It is a little over a year old. Itâ€™s the Chase Freedom Unlimited Card. Credit is $2700. I never asked for an increase as increases I got were automatic. Credit is good around 720 and I am responsible for having auto pay on and always paying my balance. Would love to increase my credit limit and score, but not sure how to proceed.

- I am currently using YNAB to help manage my finances and trying to see how I can utilize that better.

- Not too much outgoing expenses outside of me eating out, subscriptions, or medicals (I have diabetes, depression, and ADHD so meds/checkups tend to stack up). I currently use public transportation and spend around $150 a month. I just got my driver's license, so I know that I'll be saving up for a car and paying car insurance. Health insurance is deducted from my paycheck and I pay copay.


**Spending Context**:

- $2200 gets automatically deposited each month from my bank to a HYSA. For me, I currently live at home. This is my â€œwayâ€ of simulating how much monthly expenses would be if I moved out (Rent + Other Expenses). Currently using a HYSA since itâ€™s the more safer, less volatile â€œset it and forget itâ€ option. Could possibly parlay this into my emergency fund or maybe I can use this for investing into my index fund or other stocks. Either way, looking to move out within the next 1-2 years and I know that would mean my income would be slashed in half because it'd be going towards to rent.

- I maximize my Roth IRA every year at the beginning if possible.

- I currently don't have a system in regards to my investment accounts (no automatic transfers, no system of investing x each x amount of days, etc.)

- I currently use the 50-30-20 budget style with my remaining budget of $1200. I feel like this can be too limiting especially after moving $2200 every month to a HYSA.","Status Quo Bias, Loss Aversion, Mental Accounting","The user's financial decision-making is influenced by a combination of biases. The decision to simulate monthly expenses by transferring $2200 to a HYSA while living with parents indicates a cautious approach, reflecting Status Quo Bias as they maintain their current comfortable living situation.

Additionally, the user has categorized their savings into separate buckets (e.g., ""Future Japan Trip"", ""Emergencies"", ""Independent Living""), which is a clear example of Mental Accounting, where the user is treating different sums of money differently based on their designated purposes.","The user exhibits a risk-averse and cautious financial decision-making behavior, driven by a combination of biases that lead to a preference for safe and familiar financial choices."
xklzze,SilverSquare,"Would it be worth getting a Schwab Bank High Yield Investor Checking Account?

***TLDR: Would the Schwab Bank High Yield Investor Checking Account be worth opening up to have in my back pocket for the benefits of the foreign transaction/ATM fees whenever I travel internationally again? Or would it be redundant if I am seeking to get a credit card down the line that has no foreign transaction fee?***

Hi! I just got back from my first international trip and the travel bug bit me. At the same time, I'm developing the next step in improving my financial situation in regards to getting cards/credit cards that will help me have more flexibility and benefits. Been researching and asking peeps between here and the Credit Card subreddit. **TLDR at the top and everything below this is just for context/mind dumping that you don't have to read. But feel free to throw any advice if you want.**

---

To give a quick high-level overview of my personal finance situation, I've tried to follow the flowchart as much as I can, so I got my emergency funds covered, etc. I'm financially responsible with no debt and I pay off my balances as soon as I can. But I'm still new to a lot of things.

- **Chase Checking Account** (no Savings Account)
- **Credit Card: Chase Freedom Unlimited** (my first credit card, 1yr/4mo old, $2k credit).
- **Ally High Yield Savings Account** (to build interest instead of keeping it all on my normal bank, for now it's my main interest maker as I want to learn how to approach and get comfortable with investments better.)
- **Investment Account: Charles Schwab**
    - My Roth IRA and Brokerage are in there
    - I try to max out my Roth contributions at the beginning of the year when possible.
    - My brokerage/investments can be improved, but that's another story for another time since I need to do more research before being comfortable. So far I got a grand in an index fund (SWTSX).
- **401K: Empower**
    - I match my company's match for the ""free money"". All goes into a 2060 Retirement Fund. Set and forget, but might audit and see if there's any thing I should change for efficiency.

Good start especially since pre-pandemic this was virtually non-existent. I'm 29y/o and slowly getting my life together lol, but glad I'm starting now than later. Currently figuring out the next steps and outside of learning more about investments, I'm trying to figure out what to add.

**Current Personal Finance Plan**:

- **Adding a Second Credit Card**
    - I'm thinking about adding Chase Freedom Flex and then go for one of Chase Sapphire Preferred/Reserve to complete the ""Chase Trifecta"". Deciding between Freedom Flex now, then Sapphire or get the CSP now since I'm pre-approved and then apply for Freedom Flex. Aiming to maximize benefits and eyeing travel benefits.

- **Study Basic Investing**
    - I know there's different systems like how to divide up between stocks, bonds, etc. There's also CDs, etc. I just need to figure out what's right since there's a lot of options and it feels overwhelming. For now focusing on the basic stuff. Investing in stock in companies is probably the farthest I'll go as I don't plan on getting into NFTs or Cryptos. Main priority is improving my current system.

- **Open a Schwab Bank High Yield Investor Checking Account**
    - I already have my brokerage through here. I heard it's beneficial since there's no minimum or annual/monthly fee. What opened my eyes with no foreign transaction/international fees. Would it be worth having this even if some time down the line I'll be aiming for a Chase Sapphire Card?","Status Quo Bias, Loss Aversion, Framing Effect","The user's consideration of opening a Schwab Bank High Yield Investor Checking Account is influenced by the benefits it offers, such as no foreign transaction fees, which is framed as a positive aspect.

10smdgp,sirspike345,"one of three options to do to save/pay off

What I did was consolidated all my debt twice over the last 2 years into two personal loans due to some behaviors that I have since changed and continue to work on. Not the topic for discussion. 

PL 1 -9.7k - $223 payment
PL 2 20.5k - $475 payment 

My wife has a vehicle that is not paid off yet around 8k with payments around 300-350 (extra put towards) that she alone has been paying. 

Emergency fund is around 2 months a bit less than that but some items like car insurance is paid every 6 months etc., with the ability to stretch longer if we needed to cut a bunch of items. My wife works as well. The reason why she doesn't contribute to the E-fund is she is paying her way through college right now, and the items would be like dining out less, less buying items, etc. We are in fact cutting those already so the focus doesn't need to be put here either. 

We have goals of saving for a house, so in order to do so, I am wondering what the best option is? Specifically would like to buy a house in 2 years, i am guessing it will be 3 at this rate. I have stopped contributing to the savings account as I was putting $200 every two weeks there. 

Get E Fund to 6 months? Pay off the car? Avalanche the two loans by paying off the smaller one first?

grand plan, thoughts please

So. I've posted a few times over the last few months here and personal finance and first time home buyer. I think I finally have my grand plan + direction for about 24-48 straight months if nothing changes for my wife and I, or at least nothing drastic. 
Edit: this is the order of the next 36 months for priority 
1. Pay off taxes around 4k in March. 
2. Pay off wife's car loan of 4500 in May
3. Summer/vacation planning for stuff ~around 2k (3 bachelor parties + weddings for three best friends between May-October)
4. ~14 months from now pay off consolidation loan #1 ~9k 
5. ~28 months from now Pay off consolidation loan #2 ~21k
6. Grow emergency savings from ~2 months to 6 months. 
7. Save for first time home buyers down payment. Looking to save in two parts. 10k for closing costs/extras and about 25k-35k for a down payment for a 220-250k house. (Currently around 16k saved for both these things (majority in a CD) for both e-savings and down-payment stuff. 

I have several differented allocated accounts to cover bases, investing, and overall saving that I will continue but pause the bigger amounts. Basically think Dave Ramsey 'ish because I will always continue to invest while paying off stuff. Next thing to tackle after buying a house will be both mine and my wife's student loans.

Has anyone done something like this as well? 
TL:DR - using a brokerage to create another savings account 

I have 2 savings accounts. Both with horrible yield. Taking 1 and putting into a taxable brokerage. I've been fiddling with a M1 pie for a bit and I think I finally have the right mixture of bonds/etfs to never lose more than 2%. Which yes. Sounds like a lot. But if you're a Dave Ramsey person and he says 1k at first in the bank 2% is only $20. But if it's 11% growth than it's $110. 

Yes there is more than that to it. The idea is to grow it by month. 

I will have 1 savings account set at 1k. 

Than I will have the 2nd emergency account go from 500-1500, when it reaches 1500 I will sell $500 and place that into a new high yield savings account so I won't lose. 
Than get to 2500 and put 500 more into the HYS, than get to 3500 and so on and so forth until I get 6 months of emergency savings into my brokerage. 

The idea is for a dual component. Knowing I have 1 safety net with the 1k than growing 1 to grow another for a total of 3. The brokerage will turn into saving for a house after 6 months of savings. 

There are risks to this. 
1. Taxable brokerage. Means I gotta pay taxes... not great. But I'm in a low tax bracket and when I sell for capital gains I need to make sure I have money for taxes later. 
2. Taxable brokerage also means ups and downs in the stock market. Lots of risk. Which is why I tried to come up with some good mixture of items to the point where nearly every item in the US will need to tank. I have to do a little more digging into this for negative correlation for the etf growth stuff. 
3. People will say I'm ""over thinking"" with ""too many options"" but once this starts there won't be much to lose if I make my money back. And I'm not looking to gain $$$ over night. Just a long term saving method. 

Andddd it's basically free money from when my great grandparents give me some money when I was like 5 and it was left in a savings account and it's only grown.

But I have 1k there. Now, I decided to do two more things. 1. Hold $500-1k cash. 2. Use robinhood gold and have $500-1k sitting there using the 3.5% monthly interest. 

So goal by next summer I will be on my way to my 3-6 months emergency fund with goals of $1k+ in each one, with four levels of liquidity and growth. 

From most liquid/low growth to highest

1. Cash (1K)
2. Bank savings account ($1k)
3. Robinhood Gold brokerage ($1k)
4. M1 finance E-fund pie ($1k+)

Many will say this is a silly idea, but pairing the compound interest with safety and in the market will be key for an emergency fund that people only touch in emergencies.

So... I was trying to figure out some savings account stuff. Didn't get it done properly and screwed myself a tad but it's fixable. I just left a job. I got my PTO paid out, etc. Now I have a decent chunk in my checking. I was going to pay a bit down on my credit cards as the usage is way too high. But I found a huge issue. I have 1 more 40 hour check coming from the job, but I had put down to pay an extra $20 per pay period for federal taxes, but it took ONLY $20 for federal taxes. So now I'm screwed.

Looking for some basic info and feedback about MBAâ€™s!

Disclaimer: I have little knowledge on graduate degrees. Just starting to research.

(Posted this in MBA community but not much luck)

&amp;#x200B;

Background:

* 24 M
* Working in Occupational Safety
* Washington D.C. Metro area
* Graduated with a B.S. in Occupational Safety (3.88 GPA) from smaller D2 school in Pennsylvania
* Never been the best student but I really buckled down in college and found a love for education and worked hard for a good GPA. I credit making it this far in life from common sense and street smarts!
* Part time officer in the Air Force
* Salary: 100K  

   * Project Salary: 125K by age 26 (step 1 promotion)
   * 160K by 30 (step 2 promotion)
   * Both salary projections are with no graduate degree
* Employer: Electrical Power/ Transportation Contractor  

   * 1000ish employees
   * 500 million per year revenue
   * Does not offer continuing education benefits

Goals:

Iâ€™ve always been interested in finances and the business side of the company.

We donâ€™t have a large number of professionals in our career field (Occupational Safety) that peruse advanced degrees so I feel like this would be a great advantage for me.

Iâ€™m mostly interested in an MBA but would also consider a Masterâ€™s of Science.

My idea is this degree would be great to put me on track for a Director position, Vice President, or any equivalent Executive position.

I have the potential to open my own business later on down the road and I also do real estate investing so a program where you have some solid business takeaways is a must.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

Given I may have to pay for this out of pocket Iâ€™m trying to find a balance between a reasonable cost and a program that has a good reputation.

Is this realistic? Or should I just be looking at this as a check in the box and networking opportunity?

I donâ€™t even understand the rankings.

Itâ€™s tough to rationalize when my undergrad is already making me 100K with 50K upside potential over the next 10 years.

Iâ€™ll be working full time in the DC area while perusing this so itâ€™ll have to be a part time or online program.

I will consider doctorate level degrees down the road after.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

Does any specific programs jump out?

So I opened my IRA at the beginning of 2020 and had the great idea that I didnâ€™t wanna miss the boat on the 2019 contribution. Couldnâ€™t have waited a monthâ€¦

So were in the red just about -$2,000 in a month.

   * Wife is graduating with a bachelors in industrial engineering/ will be employed by summer or soâ€¦hopefully
* No kids
   * Our plan is to wait for the next 3-5 years
* Credit: 790
* I consider myself moderately educated on finances and frugal
* Career: Occupational safety manager for an electrical infrastructure contractor
* As youâ€™ll see in the breakdown below my gross income for the year is roughly 85K between both my jobs
   * I manage to make another 10K tax free from travel pays throughout the year
* The general career progression Iâ€™m in line for is:
   * Current position â€“ 80K
   * Manager â€“ 100K (I anticipate this in the next 1-2 years)
   * Regional manager â€“ 150K (Anticipated in the next 5-7 years)
   * Director â€“ 200-250K (Anticipated in the next 15+ years)
* Part time career in the military
   * Currently an officer select
   * Six years of service
   * I anticipate to do 30 years and retire as a O-5 or O-6
* Notable military benefits:
   * Pension
   * Thrift Savings Plan
   * Second income
   * â€œUnemployment insuranceâ€ if I was to ever lose my primary job, AKA I can ask them to put me full time if they have funding
   * Consistent access to healthcare outside my regular employer
   * Paid for my college and expense
   * Will pay for a portion of my masters
   * I will acquire one if not two more paid for college educations for my dependents throughout the remainder of my career
   * All budgeting is done through mint/ personal capital

# Gross Income/ Taxes/ Expenses

I have three sources of income: Primary employer, part time military, and my wifeâ€™s contributions

# Income

* Primary employer: $1,545.04/ week - $6,180.16 / month (Gross)
   * Non-taxable Auto Payment: $400 / month
      * I use my own vehicle for work
   * Unlimited fuel card use
   * 3% base pay raise annual across the board
   * Annual bonus of about one weekâ€™s pay per year
* Military: $385.52 / month
* Wife contribution: $720 / month
   * Rent/food

&amp;#x200B;

Gross Monthly Income Total: $7,685.68

# Taxes

* Primary employer: $423.03 / week - $1,692.12 / month
* Military: $87.14/ monthly

&amp;#x200B;

Taxes Total: $1,779.26

# Expenses

* Auto Insurance: $68
* Auto Payment: $250
* Electric: $53
   * Past 6 month average
* Gas Utility: $45
   * Past 6 month average
* Internet: $52
* Cell Phone: $43
* Groceries/ household essentials: $600
   * I realize Iâ€™ll probably get heat here for this being high. I shop at Wegmans which I think has substantially better quality food than say a Walmart. I still go to Walmart for the name brand items that wouldnâ€™t make a difference where you bought them from. Iâ€™ve tried to get the cost down but I just canâ€™t seem to. At the end of the day I consider what I eat to be an investment into my future health and a reward for cutting corners in other areas. Eating shitting can really add up physically and mentally over time.
* Gym: $69
* Home Insurance: $14
* Rent: $1,502
* Spending Money: $400
   * This is everything outside of the mentioned expense categories. Going out to eat, entertainment, amazon purchases, etc. Iâ€™m pretty frugal but usually random things come up (birthday gifts, car maintenance) that dip into this. I usually end up spending most this on a monthly basis but if I donâ€™t I roll it into savings.
* Left over each month: $33.26

&amp;#x200B;

Expenses total: $3,129.26/ month

&amp;#x200B;

* Any large purchases outside of my routine expenses I either plan and save case by case or justify accordingly within means. Example: I donâ€™t usually save up for vacations but I know every few years Iâ€™ll end up spending about $2,500 for me and my wife. Itâ€™s pretty common sense here, donâ€™t go into debt buying it and donâ€™t make a bad purchase whatever it is.

&amp;#x200B;

# Investing/ Net Worth

# Monthly Summary

Percentages reflect the ratio of my gross monthly income or 100%

   * (Savings With Matches: $3,167.24 â€“ 41.21% - extra 5.07%)
* Debt: $3,726.45 (Total owed not monthly)

# Savings

&amp;#x200B;

**Short Term:**

* Home Down Payment: $1200 - 15.61%

Total Short Term: $1200 - 15.61%

**Long Term:**

* Roth 401K: $927.04 - 12.06%
   * Match: $370.80 â€“ Extra: 4.82%

   * Match: $19.28 â€“ Extra â€“ 0.25%
      * Total With Match: $96.4 â€“ 1.25%
* College Funds: $73 - 0.95%

Total Long Term (excluding kids funds): $1,894.24 - 24.65%

&amp;#x200B;

# Retirement Calculations

* Estimations based off my current track
   * Assumptions:
      * Withdrawal age: 65
      * Rate of return 7%
* Roth 401K value â€“ $5.5 million ($4.2 mil after expenses)
* Roth IRA Value â€“ $1.25 million
* Military Pension Value â€“ 900K to 2.9 mil
   * I realize this is a huge spread but its largely based on how many years I serve, amount of service and rank I retire
* Thrift Savings Plan Value â€“ 485K to 1.2 mil
   * Again, big spread, same as aboveâ€¦
* Social Security â€“ 5K approximately monthly
   * Really not accounting for this much

**Monthly Totals**: By my math, the above values work out to just over **50K per month** when retired at 65 with a 20 year distribution

&amp;#x200B;

# Future Goals

* Overall I realize Iâ€™m in pretty good shape and if I hold this course Iâ€™ll easily be a multi-millionaire by the time I retire
* Worth noting once my wife is employed full time sheâ€™ll be making a similar income to me and following a similar investing strategy. So basically weâ€™ll have double whatâ€™s listed above.
* Obviously like everyone I donâ€™t know what the future holds but Iâ€™ve always seen myself retiring somewhat early (45-55) and enjoying a moderately higher lifestyle from the work Iâ€™ve put in now.
* Sidebar story â€“ Itâ€™s funny but growing up in the lower middle class a friend of mine and myself made a personal goal to make our first million by 30. We still talk about it to this day. This still remains a goal of mine even though I know at my current rate this will be tough.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

1. Continue my natural career progression and capitalize on the high income/ strong investing base Iâ€™ve already build

&amp;#x200B;

2. FIND THE NEXT STEP - I want to focus on aggressively taking the next step to build wealth with this strong base Iâ€™ve listed as my foundation.

* This will most likely be in real estate as Iâ€™ve spent the past year researching/building up capital
   * Having a tough time deciding between investing in the HCOL area of the DMV or go out of town to buy
* Whatever I do in real-estate my general plan is to continue to acquire income producing properties at an exponential rate starting at 1 per year, 2 per year, 4 and so onâ€¦.easier said than done I realize but thatâ€™s the plan
* Most likely me or my wife obtain a real estate license in this process
* Other considerations are once I have enough experience in my field, open a consulting firm or other business venture that I can scale

&amp;#x200B;

3. Lower my taxable liability (*Legally)* â€“ I have little knowledge on this right now but I know this will be a huge advantage to scaling my wealth once I have the ability to do this.

* I know this will really only come into play when I have real-estate or a business of some sort, but Iâ€™m taking steps with an CPA and establishing an LLC so Iâ€™m ready when the time comes

&amp;#x200B;

4. Continue my education with a graduate degree

* This is something Iâ€™ll need to do in order to break into the top tier positions in both my careers, in addition to being a personal goal
* Iâ€™ve already began to scout some better affordable programs such as Oklahoma State or Ball State and at a reach VT or PSB
* My budget is 15-25K out of pocket. The military will help pay for about 10K of this

&amp;#x200B;

5. Open a HSA

* Something else Iâ€™m not very versed in yet but from what I understand my company will match $1500 per year on top of my contribution of $5600 for the $7100 (married couple) annual max
* Is this something good for me?

&amp;#x200B;

6. Backdoor IRA

* Once my wife and I are capped for our IRAâ€™s I want to continue investing via a Roth conversion
* Do any high earners do this? How is it working for you? Or should I be looking at an alternative?

Iâ€™m a reserve military member thus Iâ€™m eligible for Tricare Reserve Select insurance. 

The general consensus is this is great insurance with low premium ($230 a month for a family), low deductible ($313 a year) and low co-pays.

guob77,sm_098,"Invest in my business or elsewhere?

TLDR: I have a nice little cash flow business that generates $300-400k without me being too tied up (though I am definitely involved day to day). Should I try to grow that or take the profit and invest elsewhere (stocks, real estate, buy another business and build that)?

Ive been running a small creative agency for about 5 years. Weâ€™ve grown revenue every year but I have invested very little money in the business â€”itâ€™s been almost entirely organic plus some sweat equity on my part. Im wondering, should I finally invest in the business to try and scale our growth, or should I take profits and invest elsewhere (real estate, stock market, buying a new business, etc).  
 

Here are some important notes

&amp;#x200B;

* We are not doing huge numbers, right around half a million. 
* Margin is pretty high, around 80% if you don't include my salary, around 50% if you do. 
* I have delegated a good chunk of the work but I'm still pretty hands-on day to day. 
* I have avoided making that BIG hire that would likely remove me from the day-to-day because I've been scared to pay someone 100k to do the job properly (20% of our revenue).
* I have a belief (whether itâ€™s true or not) that there is a natural ceiling to the amount of revenue an agency like mine can generate. I know there are massive agencies out there that do millions of dollars, but I don't want to own a 100 person agency. Even if I busted my ass for the next few years I doubt we could get over 1M (versus other types of investments that have a higher return potential)

Potential areas for investment within the business:

&amp;#x200B;

* Spending money on paid advertising 
* Hiring full-time employees who are more qualified therefore removing me from even more of the business ops.
* Freeing up my time to focus solely on getting more work from our current client base or assemble other strategic marketing

I'm trying to work backward and figure out what would need to be the case financially in order to afford my $6M dream home... 

Hereâ€™s where Iâ€™m at, let me know what I'm missing and where I've made bad assumptions!

&amp;#x200B;

**What do I need to be worth?**

* 20% down - $1.2M
* \+ $200k buffer... Not totally sure what this would be for but just in case. 
* \+50K for furnishings
* $1.4M\~ needed
* \*I don't think I'd want to put my entire life savings down so I'll assume that $1.45M  represents maybe 70% of net worth? (Am I off here? Should it be more or less?)
* Net worth = $2.1M *(So at the very least I'd need to have a net worth of $2.1M\~)*

**What would my monthly income need to be?**

Home costs: $28,500 per month

* P&amp;I: $22,858
* Taxes: $3,050
* Insurance: $2,100
* Maintenance: $500

Assuming that my home costs would be max 25% of my income

* 28500x4 = $114,000 per month
* $1.37M per year

Investments / Savings

* I'd still want to dedicate some of my monthly income to savings/outside investments
* However, since the home is partially investment, I'll aim to invest and additional 10% monthly into other investments like the stock market, etc. 
* This 10% would be included in the 75% of my expenses not dedicated to the Home category which I assumed previously, so I wont add it additionally as that is already covered. 

**Outcome**

I'd need to have a *Net Worth of at least $2.1M* \+ comfortably make *$1.37M per year*.

mxrzat,sm_098,"Rent v. Buy â€” best of both worlds?

Hey everyone, I've really been struggling with the decision to a) rent + invest in stocks or b) buy a home. A strategy has been recommended to me a few times that seems to allow maybe the best of both worlds. I'm trying to get some clarity around as I don't fully understand it, but it does sound intriguing. 

Essentially the concept seems to be:

* Buy something on the lower end (small SFH or Condo)
* Live there for a few years and pay aggressively toward the mortgage to build equity.
* Then at some point (I'm not clear on when this could happen), you borrow against the equity in the home to either a) invest in stocks or b) put a down payment on a bigger home while renting on the first home. 

Relevant info:

* I live in Los Angeles // 30+ years old
* No family
* Have about 500k in cash/general investments available for whatever I decide to do and can comfortably afford up to 10k per month possibly more if needed.

So my main two questions are:

1. How can I learn more about this process
2. Does this sound like a reasonable strategy?

epvuhq,Snaebakabeans,"2 year plan make sense?

So I've learned that my aggressive plans never pan out with my wife and I so I decided to make a conservative plan and wanted feedback.

Salaries (post tax)
Mine: $3500/month
Hers: $4000/month
Commission (me): $200-2000/month
Bonus (me): 500-5000/quarter
Bonus (her): 500/quarter

401k (her): 10%
401k (me): 4%
Roth IRA (me): 6%

Debts
House: 180k (3.5%) 
Car 1: 18k (2.9%)
Car 2: 17k (0.9%)
Student loans (to employer): 2.2k
Federal: 5k

Expenses/bills
House: 1400
Insurance: 150
Cell phone: 130
Utilities: 320
Doggy daycare: 280
Dogs specific diet/Medicines/supplements: 250
Gas: 300
Food: 400

Right now credit cards are zero and staying that way

Current plan:
We pay $1,000/month per car which will pay off both cars within 18 months. My repayment to my previous job for student loans is $250 and my federal is 70. Once my employer is repaid, I will add the 250 to the federal. Any commissions and bonus will go towards paying down student loans.

So we do have some money left over, some goes into savings some goes towards spend and we've been good so far now that credit cards are gone. I've noticed that using debit cards we spend less.

2 year plan:

We will be selling our house. It's a new townhome built in 180 and comps around my neighborhood have sold for 250+. The issue is, the HOA is mandating us to put a deck on by the year 2021 and needs to have one before it's sold. That will cost us 5k, so we will use our tax return and no touch our growing nest egg for that. We will buy a cheaper 80-100k home on a short 15 year mortgage closer to family and use the equity to renovate it (which is ideal because it will keep the taxes down).

At that point, we will also have next to no debt making more than double our expenses and plan to start going on some nice vacations and investing more into retirement. The only downside is, we are right now living decent. We go out to eat twice a week, we will go on 3 mini vacations (costing between 500-800/each) but will be paying for all of them with cash. We will be gifting her sister $1500 as a thank you for her bday for helping my wife our years ago and I am spending $800ish on my wife's 30th birthday. But my goal is to do all of this with cash and using as little savings as possible.

We are in a stupid aggressive sellers market, houses are getting 6-10 offers within 48 hours of listing which is nuts. Our house should list around 260k and we owe 185k. We are looking at houses under 190k. My dad offered us the other day to sell and move in with him which is great.

guuy38,Snaebakabeans,"Buying a house right now sucks!!!

So long story short we have to move soon. HOA is being a B about dogs and despite my dog not causing any issues, they are threatening to fine people.

Anyway, our monthly net income is around $7,600 including my wife's VA Disability. I do get nice bonuses but due to COVID-19 that doesn't look likely for awhile. 

We owe 185k on our townhome and my agent is suggesting a list price of 265k. Houses are selling like hotcakes.

We are trying to stay around 190k which with taxes (we are in PA, so the highest taxes per dollar of any state?) Which puts this mortgage (15 year) close to what we are paying on our 30 year. 

But because of this market, people are way overpaying for houses pushing the prices way over market value. So we are considering building again but these numbers are hard to swallow.

3 bedroom
2bath
Price: 300k
Taxes: $8,600 (next county over)

m7z678,Snaebakabeans,"If you're buying a house with plans to move up in house in 5 years, don't buy a house right now.

So all around the country we are seeing horror stories of people unable to buy a house because there are 20 plus offers within 24 hours and people are bidding well over asking price for houses that are already 20 to 30% more expensive than they were just 16 months ago.

What this is going to lead to is in 3 to 5 years when the market does stabilize a lot of these houses, especially older ones will actually have a decent drop in their value. A newer house can expect to appreciate in its first five years but older home is generally appreciate maybe a few percent year over year and a lot of that may have to do with other factors such as the area and school district.

Here's a good example, four years ago we are looking at a split it was completely renovated for $140,000 in my area but we ultimately didn't go with it because the renovation wasn't done that well. We opted to build an 1842 square foot townhome for about 200,000. The houses around us that were built around the same time have sold for close to 300,000 meaning the appreciation has been about 50% in just four years.

The houses that we were looking at in 2016 are now currently selling for around $200,000 to 220,000. But historically you will have seen that over the last 10 years those houses that were selling for 140,000 may have sold for around 110,000 to 120,000 back in 2010.

So what will happen is those houses that sold for $200-220k will probably drop to about 150-170k in a 3-5 years. However people will in 5 years about still owe 180-200k, and be under water unless they put 20% down. However many of these loans are FHA which require much less down.

So when people are looking to move out of their first starter home not only will they have no equity they actually will owe more money on it than when it's worth and be unable to move and expand their family or have to cram more people into house that can't naturally accommodate it.

So people that are desperate for a house and are overbidding for houses that are already overpriced, just note that you will LOSE your butt if you plan on selling in 5-7 years.

sl9j7t,Snaebakabeans,"Beware of dealerships selling cars at ""MSRP""

Finally found the car I've been looking for in the color I wanted. The dealers around me in SW PA are selling most vehicles for MSRP. So I spend some time researching my trade. KBB says 23-24.8k on trade in with very good condition. We buy any car says 23.5k, Algo says 23.8k and CarMax says 23.6k. Car is being retailed for 26-27k, only 2 within 100 miles because the car is in demand (mine)

My car has all of his maintenance and receipts uploaded to car fax,, garage kept, never smoked and lower mileage for it's year (41k and 2018k). Get to the dealer to do paperwork and they come back at 20k. I'm confused AF, my number was 23k. The ""best"" they could do is 21k. So I walked. I get it, they gotta have the detail department charge them $1,000 to clean it up for sale, but the oil isn't due for another 7k (I changed it every 5k miles despite the book calling for 10k tho). Brand new all seasons and inspection good until end of the year.

So lesson learned, dealers offering cars at MSRP are probably going to lowball the crap out of your trade, they gotta gouge you somewhere!

TLDR: I did extensive research to find out my car should trade in between 23 and 25,000 with a suggested retail price of $27,000 it was promptly offered only $20,000 followed up by $21,000 is their best offer it was most likely because since they sell cars at MSRP they have to gouge on your trade, when I was only asking for 23,000 which is the lowest end of all my car was worth on the average tradin.","Anchoring, Confirmation Bias, Self-Attribution Bias","The user exhibits Anchoring bias by relying heavily on the initial trade-in values provided by various sources (KBB, We Buy Any Car, Algo, and CarMax), which averaged around $23.6k, to anchor their expected trade-in value.

tf1d77,Snaebakabeans,"issues with car purchase

So in the middle of February I purchased a 2022 Genesis g70 the deal the dealership tried to put together got kicked by the bank and it could not buy down the rate to the amount they promised so they had to take money off the car which is fine.

Since then the paperwork has been kicked twice in my first payment supposed to be due in 9 days but I don't even have an auto loan and I've been driving this car for a month. For my understanding I'm basically driving a dealer car at the moment because the paperwork has not even been approved by the bank yet.

The issue isn't my credit my credit came back at 820 it's just the finance person keeps messing up the paperwork when they submit the application. So what is my recourse if the deal has to be unwound since I had a car that was traded in and I was supposed to get $14,000 of net equity towards new car plus my down payment on top of that?

thc0jj,Snaebakabeans,"After a month of headaches, I got my car at MSRP...

At the end of last year we paid off my wife's two year old car and we talked about potentially upgrading my car since we have drastically changed our position for the better and now we can finally look to make some more fun decisions and purchases.

I had a few year old VW GTI and i wanted something different. It didn't fit my personality or life style, wasn't as fast as I wanted for the track and lacked all the modern safety and technology features.

So after month of research I settled on a Genesis g70 3.3t all wheel drive sport prestige. It's a little more than what I want to spend but after the wife and I talked it's about a third of our yearly income and we have no debt outside the house and we have fully funded retirements with 10% going into it.

So I spent a month tracking one down to find out that every dealership within 300 miles had all her allocations accounted for in the next four to six months. Finally I got a call one day that dealership had the trim that I wanted coming in and at the previous buyer backed out. They didn't know this but it was also the exact color combination I wanted too.

We talked numbers and they had over 2,300 worth of add-ons that I didn't want and the lowest I can negotiate it down was the $1,400. I wasn't thrilled but it was everything I wanted and I knew that I couldn't just simply say no and find the car and wanted readily available so after they valued my trade out a decent price I put down deposit and wait for the car to come in.

I arrived at the dealership the day after it arrived and when I went in the finance we got into a pretty strong negotiation because they were trying to sell additional add-ons and after it's all said and done I end up paying about $400 less a month and one additional add-on but they bought down the promotional rate the 1.5%. I threatened to walk during the conversation.

Everything's fine dandy until I get a call 2 weeks later saying the paperwork did not go through and I would have to resign. No issues I did and had a week later she told me that they could not get approved below the promotional right at 1.9% and I told her that's fine I will be up this weekend to return the car and to get my car back. She assured me that would not be necessary and that they could discount some things and keep the monthly payment the same and I reviewed the paperwork and signed it and send it back, 1.7% was the rate.

The bank kicked it once again because they were trying to get a rate below the 1.9% promotional rate and I told the finance person that I would be coming up on Thursday to return the car before I go on vacation mind you I have a thousand miles on this car if they don't get this done and approved before I leave.

I got a call for Thursday morning and told me that they could not get below the 1.9% promotional rate and I told her that's fine I'll be out this afternoon and she said no we discounted all the extra add-ons to zero and you'll get the promotional rate in the car at sticker. I reviewed the paperwork to verify this to be true so I got a ceramic coating add-on which according to my brother's professional detailer is actually half decent and a wheel and tire repair and maintenance package for free and the car at sticker.","Loss Aversion, Sunk Cost Fallacy, Anchoring","The user's decision-making process is influenced by several biases.

So my dad is retired and is looking at moving the remaining of his Hellcat from an auto loan to his heloc. He owns his home owes like 15k on the car (2022 was 88k).

in8ork,SnorkelHouse,"Is there truly a risk tolerance when you invest in major ETFS over the long run?

I am filling out my own ""risk tolerance"" for a fiduciary service and essentially it boils down to what combination portfolio you want divided between etfs/mututalfunds/other stocks and bonds.

I understand your portfolio can go up and down, but isnt the general expectation for the past 90 years that etfs like vtsax and sp500 will play out in financial returns.

ixe4ef,SnorkelHouse,"Sudden nervousness about the sp500 and what you would classify ""run for the hills/doomsday scenario""

I am a very new investor. I had a lot of my windfall thanks to my father. Because I am new I have found 2 financial advisors I like (enough) and have trusted them with about 400 K in assets each- total 800 K of about 3mm in cash that I have.

At 25 my plan was to follow buffets advice and sp500 for the remaining 20-30 years as my house is all paid off, and my job pays me well enough, and I have other funds and rentals adding to that income.

Today while asking my advisor about the worst economic scenarios, I found out the NASDAQ fell almost 80% in the early 2000's. This was a major set back because while I have been following advice around sp500 and vtsax for such a long time I did not expect such a diversified ticker could fall so hard.
