I would like to transition from living at home to owning a piece of property, preferably under 400k. 

For context, I am 28 and my 401k is at 20 (I probably should be lowering it) I will make 90-100k range gross this year and probably slightly more in the future.

I would feel comfortable at 110-120 range, how would you guys go about achieving that?","Present Bias, Status Quo Bias, Anchoring","The statement exhibits several biases. The individual's primary concern is short-term financial goals, specifically saving for a home purchase, which indicates a Present Bias, as they are prioritizing immediate needs over long-term goals, such as retirement savings. Additionally, their plan to allocate funds towards a home purchase without significantly adjusting their retirement contributions (currently at $20, possibly due to a Status Quo Bias, where they are hesitant to change their current allocation) suggests a reluctance to deviate from their current financial setup.

I was hoping before I decided how much to contribute, weâ€™d do a financial analysis. I brought all of my paperwork for it. But it was the guyâ€™s anniversary and he asked if we could do the analysis later, and invited to check both me and my partnerâ€™s financials. Is it strange that I picked a monthly contribution without him analyzing my finances?

Is it possible to call when they open at 9 and withdraw or withhold my application (heâ€™s supposed to submit it today) until Iâ€™m aware of the fees and have had my finances evaluated?

Edit: how do I go about cancelling or withdrawing my application? Do I say I am having reservations and would like to wait before submitting my reply?

Hello! Iâ€™m (24-25f) about to move in with roommates to cut down on rent and be closer to uni. I have 2 jobs and a hobby that pays, and Iâ€™m in grad school. One of the jobs is a temporary contract that is set to end in August 2022 but may end sooner if the program ends or if I eventually get fired from being too tired to work (slight joke, slight hope but itâ€™s great work and great for my resume). Anywho, I am hoping to get advice on how to allocate my income now that my expenses will be reduced. 

At my FT job, I make $17.85 an hour with an annual 3% increase and health insurance for like $250 a pay check, I think. Health insurance will start getting taken out beginning February 2022. I work 36 hours a week. I think thatâ€™s $1,224 a month. 

At my temporary job, I make $19 an hour and work 32 hours a week, although Iâ€™ve been working a little less lately bc Iâ€™ve been tired af now that Iâ€™ve started my field placement twice a week for my MSW. I think thatâ€™s $1,216 a month. 

I typically donâ€™t count my income from my hobby but itâ€™s at $12 an hour, 6 hours a week. 

Now that my rent is going down from $1079 plus utilities to $600 (no utilities), I am wondering what to do with that â€œextraâ€ income. I also pay $1,217.58 every 6 months for car insurance, $90 a month for my phone bill, $9 for Netflix, probably like $50 a month for gas, and I spend a lot on food (Iâ€™d guess $500 a month for me and my partner). Oh and probably about $300 a month for entertainment.  That comes to about $1,550 a month with $890 left over. 

How should I allocate $890 a month? Once the contact runs up, Iâ€™m strongly considering NOT replacing the temporary job. Will I be able to sustain that? I have about 18k saved up with 9k going to completely cover my student loans unsubsidized loans when they start to accrue interest.","Present Bias, Mental Accounting","The user's statement reveals a present-focused mindset, characteristic of Present Bias, as they are primarily concerned with allocating their current ""extra"" income of $890 per month without thoroughly considering long-term implications.

Iâ€™m having a hard time trusting anywhere. I donâ€™t know much about this, maybe I should pay for a financial advisor tbh. 

My company is supposed to do a 3% match but says we donâ€™t have a provider right now. They told me to go to https://www.capitalgroup.com/individual/, choose individual investor, and then find a provider. Once I do that give them my companyâ€™s name as the â€œsponsorâ€ and my payroll deduction plan number. Does this mean once I found a provider, they will match my contributions?

They sent that in may of 2021. I was overwhelmed with it all and quit basically. I met with primerica but it felt scammy. So I put my money in an account that earns 3% APY.

I am feeling defeated. Iâ€™ve been house hunting for awhile and have come to terms with the fact that now may just not be the time for me. I have great credit and a sizeable down payment but my debt to income ratio is too high for the condos I tend to like. My realtor is about done and asked me if I want to pray about it today (LOL, im agnostic) so I guess sheâ€™s tired of being my agent. Should I just give it up and spend my money elsewhere?

Iâ€™ve been thinking of other ways to become financially wealthy or set myself up for success (25f). Maybe I should just open a simple IRA with my job so I can get a match. Iâ€™ve been holding off bc I was saving all income for buying a house (eventual investment property). The other part of it is idk that I want to be here forever but I didnâ€™t think that would matter much since I can live in it until my partner and I marry and move and then rent it out since it would be near uni.

I think I would just keep the downpayment and emergency fund and plan to invest incoming money into simple IRA, that way I still have liquid funds to use for those goals.

Hey yâ€™all, please lmk if Iâ€™m on the right track. Iâ€™m in graduate school and Iâ€™ve been getting financial aid and will continue for the next two years.

16zc1ly,happy2lucky,"Question on long term care insurance

Hello All-

I am sure some of you may have gone through this analysis at some point. 

I am searching on this desperately but not able to find comprehensive information. I am 43, F and expecting some long term care needs. I read a few articles around long term care insurance, hybrid insurance with LTC rider and Annuities with LTC rider

We (married filing jointly) max out our pretax 401k, HSA and do backdoor/mega Roth periodically depending on cash situation. Generally we are late starters in our career (my husband started working at 33 and I started at 35). He is 47 and I am 43 now. So there are balances but not huge ones. We plan to retire in late 50s

We have zero inheritance money wise but life wise our ancestors mostly lived into their early 90s ðŸ˜€ðŸ˜€. Some of them needed long term care. I developed a condition that â€˜mayâ€™ need long term care.

Some questions I have:
1. I see that traditional IRA is a better way to save for long term care needs because of tax benefit. 
However, traditional IRA also kicks in RMDs which would eventually decrease my Social Security. Would that be the case when I claim RMDs for my long term care credits? Will I still have the tax torpedo?

2. Regardless of savings in Traditional IRA, I feel the need for additional income stream to cover for my long term care needs. I see that there are three options:
a. Long term care insurance (I am ruling this out because I heard the policies are no longer reliable or good with benefits. Moreover they are use it or lose it ones)
b. Hybrid life insurance- permanent life insurance with Long term care rider
c. Deferred Annuity with long term care rider

I am not sure what are the differences between b and c. 

What are the features that weigh for them and against them?

3. Medicaid eligibility:
I read that having cash value life insurance policies and annuities weigh against you for Medicaid claims around long term care. 

Point to note though, my spouse and I are not low income earners. Not high but not low either. I am wondering if I should even bother about Medicaid at this point?
 

Apologies for such a long post, but I am really looking to cover for my retirement and given long term care needs that my health demands, trying to be financially and physically responsible. Appreciate any insight you may have

mm1lun,happy2lucky,"Transfer (from community college) vs freshman

Hello all-  My kids are no way near to college. Trying to understand the community college route vs regular freshmen.  

What are the opportunity costs ( for now letâ€™s assume it is for a decent out of state college)
- at undergraduate level?
- in terms of long term career?

I think I am good if they get into in state tuition (GA covers with HOPE scholarship, and I think I am okay with boarding costs). I also believe he has good chances to get into UGA. However, I am currently wondering about 2 scenarios below:

My son (rising 9th grader) does dream of Stanford/UCLA - mostly influenced by his friends who moved from CA (I am originally from LA too, so no issues there). However, I want him to be realistic with out of state tuition funding and debts. So in case he wants to persist with these choices with his current Bs, I would want him to buy some extra time at a community college. Although I wonder if it is even possible to a CA university from a GA community college. 

Question here: Is it possible?

GA Tech: I am also wondering of a scenario where he does not make the GPA cut that is needed for HOPE scholarship and therefore should buy some time at community college till they take to the rigor to head out to CA universities for better career prospects. I donâ€™t think community college to GA Tech is nearly possible (very tough competition). His interest is in sciences (health/bio etc)

Are there any long term career impacts if they do not join as freshman? I can bring in a bit of additional savings, and may be some loans if the â€˜freshmanâ€™ tag is really worth it. But I am more inclined to community college and then CA, this way we can buy time and reduce stress.

Backdoor done. mega Roth eligibilities not existing. Will top up when we hit 50. I am a private tutor and can pool up that money
2. Did reasonable college funding (75k NW in each childâ€™s 529 account. They are 14 and 11)
3. Only my employer offers High deductible plan and I take for only me. So HSA is saved for individual NOT family 
4. We have a home and 300k mortgage. Good prepayment going on (about $450 extra pm)
5. We have a term policy for 30 years that expires when we turn 70. We expect to live up to 90

Now the freaking questions:

I reached out to a neighborhood advisor because I heard of these insurance income paying plans that payout living+death benefit. I was hoping some guaranteed inheritance to kids upon our death (term is guaranteed only if I die before 70)

This guy confused me by changing assumptions once every minute. It was a 2 hour presentation and I understood â€˜Nilâ€™. It shows millions being built with thousands and millions in death benefit. I just got confused between all changing numbers and assumptions. It was frustrating. Someone please help me understand the below:

what am I looking for? 

- I am looking to pass down some death benefit to kids (which would be their living benefit)

- retirement distribution plan:

Ages 60-70 - traditional IRA/401k;
Ages 70-80 - SS + Roth accounts;
Ages 80-90 - SS + This insurance income; (I hope to die and pass on some benefit to kids to cover my funeral cost)
Ages 90 plus - I donâ€™t know, itâ€™s kids fate.

This idiotic advisor confused me to the core. I donâ€™t know what is the best move.

Do these policies deliver on their promise? Will these really cover for me in my 80s?

He suggested some 40k premium for 5 years (my 41 to 45) and some 90k income per year (80-90) and I think 50k death benefit. 

On my request he put the growth rate assumption to 6% for the above policy.

mtx03y,happy2lucky,"Funding college with rental property??

Hello All

I posted this question on Dave Ramsey Reddit thread. Sorry if some of you may have to reread it.

So here is the question. I was told about a long term strategy to fund kids education. On the book this looks pitch perfect. Not sure if this works in real world and real money, because things are barely certain here. Can someone explain the â€˜unseenâ€™ downside of this?

So here is how the strategy works. When a baby is born:

1. Find a rental property and down 20%
2. Get a 15 year mortgage 
3. Find tenants who will pay well above the monthly payment 
4. Use that rent to pay off mortgage 
5. The home is paid up by renter in 15 years
6. Just about the college time, refi the home with 80% cash out. This is a non taxable event 
7. The renter paying the mortgage cycle restarts

The extra rent collected covers the maintenance and vacant costs over 15 years is the idea (while tax benefits from depreciation and mortgage also add up to this benefit)

I donâ€™t know if this really works but this is the strategy. I may not do this (my kids are 14&amp;11), but curious to understand.

Our car ran itâ€™s course. We have to buy a new car. Itâ€™s time.

Our point is, with new tax credits is it worth to buy an EV? I am going to use it for a very long time for sure. 

My husband says EV saves on gas, credits (GA) and other stuff. He is saying total cost of ownership is less for EVs. I really donâ€™t know anything about cars. He has not set his mind on it and open to ideas if they make sense monetarily.

p9z4dc,happy2lucky,"IUL/VUL question- not buying for learning and general awareness only

Hello peeps 

I understand IUL/VUL are for high earners only. We are high earners but started way too late in life and therefore we donâ€™t have net worth enough to go for IUL/VUL

Our high earnings will help us fund retirement accounts and to some extent college accounts (not interested in full funding for kids). With the rest of the money I was thinking of permanent life policies.

Again, I donâ€™t think I should buy one, but I am curious on who are the eligible buyers for this without losing money? If I buy for my kids (who are 14&amp;11) would that be beneficial?

The reason I ask is: these policies are good for people with high net worth and taxable estates. I donâ€™t have estates but if I live the simple life I am in and keep earning the same for next 20+ years my kids might have an estate. So wondering if it is for individuals like them?

The idea is not to buy, but to understand this product. Every other month some or the other advisor chances upon me with different variations of this product (IUL/VUL/FIUL/IA/VA) and all the riders. Every one I know runs away from these guys (so do I), then who are they selling to? Just curious on how can I really use this product into my asset mix, if at all.

Hi peeps-

My spouse switched jobs. 

His previous employer offered after tax and with all the calculations I estimated employers contribution plus his pretax limit (19,500) and funded the remainder to his after tax 401k

Now, his new employer offers after tax as well. I know pre tax contribution cannot cross 19,500 but I read somewhere that doctors do after tax contributions to all their employer plans at 58,000 each plan with out crossing the pretax limit. Is this possible for people who are not doctors?

Slightly confused and would like some insight.

Can my husband (not a doc, just a simple Corp employee) contribute to after tax at new employer as well (keeping 19,500 pretax in tact) ?

Example below to explain myself better:

Employer 1:
Pretax 401k contribution =17,000
Employer contribution = 1,500 (could have been 2000 had he stayed up to year end)
After tax contribution = 36,500

jzh9v8,HastroX,"Why do people always say buy the smallest house in the best neighborhood?

For example in NJ, buying the smallest house in the best neighborhood usually means in a rich neighborhood. Basically in NJ at the same price points you can have a large mansion in the ghetto/lower income area, average house in the average place or a tiny house (or even just a townhouse/condo) in a rich neighborhood.

I understand buying a large mansion in the bad neighborhood isn't worth it due to crime, safety risks, no healthy food options, no infrastructure/ local government funding, bad schools etc. At the same time though buying in a rich neighborhood also has its flaws too. Essentially everything around you is at a premium. All expensive food shopping around you (4$ for an apple where in another area sell for 1$), expensive retails and even upcharged services you just because they think your rich. You also pay more property taxes (at least in NJ) due to the great schools. The smallest house probably may become so limited in aspects. I've seen kitchens with barely any space that they need a portable cart to put stuff on or rooms so small you can only fit one twin bed. Seems like the quality of life suffers base on these factors.

So I guess my question is, why do people not just buy the house in they income range they can afford?  From a logic perspective, I don't even begin to decide how much house I can afford without ensuring emergency fund, maxing my 401k and IRA first and even having extra savings to ensure when you buy a house it's not sparsely ""empty"" or filled with ""cheap"" stuff that you have to replace every year.

Thinking about all I have to do before buying a house makes me feel how much of a risk do people really tackle on? My parents former house owner brought a home and took out a 500K+ jumbo loan and an extra 60K+ loan somewhere and only downpaid barely 10% for their 3400 sq. mcmansion.

Our township  also surrounds a donut township that's even lower income but go to the same school as our town. The good news is more asians (indians in particular) are flowing to our township so the demographic might help the school scores in the future.

Here is the wording from the plan docs:

Company contributions:

Automatic pay credits:

After one year of total service, employees are eligible for automatic pay credits equal to 3% of Eligible Compensation (base salary/ regular pay and annual and non-annual cash incentives, capped at $100,000 annually). You don't need to take any action to receive the pay credits. Pay credits will be invested according to your investment elections on file for all future contributions to the Plan. Automatic pay credits are equal to 3% to 5% of Eligible Compensation (capped at $100,000 annually) based on years of pay credit service as of December 31 of the applicable plan year.

Matching contributions:

 (Company) matches your contributions, dollar for dollar, up to 5% of Eligible Compensation you contribute to the Plan once you complete one year of total service.

Remember you need to contribute 5% of your Eligible Compensation for the year to maximize the matching contribution (the company) provides.

t5wm4e,HeavySigh14,"Need some help figuring out what my next moves should be?

 Background: Hello, I am 22. I recently started a new job where I make 40k a year. I am a current Computer Science college student and I expect to graduate within 1 year. I also plan to do grad-school part-time after. 

For my immediate goals, I would like to start saving for a house (30k minimum), I want to start saving for Grad school, while also paying off all of my debt.

Breakdown:

**Take Home: $3,000 monthly (After Taxes)**

**Rent/Utilities**: $900 monthly

**Personal Bills**: $250 monthly

**Groceries**: $250

**Roth IRA**: $500 month/6k year (15%)

**Savings:** $265 month (750 total)

**529**: $40 monthly (I don't have kids yet, but I want one)

I don't have a car, but I would like to buy one soon (Insurance + Car payment = $500 month)

**Student Loans**: $6,000 total by the time I graduate (All subsidized) 

I'm eligible to participate in my job's 401k soon and have a match of 4%.

With my tax return, I also cleared out most of my credit card debt. I only have around $1500 left.

Anyway, I'm not sure what my next steps should be. I **desperately** want to own my own home within the next 3 years. My undergrad degree is free for the most part because of my scholarships and pell grants, but the Master's will cost me between $10,000 and $15,000. 

My current employer will not cover any cost of the Graduate degree, but it is likely that I will find a new employer anyway after I graduate soon.

I'm still relatively young and I have a bit of time, So I'm considering cutting my retirement down to only the 4% employer match and shoveling money into a saving's account for a home down payment. 

But, I also know saving for retirement is important, and starting earlier is better for compounding.        + my contributions won't even be vested with the employer match if I leave soon.

After I graduate, I do expect my income to go up to **at least** $50,000, and my master's should bring me to **at least** $70,000 yearly. (With a degree in Computer Science I suspect I can make a lot more). 

I'm not really sure what to prioritize right now. My Master's degree will increase my income and job opportunities. A house will start appreciating in value (especially if i get a fixer-upper. (My partner and his family are all licensed tradesman, so they'll do some of our work for cheap). Or, should I funnel money into my retirement so that I can FIRE, or retire early, and enjoy my life?

My mom want's to sell me her townhome below market value, but I'm not 100% sure if this is a good idea. She owns the home free and clear (No Mortgage) and has already brought a second house to live in

She wants to sell the home to me for between $225,000 to $250,000. This is A 3/2 townhome in the Tampa area. A comparable unit in her neighborhood just sold for $275,000, however my mother's house is on the water which may make her price go higher.

\- $1000 month for Rent/Utilities (My half)

\- $400-500 Miscellaneous/Fun 

\- I have no savings right now

\- I have $8500 in Federal student loans that are deferred until 2024. For a 10 year plan I pay $150/mon

\- Credit Score 680's

The rest is either used to pay-off debt or put in my Roth Ira.

I have been doing some research and the mortgage (assuming 250k) would run me $1900-ish a month, including HOA fees, property taxes (she would transfer her homestead exemption to me), Homeowners Insurance, and some utilities. Also, how does a gift of equity work? Would the home price be $300,000 and the equity gift be $50,000 bringing the price to 250k? The research online is a little confusing. 

The home has:

\- 3 year old new roof

\- 3 year old new HVAC system

\- 3 year old new appliances

\- 5 year old flooring

\- Recently had an inspection (less than 1 year ago) in which there were only minor problems

\- Would come partially furnished 

I currently live with my boyfriend of 3 years, I of course would not put him on the mortgage or anything official, but he would be my roommate and is willing to pay $1000 month for expenses/rent. I also have a friend who would be interested in renting one of the rooms out for $500. I could also rent the 3rd bedroom out for extra income, but I'm not sure on that yet.

My mother (who is a realtor) said she would pay $10,000 for my down payment and cover closing cost. She would also waive realtor fees, although I know we can go through an attorney instead to lower prices as well.

I'm really hung up on this decision. I know this is a great deal but the monthly payment is daunting. 

Although, I am a bit comforted that my income will increase after I graduate to at least $55,000.

Hey all. So a little context here first. 

My fiancÃ©e and I met in college. After college we moved away to get away from her physically and financially abusive mother. Her mother is awful with money and has a big â€œcredit cards are free moneyâ€ complex that keeps them poor. 

So her mom took out 160k of parent plus loans (in addition to the 25k in my fiancÃ©es name that weâ€™ve paid off) This was never discussed and my fiancÃ©e was just told â€œitâ€™s being taken care ofâ€. She was too lazy to fill out the FAFSA and instead took out loans for the entire balance. She then sprung it on us that weâ€™d be expected to pay 1/2 of the loans upon graduation. I believe the monthly payment as of now is around $1000. 

Weâ€™re saving for a house, so we cannot really afford to be throwing away that much each month. (Like wanting to buy one within the next year. Weâ€™ve been living with my parents to save for going on 3 years) My other concern is her mother is known for making dumb financial choices to pay for things she doesnâ€™t need. (Constant balance transfers. Multiple home equity loans). Iâ€™m concerned these loans were partially used to subsidize her spending and not fully used for school. Is there any way to confirm this ? 

The incomes we are working with are: 

Her Parents : About 60k a year 
Us: About 140k a year 

If it were up to me, Iâ€™d let them drown. It was their mistake and was never agreed to throughout school. However, my fiancÃ©e is worried that if we do that theyâ€™ll take it out on her sister who still lives with them. 

From what I can see, Parent Plus loans are eligible for IBR repayment plans which caps it at like 10% of discretionary income. Because itâ€™s based on their income and not ours, Iâ€™d assume the payment would be pretty low. Since their income is so much lower than ours, do you think this is the best plan going forward ?

Hello there. My girlfriend and I both graduated college last year and Iâ€™m coming up on a year at my first â€œrealâ€ job in January. We both live with my parents rent free and they told us we can stay as long as we like. Our goal is to use this time to pay down our student loans aggressively so we can eventually get married and buy a home. 

This is more about my budget. Gross I make about $3500 a month. My monthly budget looks like this: 

$500 - Car and Insurance 

$1000 - Student Loan Payment
 
$200 - Roth 

$300- Savings
 
$150 - â€œfunâ€ spending money
 
$70 - Gas 

$20 - Cellphone
 
$5 - Apple Music 

I try to keep my spending incredibly low so I can throw as much money at my loans as I can. Most months, I spend far less than my â€œspendâ€ allotment and just end up throwing it into my savings account. 

In terms of my assets I have: 

Around 10K in savings. 

Around 5k in checking. 

10k in my Roth 

15k in savings bonds. 

As soon as the 0% for federal loans expires, Iâ€™m going to make a lump sum payment on my loans for the entire 15k. 

I have about 60k worth of loans. They are federal and currently at the 0% rate. My girlfriend and I have the goal to have our loans cleaned up within 4 years so we can then start saving for a house. My parents said we can stay as long as we like. It really isnâ€™t bad since we have our own level of the house with a kitchen, bedroom, and bathroom. Is it bad to stay this long if they allow it? It feels like a great opportunity to pay off loans and save money. 

How does my budget look? My only weak spot I believe is my car and insurance. Iâ€™m 23 so insurance is very expensive. Public transit isnâ€™t an option for me so I need to drive to work. 

Granted, Iâ€™d love to improve my income. Iâ€™m not sure if 42k is considered â€œgoodâ€ for a first job out of college. Iâ€™m thinking about getting more schooling for free through my company. They will reimburse tuition in exchange for 2 year contract. Iâ€™m considering on getting an MBA part time since itâ€™s free. Does that sound like a good way to boost my income? I like the company so I have no issues with staying for a while. Iâ€™m lucky because I have an interest in finance / business and was able to find an entry level job in it even though my degree is Political Science (yeah I regret that a ton). 

I work for an OEM so the car was bought with employee discounts. The discount made it cheap enough where it will never be underwater. When Iâ€™m ready to move out, my plan is to sell it and dump any positive equity in my loans. 

Are there any other surefire ways to boost my income in the future?

mw3bff,helpdesk-26,"Asking for some guidance for my girlfriend after her mom messed up.

Hello everyone. Trying to make some long terms plans here but my girlfriend is in a bit of a pickle. So her mom was lazy and didnâ€™t fill out the FAFSA for college and instead took out most of her college tuition in parent plus loans. 

Yesterday she called us asking if we would take out loans in our name so she could pay off the plus loans. We refused. I guess the original agreement was for her and her parents to both pay about $600 a month towards them? In total there are about 140k worth of loans at anywhere from 6-7% interest. 

My girlfriend was sobbing last night after being told that number. Her mom never told her just how much the loans were and instead repeatedly told her â€œIâ€™m taking care of it donâ€™t worryâ€. She is now terrified that her life is ruined by this debt and that sheâ€™ll never be able to afford a house or to get married. She is livid with her mom and not speaking to her. I understand she has no actual responsibility for these loans, but sheâ€™s afraid of retribution towards her sister if she just cuts them off. 

She makes 55k as an RN. Last night, I did some quick math and it looks like if she picks up 2-3 extra shifts a month, thatâ€™ll give her about 1k extra a month to throw at these loans. Her only expenses are her car + insurance ($300 a month) and rent + utilities ($350 a month). Sheâ€™s contributing her full company match to her 403B and is contributing to a Roth. (Her mom said I was stupid for advocating for retirement savings). The rest has been going into savings while the loans are paused and a big payment will be made right before the interest starts again later this year. I believe she has about 20k in savings total. 

Realistically, how badly does this delay us from advancing in our lives? (We make about 100k-115k combined at 24)How quickly do you think we can get this debt taken care of? I know not to help her make payments if we arenâ€™t married.

1.	We currently live with my parents for free 
2.	Iâ€™ve accepted a new fully remote job that will allow me to work from anywhere 
3.	We are thinking we want to move back to a higher COL area (where we went to college)
4.	Combined we bring in about 130k a year 
5.	We have about 75k in total savings 
6.	She has significant student loan debt (60k or so) 
7.	I have much less student loan debt that Iâ€™m going to pay off as soon as deferment ends (25k) 
8.	Our only real expenses are our cars / gas / insurance which is about $800 a month 

Part of me is leaning toward renting just so we have some time to make sure we really want to live in the area and wonâ€™t move back a year later. We have visited extensively since leaving and have a good idea of the area weâ€™d like. I also am worried about the increasing cost of rent and like the idea of capping monthly payments with a mortgage. 

A townhouse / condo seems like it may not be a bad idea to buy. We have no plans of kids, donâ€™t need a ton of space, they tend to be in prime locations that we couldnâ€™t afford a stand alone home in, and theyâ€™re significantly cheaper. 

What do you think is our best move here?","Loss Aversion, Anchoring, Status Quo Bias, Present Bias","The individual is exhibiting Loss Aversion by worrying about the increasing cost of rent and preferring to cap monthly payments with a mortgage, indicating a fear of potential losses. Anchoring is present as they are considering a townhouse/condo as a potentially affordable option, which may not be objectively evaluated but rather influenced by the anchor of being cheaper than a standalone home. Status Quo Bias is evident in their current situation of living with parents for free, which might make them hesitant to change their housing situation. Present Bias is also observed as they prioritize short-term flexibility (renting to test the area) over long-term considerations, such as building equity through mortgage payments.","The individual tends to make conservative, short-term focused decisions influenced by a fear of loss and a preference for the current situation, which may lead to suboptimal long-term financial choices."

Hello. 26 year old engaged couple making about 130k combined in a HCOL area. 

We have about 80k combined student loan debt. Other than that, our only real monthly expenses are our cars and our 401k contributions. 

We currently live with my parents for free and have saved a pretty good amount up (75k). We lived together and paid rent in college, but arenâ€™t really sure renting is our best option as it seems mortgages may cost close to rent. 

I really have no idea how much house we can comfortably afford. (I see townhouses for about 300k-400k but am not really sure if thatâ€™s considered â€œin our budgetâ€.

Additionally, their current situation of living with parents for free may be creating a Status Quo Bias, where they are hesitant to change their current situation and prefer to maintain the status quo. Furthermore, their willingness to consider buying a house despite having significant student loan debt and uncertainty about their budget suggests a Present Bias, where they may be prioritizing short-term gains (e.g., owning a home) over long-term financial stability.","The couple's financial decision-making is influenced by biases that lead them to consider buying a house despite uncertain financial circumstances, prioritizing short-term goals and the status quo over long-term financial stability."

Hi all. I graduated with a pretty useless degree (Political Science) in 2019. I eventually found an intro level finance job making 40k a year. Last week I started my second job at 65k a year.

To start, Iâ€™m 32 and have a ways off. I am in the process of interviewing and am looking to change jobs, but there is some trickiness with my IRA and 401k. My current job pays biweekly, meaning two extra paychecks a year. I always used those paychecks to fill my Roth and trimmed my payments to hit the limit while the rest of my 20% went to my 401k.

Now I realizeâ€¦odds are, my next job wonâ€™t have that pay style and I am months behind. I threw a lot of spare cash in, it looked hopeless to match what my 20% goal. Those extra checks mean by year-round paychecks are lowerâ€¦and I canâ€™t afford to top off my accounts. Then I realized I could stretch my payments to April and have some breathing room. 

Now things are â€˜steadyâ€™ but there are some decisions to make if I jump right away, or am here until I get that extra paycheck. 

If I stick around a bit: The extra check is in June. I could drop it in my IRA solely to end the contributions at the calendar year for convenience, but thereâ€™s also no â€˜costâ€™ to doing my contributions May-April. 

If I jump soon: Iâ€™m in a good pattern to top off my IRA and hit my overall goal, a larger check means I get a couple hundred back and can budget normally again for myself. But that extra hundred has to be used next year for my IRA payments, and I shouldnâ€™t budget around it. Which means again, bump the payments back to January-December solely just because? Make my emergency fund eight months instead of six?

Meanwhileâ€¦whatever the 401k policy is, Iâ€™ll save up a while until I qualify and can do double payments once I qualify. And if they have an HSA, that has to get maxed with anything I can throw.

On one hand, they are inclined to pay off the loans aggressively, which suggests a desire to avoid the psychological pain associated with debt, indicative of Loss Aversion. On the other hand, they are hesitant to deplete their savings, as they have future goals such as buying a house, which implies a preference for immediate gratification and liquidity, characteristic of Present Bias.

I have been carrying $150k in student loan balance for the past 2 years while federal loans were frozen. When the freeze ended at the beginning of September, I paid off $76k of my balance. However, I'm still not seeing this reflected in my most recent Experian credit report that came out yesterday, it's still showing $150k in debt. The other credit bureaus have reflected the payment in their most recent reports, so what's going on with Experian?

eyt67k,Himalayan_Hillbilly,"Is becoming a doctor a good financial decision for me?

I know this may be a ridiculous seeming question, but let me know your thoughts. I'm a nearly 27yo guy, just got accepted to a DO medical school in Northern CA. Right now I'm the operations manager for a startup making $63k before taxes  Tuition at this school is $52k/yr. I'm assuming I can live off of about $20k-ish per year. This would bring my student debt at time of graduation to roughly $300k at something like 6% interest rate. If my residency is then 3-4 years, I won't be in a position to start paying down my debt until I'm about 35. Not sure what specialty I'll go into, but let's just be conservative and say I make $275k/yr. Does this make financial sense for me to do, or should I just remain in the workforce now and continue saving? I've been at my current job for about a year and am confident I can move to a bigger company with a higher salary in the near future. Any thoughts and advice would be great.","Anchoring, Present Bias, Status Quo Bias","The individual in this scenario appears to be exhibiting several biases. Firstly, they seem to be anchored to their current salary of $63k, as they mention being confident they can move to a bigger company with a higher salary in the near future, but do not provide a specific target salary. This anchoring to their current income may lead them to underestimate their potential future earnings as a doctor. Additionally, the individual displays present bias by prioritizing their current financial situation and near-term prospects over the potential long-term benefits of becoming a doctor. They also exhibit status quo bias by considering remaining in their current job and questioning whether becoming a doctor makes financial sense, implying a preference for maintaining their current situation.","The individual tends to make financial decisions based on short-term considerations and a reluctance to deviate from their current situation, leading to a potentially biased evaluation of the long-term financial implications of becoming a doctor."
ezdz3e,Himalayan_Hillbilly,"Trying to figure out the true cost of becoming a doctor. Can someone look over my spreadsheet and let me know if I'm calculating this correctly?

I am trying to determine what the true cost of going to medical school will be for me. Tuition is $52k/yr and I'll be taking out loans at a 6.8% interest rate that apparently doesn't compound until I start paying them off. With the cost of living included, I am assuming I'll be borrowing $75k/yrI am also trying to factor in the opportunity cost of lost wages. I am making the assumption that over the next few years if I remained in the workforce I could make $75k, then $80k, then $90k, and then $100k. Factoring this all together I'm coming up with a true cost of about $837,200 to become a doctor. Would anyone mind looking over my spreadsheet to see if I calculated this correctly? This sub isn't letting me post the spreadsheet so PM me and I'll send you a link to the Google Sheet. Thanks so much!","Anchoring, Status Quo Bias, Present Bias","The individual appears to be diligently calculating the true cost of becoming a doctor, which is a good practice. However, there are a few potential biases present. The person mentions specific dollar amounts for tuition ($52k/yr), living expenses ($75k/yr), and potential lost wages ($75k, $80k, $90k, and $100k), which may serve as anchors for their estimates. Additionally, by assuming these specific numbers without questioning them, they might be exhibiting anchoring bias. Furthermore, the individual seems to be focused on the immediate costs and lost wages, which could indicate present bias, prioritizing short-term considerations over long-term implications. Lastly, by seeking validation from others on their calculations and not considering alternative perspectives, they might be displaying a Status Quo Bias, sticking to their current plan and assumptions.","The individual exhibits a tendency to rely on specific estimates and initial assumptions, potentially influenced by anchoring, while prioritizing immediate costs and seeking validation, indicating Status Quo Bias and Present Bias."
