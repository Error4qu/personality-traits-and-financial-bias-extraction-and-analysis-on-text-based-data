Most of us old folks who are retired have 40-60% of our portfolio in Bond Mutual Funds and ETF's.  Typically much of their return is the monthly dividends.  With Treasury Bills near 1%, the dividend yields will eventually crash and hurt returns.  Right?

But as the stock market kept falling and it appeared our political and business leaders were failing us, more and more members of the club reported that they had sold most or all of their stock investments and went to bond funds.

So I am having some upcoming life changes, and was hoping I could get some advice on filling out the 2023 W4. My end goal would be to get as close to not owing, but also not having too much of a refund at the end of the years as possible. Although, it doesn't need to be perfect. I just do not want it weighed heavily one way or the other. 

I am currently married and file jointly. I am making \~130,000/year and my spouse makes \~75,000/year. We have 1 dependent. We have some changes coming up, and I plan to redo both of our W4s. 

Starting next week, my spouse will be starting a new job making \~230,000-250,000/year. My spouse is pregnant and will only be working at the new job for about 3-6 weeks before needed to take a 3 month leave. After 3 months, my spouse will return to work full time at the job with the above salary. Obviously this will also increase our dependents to ""2"" come 3-6 weeks from now. 

My question is, what would be the best way to fill out our W4s to get as close to my original goal as possible? I am pretty new to the new W4s and am a bit confused. I am also not sure how my spouse taking a 3 month leave should be taken into consideration when adjusting our W4s. Will this change the timing of when to submit new W4s, etc.?

I was looking for some advise/recommendations regarding personal financing with some major changes that are happening in my life. I currently average 130k a year. I have two dependents (young children in daycare-AKA second mortgage) and my spouse is currently making \~70k a year but starting in a week will be making \~230-250k a year. We currently invest into our 401/403b and have a decent emergency fund on the side (as much as we can invest with currently having the costs of daycare/dependents). With my spouses income increasing significantly, we are obviously looking deeper into how to invest our money moving forward. It is important to note we also have \~350K in combined student debt for which we are about 5 years into PSLF payments (fingers crossed in 5 more years the remainder will actually be forgiven and we won't get screwed with an even higher balance after accrued interest)

I was considering a financial advisor, but I have heard a lot of mixed opinions on whether it is worth it and I don't want to lose out on a lot of money long term. I also considered maybe seeing if a financial advisor could help screen over our situation and start a portfolio and then we take it from there for a flat fee (if this is a thing?). 

However, I am also interested in learning more about personal financing myself. I feel like I have a decent understanding of the basics. I know to max out pre-tax accounts like 401k/403b first. Also maxing out the HSA (especially since I have dependents) which can also be used as a mini retirement account later in life. I have heard mixed things on backdoor roth (seems like some ppl say its worth the hassle, others think it is a minimal benefit for the work you put into it/risk of messing something up with taxes).

However, when it comes to the more detailed stuff such as managing the stocks/bonds (what to put where) and then considering further investing of left over money in other index funds vs doing other things with the remaining money, this is where I feel less confident and don't want to make a detrimental mistake.

I guess my question is... is is worth working with a financial advisor with our current situation/incomes? Or should I be doing more research and trying to manage it myself? If the consensus is to manage it myself, does anyone have any advice on the better books/podcasts/videos that can get me started in starting to research this stuff?

Current situation: I make \~130k/year and my spouse was making \~80k/year. I believe we filled out the W4 by checking the 2(c) option on both of our W4s. We have both worked full time this year up until now. 

Upcoming situation: I will continue to make \~130k/year. However, my spouse started new employment earlier this week and will now be making \~220-250k/year (170k base and the rest with call pay, productivity bonuses, etc.).

2: Using the 2C option. However, I have heard mixed opinions on this. Is our income difference too much for this option? If so, what would it result in? Withholding too much from our paychecks?

We bought our house a few years back in early 2019. It was around 325k at the time with 4.375%.

We wanted a bigger house (we were renting) because we were having a baby at the time. We were able to get this house using a â€œdoctors loanâ€ knowing when my wife became an attending, income would significant change.

Itâ€™s now 2023 and we still owe 295k. I was just reviewing our personal finances as she just became an attending physician and our financial situation has obviously changed. However I am shocked after almost 5 years of ~$2,200 payments that we still owe 295k. 

I was looking at a mortgage statement form last month and it shows $500 towards principal, $1000 interest, ~$800 escrow. Seems crazy (although I understand without a down payment it will be higher). It just feels kind of defeating. 

So I guess I have a few questions with with our upcoming lifestyle changes taking place. 

1) From my research on this thread, I hear that typically you shouldnâ€™t focus on paying down mortgage as itâ€™s considered a low interest investment and money would be better focused elsewhere (such as maxing out 401ks, HSA, back door roths, etc). 

But with us having never put down a down payment, should we save up and try and put down 15-20% to lower the total loan some so we are not paying so much in interest? Or just focus our extra money elsewhere?

Spouse: Max out her 403b. Also set up and max out a backdoor roth for her. Her company also offers an additional 457 plan. ***Should we max out both her 403b AND 457 plan???***

15i47jj,CHB12312,"Retirement accounts priority/question

Currently married and our combined household income is ~360k/year. We do have ~300k in student loans (5 years into PSLF so hoping to have forgiven in 5 more years). 295k left of mortgage. We also have two children, one in daycare and another to soon be in daycare. 

My job offers a 401k. My spouses job offers a 403b and also has the option for a 457 (due to my spouses higher income). We also have an HSA account. We are also considering back door Roth accounts for the both of us. 

Ideally, I would like to max out my 401k ($22,500), my spouses 403b ($22,500), my spouses 457 (an additional $22,500), the HSA ($7500) and both of our back door roths (an additional $13,000).

However, my concern is that so much of our income would be towards retirement, and we would have less disposable income. I also worry that if for some reason the PSLF didnâ€™t work out, that all of that interest would accrue and all of our money would be tied up in retirement accounts and I wouldnâ€™t have enough to flat out pay off the loans. What do you guys think?

If I do decide to not max out every one of these options, what would be the priority of which ones we should max out first. Is doing the 457 with back door Roth overkill?

So my spouse changed employers and they offer both a TSA (403b) and an additional 457 (since she is a high income earner). My spouse just started in July but is also off for 3 months due to Maternity leave. We enrolled in the TSA but given that we wonâ€™t have a lot of extra income for the remainder of the year due to her time off, we deferred the 457. We were planning to enroll in the 457 come the new year (2024) when our financial situation is different. 

My question isâ€¦ are we able to enroll in the 457 plan at any time? Are you only able to enroll during â€œopen enrollment periodsâ€ like you are with benefits? If thatâ€™s the case, did I make a mistake by not just enrolling and contributing a very small amount and changing the contribution amount at the start of the new year? 

There isnâ€™t a possibility that since I deferred enrolling in the 457 during the start of employment that they could not allow up to enroll going forward is there?

15pm0a5,CHB12312,"Cobra Coverage Question

So my spouse and I were covered under her health insurance through her employer. She left her job 7/10/23 and I switched over to my employers health insurance plan. She elected to stay on her plan via Cobra for the month of July because she was pregnant and due to deliver in July. She stayed on Cobra because she was close to her out of pocket max and if she switched to my health insurance, it wouldnâ€™t have covered her delivering at the hospital she was planning to deliver. 

She ended up delivering at the end of July. From my understanding you can terminate Cobra coverage at any time (pay on a monthly basis). I had called my HR before any of this happened and explained our situation. I asked if she terminated her coverage starting August 1st, if that would be considered a â€œqualifying life eventâ€ to allow me to place her in my employers health insurance. They told me that yes it would be because she is losing health coverage. We sent an email last week asking to terminate her Cobra after July 31st. 

However, now I am doing further research, and many websites are saying that you can terminate cobra at any time, but this is NOT considered a â€œqualifying life eventâ€ and that you would not be able to be added to a spouses insurance plan unless it was during open enrollment or you had another qualifying event. This is NOT what my HR told me when I called. Is this true? If so, I have no idea what to do because we have now emailed Cobra asking to terminate and I am worried they are going to deny my attempt to get her on my health insurance and she is going to be left without health insurance until next open enrollment which would be terrible as she just had a baby and will likely need multiple follow ups. 

What do I do? Is it true that this will not qualify as a life event and that I am not going to be able to get her on my insurance? If so, what options do I have. Do we try and call Cobra back on Monday and ask them not to cancel the coverage and just get screwed with $600 monthly payments until my next enrollment period?

So our combined household income is ~360k. My spouse and I plan to max out both of our employers 403b accounts, max out our HSA, and max out a back door Roth for both of us.

My question is, what should we focus on next. Here are my thoughts:

1)  My spouses employer offers a 457b NON-governmental plan. This could be an additional $22,500 pre-tax dollars. However, I am concerned about it being non-governmental as we are young and it would probably be close to 25-30 years before we retire. That is a long time to have money in an account that we could potentially lose if things went south with the company. Realistically, it would probably never happen as it is a well known hospital with a current bond rating of AA, but you never knowâ€¦ a lot can change in 25-30 years. 

2) choosing a taxable brokerage account and start contributing to this post tax. We lose out on the pre-tax deductions, but at least I know it is safe and not subject to the employer staying in business

Mortgage: originally 330k, owe about 290k, monthly mortgage payment around $2,300

We have two children. One in daycare which is about $1,400/month and our other child is about to start so we will probably pay around $2,800 a month for daycare at least for the next year until the older child goes to school (so much money :( )

Other monthly costs such as utilities, food, gas, etc.

My car is paid off (worth about $15,000 currently)and my spouses car has about 30k left which comes out to ~$800 month.

No credit card debt

I have about $150,000 in student loans and she has about $225,000 in loans. We are currently pursuing PSLF and both work for qualifying employers and are both 5 years into it. We have paid almost nothing so far due to the COVID forbearance. Likely wonâ€™t have high payments for another year and half or two due to not needing to re certify income yet. So obviously the hope is that in 5 years we will have these loans forgiven for a fraction of the cost we pay.

We have a 401k with ~$90,000 and a 403b with ~$100,000

Between our savings/checking about $30,000

Obviously with her income increasing significantly, we plan to heavily focus on retirement investing.

With the remaining money I am considering placing into a HYSA until closer to the 5 year mark to make sure that PSLF actually works. That way if for sone reason it fell through, I could dump that money on it to help pay it off.

Mortgage: 290k (original 325k) at 4%. House is now worth 500k in current market

Student Loans: I have about 120k and my spouse has about 225k. We are currently pursuing PSLF. Both 5 years into it. Currently low monthly payments (<$10) because still using pre-covid income. This will change obviously. Our plan is to make the minimum payment on SAVE plan for another 5 years and hopefully have this forgiven

401k- $95,000 and a 403b with $100,000

HYSA $15,000; checking $12,000

Sadly with 2 children have to pay around $3200/month in daycare costs (hoping when the one starts going to kindergarten that the before/after day care will be cheaper?

Leftover pay after all our expenses each month: About $5,000-$6,000/month

**Our current plan:** Max the 401k, 403b, max backdoor roth for both of us, max HSA. My spouse also qualifies for a 457b which we are considering maxing as well. The largest stressors for me is the student loans. Obviously if PSLF works out, this will make a huge impact on our financial situation. However, I am a pessimistic, so I would like to be prepared in case for some reason it doesn't work out in 5 years. So my thought was taking the extra 5-6k we make each month and just dumping it into a HYSA so that way if at 5 years the PSLF doesn't work, I can use that amount to pay off the majority of student loans. If PSLF does work out, great I will invest/use that money to pay off any other debts at that time

This above plan may change some once we have to recertify incomes in the next 1-2 years as we will then likely have a decent sized student loan monthly payment (not sure how much this will be with out debt to income ratio).

How does our path to FI look so far? I often stress with the large amount of student debt and can't help but feel like FI is far off for us.

10cp4dg,ChiSouthSider43,"Financial Picture - ready to buy a new car?

I am trying to evaluate whether or not I'm ready to buy a new car. I know a car isn't a ""smart"" financial move; that's not what I'm trying to figure out here. More like do I need to have anything else in order before I make this purchase. 

My financial picture:

* 36 years old
* 6-month emergency fund
* $34k invested in 403b
* $20k saved for new car
* $10k in additional savings (outside of EF)
* Gross annual pay: $75,000
* Debt includes $82k mortgage balance and $129k in student loans (I know this number is astronomical. Mistakes were made in my early 20's. Interest has killed me because the original amount of these loans was only about half of this. Good news is I'm a teacher and this balance is about to be forgiven through PSLF. Just waiting on MOHELA to process my last form).
* No other debt
* I feel I'm a little behind in retirement savings, but I'm a single parent and for years I was trying to get on solid financial ground. It's just the last 2-3 years I've gotten on solid ground and been able to contribute a nice chunk to retirement. I'm also a teacher and in addition to the 403b, I will be eligible for a pretty good pension upon retirement.
* Take home pay after taxes, insurance, and 15% to 403b: $1900/paycheck
* I save an additional $400/paycheck to various sinking funds, so net after additional savings is $1,500/paycheck or $3,000/month
* Total monthly bills: $2,200. That's everything - mortgage, food, utilities, gas, car insurance, student loan payment, medication, subscriptions.

Car information:

* I want to buy a new SUV that costs $38k. I plan on doing a $20k down payment (I have been saving for about 5 years). I've been driving my current car for 10 years. It's not necessarily on its last leg, but repairs are starting to get more expensive (just dropped $1900 on it a few months ago).

The value on Form 8959 line 8 comes from Schedule SE line 6, and FreeTaxUSA brought it over just fine, but TurboTax doubled it, resulting in hundreds of dollars more in tax.

As I messed around trying to fix the problem, I eventually figured out that TurboTax has two versions of Schedule SE, which show up as ""Sch SE-T"" and ""Sch SE-S.""  I also figured out that TurboTax uses Sch SE-T for self-employment income that's attributed to the first-named person on a joint return and Sch SE-S for self-employment income attributed to the second-named person (I suspect the ""T"" stands for ""taxpayer"" and the ""S"" stands for ""spouse"").

Let me preface this by saying I assume I'm wrong / missing something, because everyone seems to know that bonds are an important part of one's portfolio (specifically, they help reduce volatility, and the closer you get to retirement, the more of your portfolio they should make up).  I keep wondering, though, don't bonds reduce volatility at the expense of returns?  Assuming that's right, what if you simply didn't care about volatility (you have nerves of steel or whatever) and had a flexible enough time-horizon that you could wait out any downturn or otherwise minimize sale of stocks that are down?  Bottom-line: Would an all-stock portfolio outperform a portfolio with bonds across the long term?

Even if we imagine a worst-case scenario in which a major downturn coincides with your retirement, wouldn't decades of maxed-out growth help your overall position (again, assuming that's what you'd get by being all in stocks)?  Sure, your portfolio would be down -- maybe way down -- but it'd be down from a higher high, right?  Also, it's not like you're going to liquidate your entire portfolio the day you retire -- you'd only sell enough for that week or month or whatever, so while it sucks to sell low, there'd be plenty other times when you'd get to sell at record highs (assuming a long enough retirement), and wouldn't continuing to max out growth be beneficial during retirement, as well?

I'm paid semi-monthly, and as a result of a payroll error, basically my entire mid-August paycheck went into my 401k.

I'm having a bit of a tough time picking what insurance we should get for next year. Some context: My wife will almost certainly max out any limit that she has. She regularly goes to Therapy, PT, and for the last few years she's unfortunately been in and our of the hospital for various things, all of which are out of her control. There's some injections/back issues that are in play for next year too. The rest of the family (me and the kid) are generally very healthy, and don't really go to the doctor that much, mostly just generic preventative type stuff. Obv could change, but that's been the history.

My options are:  
Traditional: $441/month (fam), $1k deductible (personal), $3k deductible (fam), 20% co-insurance for most services, $4k max OOP (personal), $12k max OOP (fam), co-pays are flat fees depending on the service

HDP: $310/month (fam), $2k deductible (personal), $4k deductible (fam), 20% co-insurance for more services, $6k max OOP (personal), $9.1k max OOP (fam), co-pays are 20% for all services, company kicks in $1,200 as a side benefit to the HPHD

The way that I'm thinking about this:

The wife will max out the OOP most likely regardless of the limit. The fam will likely not, but could obv. If the wife maxes her OOP, on the trad we're paying \~9k (440\*12+4000) + whatever the rest of the fam needs. On the HDHP we're paying \~9.7k ($310\*12+6000), less the $1.2k that work kicks in. Also less the tax benefit of the HSA which will max out (or approx $7k \* 25%) so -1.7k in taxes.

Also, if it happens that worst case the whole get super sick, the Traditional plan has 8k in extra OOP that we'd have to cover over the wife's limit, where as with the HDP there's only a max of 3k in extra costs we'd have to cover.

How would I figure out how much tax I actually paid on my business income when it's rolled into the total family income on my 1040 tax return?

Then at the end the of the year we file and do all of our normal stuff, inclusive of a Schedule C. But during the year, I'm also making money via my company and we pay taxes on that too. At the end of the year, we either get money back or owe them more money, some portion of that would apply to the business income/taxes part of the family.

But that 30% that I estimated would just be just that. An estimate. What is the real tax paid on my business income?

Assuming that it's at the effective tax rate that we paid on total income seems plausible, but means that credits/deductions the family got for the year would affect the estimated tax rate. This does however seem like the better of the two methods.

jfhijs,code-baby,"How much should I have invested in my ESPP as a % of my total retirement savings?

Hello everyone,

I've been reading a number of the threads here, and some really good advice, so thanks in advance!

&amp;#x200B;

My wife and I are blessed that we have a (relatively) decent amount of income we are able to put towards retirement savings each month given recent life/job changes, but now we are stuck trying to figure out where to invest the money.

I have an ESPP plan that we (almost) max out each pay period for $450/month (max $600/month), and 401k contributions are \~$1,500 per month (well past the max for the company match point, which nets us another +$600/month).  Thus far we have not sold any of the stock as we feel that the company is on a solid upward trajectory, we were trying to avoid short term capital gains taxes, and because the raw amount was not enough to spend much time thinking about.

Right now, we have \~$5k in company stock (mix of long term and short term at this point), and \~$75k in 401 savings (mostly large cap targeted retirement date funds through Fidelity if it matters).  The primary question is, when does the stock % become too high that I'm too tied to strongly to my companies results?  And/or should I sell some of it an invest it in something else?

Side question that I have (after reading this article [ESPP Contributions)](https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/8oso8o/how_much_should_i_contribute_to_my_employee_stock/), is should I be selling the stock right way and trying to reinvest it in something else?  I understand the relative value of selling it immediately, as I can capture the return on investment and put it somewhere else.  But that feels like it only nets me value if I can invest it into something that would have a higher return than the expected return of the company stock, is that correct?  The $$ profit realized on the stock is something that I would realize in the generalize long term regardless of when sold, so I think it would just be a question of which investment generates the highest likely return (company stock vs other investment)?

Final question, should I be maxxing out the ESPP for the remainder of the $150 per month?  One of the reason that we haven't thus far is for diversifications reasons, but related to my main question, that might not be something that I need to worry about and it might just be a fancy buzz word that misapplying.  The choice to max it out would probably involve putting less towards the 401k contributions, or not making extra payments on the mortgage as right now we're not strongly considering other life style changes to reduce expenses and save more.  (But we might in the future.)

And after typing this and re-reading, I guess one other thought is that we should consider selling the long term options and using those proceeds to max out the new stock purchases and capture a second round of discount/return.  Is that the right way to think about it?

&amp;#x200B;

Edited since I didn't say it specifically before:  I get a 15% discount on the ESPP purchases, and it's discounted from the 'lower of the purchase date or start of period'.

Evening,

I see much advice about having an emergency fund, and it being 3m to 6m worth of expenses, which makes sense for a single person, but how should I adjust that for a 2 income family?

The lady and I operate on the idea that it's very unlikely that both of us will lose our job at the same time (very different industries) and so we are taking the lower of our incomes, assuming that's 'fixed' and then calculating how much we'd need to survive with just that income for 6 months.  Is that reasonable method?

Our semi-committed expenses are \~$5,500 per month.  So our emergency fund is \~$10k.

pg7xsy,code-baby,"I feel like I'm making the right moves, but it's hard to see the long term and how I'll end up in retirement

See above for the cliffs.

(Much) Long version (sorry):

I'm 37, married, with 1 kid.  My wife (34) and I both went back to school later in life, and didn't really have any material income until we were \~34 and 31 respectively, so we were mostly starting at 0 till a few years ago (combined retirement savings of \~25k, combined student loan debt of \~80k, mortgage of 240k, CC debt of \~25k, and family debt of \~10k).

Now we're clearly in a much better place

* Combined income of \~200k per year
* 150k in various retirement accounts
   * 74k in my current company 401k
   * 22k in my previous company 401k
   * 12k in wife's Roth IRA from forever ago (Edward Jones, we're working to close and roll into the new vanguard account)
   * 12k in two new Roth accounts we just opened with Vanguard this year
   * 32k in my current company stock (partially RSUs vesting over 3 years), I max out my ESPP each period, which gives a 15% discount on cheaper of start or end of period price.  I'm willing to hear input on selling the non-RSUs, but honestly, I likely won't, I'm *very* bullish on the company, despite the 'too many eggs in 1 basket' risk
   * 5k in HSA funds
* Emergency fund of \~35k

We contribute 17% of my paycheck to my company's 401k (company kicks in another 6%) so that I max out the 19k yearly limit, plan to contribute 6k/year to each of our Roth IRAs in perpetuity, she is just now eligible for her company 401k, so we'll start contributing \~6% of her income to that (which maxes out the company match), and increase to the 20k limit over the next two or three years as incomes hopefully go up.

We also contribute \~5k total per year to HSAs at both of our companies.

The CC debt is gone (except revolving monthly spending for cash back rewards), the family debt is gone, student loans are down to 55k (and holding while interest is free) mortgage is down to 210k and we're paying it off on a 13 year timeline.

&amp;#x200B;

All of this 'feels' like I'm on the right track, but I find it really hard to get a sense of if we'll be ok in retirement at this rate or not.  Things that throw me for a loop:

* We're 'making' 200k right now, but in no way do we live like we do.
   * Given how much we put towards retirement (which we obviously wouldn't do in retirement)
   * We max out the DCFSA for our kid (thanks gubbament for the free money!) which we won't have in retirement
   * We're aggressively paying off the mortgage which we won't have in retirement
   * We have half baked plans to have another kid in another year or so, and then move into a new house \~2 years after that but rent our current house, and I've no idea how to think about how that will affect the long term plans

&amp;#x200B;

So it's really hard to know are we on track for a similar quality of life, something worse, something better?  If I just ignore the retirement savings, DCFSA, and mortgage, that's almost 50k a year in extra income that we don't 'need' to have the same quality of life.  So is it correct to assume that if we have retirement income of 150k, we'd be in \~the same boat?

Also I have no idea how to think about inflation.  A quick calculation on this site:

[https://smartasset.com/retirement/retirement-calculator](https://smartasset.com/retirement/retirement-calculator)

Suggests that 125k/year in income now may need to be \~225k/year to 'feel' the same.

&amp;#x200B;

And maybe as a more important question, what high level things would you recommend that we look into in order to better our situation?

The wife and I started using 1 joint card 3 or 4 years ago because it's easier and we like the rewards.

Recently a number of our cards have sent us letters saying they will close them due to inactivity. How much should we care about this?
We have no need of the actual credit limits as our primary card limit is vastly (10x) more than any normal monthly spend, but what sort of dent could this in theory put into my/our credit scores?
In my case, the joint card we use is also my longest existing (15+ years) so my length of credit likely isn't impacted.

Thanks!","Status Quo Bias, Present Bias","The user's statement reveals a tendency to maintain the current state of their credit card usage, as they mention that using one joint card ""is easier"" and they ""like the rewards."" This suggests a preference for the status quo, characteristic of Status Quo Bias.

w8kn4a,code-baby,"Buying iBonds with Emergency Fund

Another recent post here got me thinking:

Should I be using iBonds as a part of my emergency fund?

Pros:

Interest rate is vastly superior to what I'm getting in any sort of savings/HYSA

Cons:

Can't sell it for the first year

Will lose 3 months of interest if you sell before 5 years

Clearly it's just a question of risk management and trading liquidity for returns, but what % of your emergency fund would you consider 'reasonable' or 'safe' to have invested in iBonds?  We currently have \~6 months of typical spending saved in an emergency fund, and we're a 2 income household in different generally recession proof fields, so the odds that our income drops to 0 is almost non-existent.","Loss Aversion, Framing Effect, Recency Bias, Status Quo Bias","The statement reflects several biases. The consideration of using iBonds for an emergency fund, despite their liquidity constraints, suggests Loss Aversion, as the author prioritizes the higher interest rate over easy access to funds, possibly fearing losses in a traditional savings account. The framing of the decision as a simple ""trade-off"" between liquidity and returns indicates a Framing Effect, where the author presents the choice in a way that downplays potential drawbacks. The recent inspiration from another post implies Recency Bias, where the author's thoughts are influenced by a recent event or discussion. Additionally, the author's inclination to maintain their current financial setup, given their stable income situation, hints at Status Quo Bias, where they prefer not to deviate from their existing financial arrangement.","The user tends to exhibit a cautious and conservative approach to financial decision-making, often prioritizing potential returns over liquidity and being influenced by recent events and their current stable situation."
xf7ad9,code-baby,"Selling Company ESPP Stock, Sell Recent Stock or Older Stock

As the title implies, I don't know what the best bet is from a long term standpoint.

My newer stock (in the last year or two) has an average appreciation of \~30%, and would be taxed as short term capital gains on the profits. But my net cash in hand would be higher since gains are notable less (higher basis) and thus less taxes.

The older stock (older than 2 years) has an average appreciation of \~200%, but would be taxed at more favorable rates.

So it mostly comes down to a question of should I recognize the gain now and pay the taxes now or wait till later? One factor that I'm considering is that in future years we will likely go over the Roth ITA contribution limit, so we might better off selling now and recognizing the income so that if we sell in future years we don't price our self out of that option.

The goal here is to re-invest, so it's not specifically a cash flow question (i.e. not trying to go buy a car or house or anything).

xp454v,code-baby,"Parsing Store Receipts Easily to Subdivide Spend at Mega Stores

The wife and I are setting some new goals to travel more and do more fun stuff, while still living inside our means. One area that we think that we have a ton of opportunity is our 'grocery' spending. This generally includes anything that we'd buy at a grocery store including places like Wally World.

So from a practical standpoint, this would include actual groceries, beer, special foods (fancy cheeses, meats) health and beauty stuff (makeup, vitamins), baby stuff (food mostly) and household stuff (cleaners, bug spray, small kitchen stuff). Ideally we'd subdivide that into some other groups to have a better sense of where the money is going and where we have room to cut back.

**Do you currently** have any disorder, condition, or disease or are you currently taking prescription medication for any disorder, condition, or disease (other than: allergies; cold; or cough)? 

(i'm prescribed adderall- not for adhd but for an off-label purpose).

* Chest pain, heart disease or disorder, high blood pressure;
* Cancer, tumors;
* Respiratory disease or disorder of the lungs;
* Multiple sclerosis, epilepsy, seizure, stroke;
* Kidney, liver or pancreas disease or disorder;
* Diabetes;
* Mental or nervous disorder;
* Alcoholism, drug addiction;
* Chronic pain, rheumatoid arthritis, lupus; or
* Colitis, Crohn's disease, gastric bypass.  


(I went to a cardiologist over a year ago for mild intermittent chest pain I was getting. We did a stress test and an echocardiogram and both came back negative. My blood pressure also gets elevated while I'm working- probably from stress and drinking too much coffee since I work nights and also the adderall. It's normal when at rest and not stressed but I asked for a blood pressure medication anyway since most of the time I am stressed and running around.

Nationwide protests have cast a spotlight on racism and inequality in the United States. Now a major bank has put a price tag on how much the economy has lost as a result of discrimination against African Americans: $16 trillion.

Since 2000, U.S. gross domestic product lost that much as a result of discriminatory practices in a range of areas, including in education and access to business loans, according to [a new study](https://ir.citi.com/NvIUklHPilz14Hwd3oxqZBLMn1_XPqo5FrxsZD0x6hhil84ZxaxEuJUWmak51UHvYk75VKeHCMI%3D) by Citigroup. It's not an insignificant number: By comparison, [U.S. GDP](https://www.bea.gov/news/2020/gross-domestic-product-2nd-quarter-2020-second-estimate-corporate-profits-2nd-quarter) totaled $19.5 trillion last year.

And not acting to reverse discriminatory practices will continue to exact a cost. Citigroup estimates the economy would see a $5 trillion boost over the next five years if the U.S. were to tackle key areas of discrimination against African Americans.

""We believe we have a responsibility to address current events and to frame them with an economic lens in order to highlight the real costs of longstanding discrimination against minority groups, especially against Black people and particularly in the U.S.,"" wrote Raymond J. McGuire, a vice chairman at the bank and the chairman of its banking, capital markets and advisory team.

Wall Street itself has also faced accusations for years of discriminatory practices against African Americans, such as limiting approval for mortgages or not providing enough banking options in minority neighborhoods, which are among the damaging actions identified by Citigroup researchers.

Specifically, the study came up with $16 trillion in lost GDP by noting four key racial gaps between African Americans and whites:

* $13 trillion lost in potential business revenue because of discriminatory lending to African American entrepreneurs, with an estimated 6.1 million jobs not generated as a result
* $2.7 trillion in income lost because of disparities in wages suffered by African Americans
* $218 billion lost over the past two decades because of discrimination in providing housing credit
* And $90 billion to $113 billion in lifetime income lost from discrimination in accessing higher education

As a result, Citigroup urges a slew of actions to reverse discriminatory practices and boost GDP over the next five years, including addressing the wage gap suffered by African Americans and promoting diversity at the top within banks and companies.

He said yes, he was covered under the ER bill. I got the ER bill a month or so later and paid the $50 copay. I also received a check for around $2700 from my insurance company for seeing a provider that was out of network. Now about 6 months later I get a bill for around $33,000 from this plastic surgeon. I called my insurance company and told them the story about how the doctor he was in network.

The ER doc asked me if I wanted plastics to stitch up my nose. I'm 28 years old so of course I said yes as I didn't want horrible scarring. As soon as the plastic surgeon walked up to my stretcher, the first thing I said was ""are you in-network?"" ""I work here at the hospital and have the employee insurance"". He assured me he was and not to worry.

6 months later I get the $30,000 bill. Insurance cut me an out-of-network benefit check for \~$3,000 which I gave to the provider. Provider still wants the other \~$27,000. Someone showed me a link to this thing where you can sign and send copies to your insurance and provider and apparently, I guess it absolves you of responsibility? I already tried appealing insurance for more money, it was denied.

Pretty much what the title says and I guess this is more philosophical than a financial question but when we do eventually retire and itch closer and closer to death (think being around 70-80 something), should we keep money in our investments and the bank still at that point? I mean we retire because working becomes more annoying than the money is worth, otherwise we'd keep working all our lives. So my question is at what point in your life is the money still worthwhile to you and at what point does that turn and it's value depreciates in your mind. Now, I understand hoarding some in your old age if you have a family and needs to be tended to after death but I don't have any kids and the only person I plan on having to be cared for after my death would be pets (whom I would leave to my younger brother). Henceforth, wouldn't it make sense to at some point just cash out your remaining investments and have some fun with them? I know of course, this might sound dumb because you don't know when you'll actually die but assuming you keep easily enough to keep your housing, food, and medical bills in order for the rest of your life, then wouldn't throwing out the last remaining bits on people and experiences you enjoy make sense? I wouldn't necessarily spend it on materialistic items seeing as those will simply be gone when you die but the rest could leave a lasting impact or even help others. I just keep thinking about this because in Sweden, they do ""death cleaning"" when they're approaching their elderly age in which they throw away or give away materialistic items so their inheritors don't have to go through it all and determine what to do with it all. So, shouldn't or couldn't the same be applied to money?

I am starting a new job where I'll be getting a run of the mill windows laptop, I believe it's an HP Elitebook. I have the option to use it as a personal laptop as well. At my previous job, I was given a suped up M1 Macbook Pro since my job was very coding heavy, and was allowed to use it for personal use. I fell in love with the MacBook and its OS and haven't looked back.

I am starting in M.S. program in data science soon, run a side business online, and am also planning on doing various coding projects as well for my portfolio, as well as day to day personal use. Is it worth it to shell out $2.5k for a 16 inch M2 MacBook Pro? I would use the laptop until the day it dies, and all of my accessories are meant for apple products (keyboard, mouse, docking station). I'm also that guy and have an iphone, airpods, and apple watch, which are all synced to the Mac. Also size is very important to me since I don't have great eyes so I would shell out for a 16 inch.

I'm not trying to start a debate of windows vs mac. I'm simply curious if the price of the laptop is worth the use I'll be getting out of it? I'm a very frugal and money conscious person so I want to consider everything before I make a big purchase.

Thoughts?

Edit:

I thought I'd provide my finance info. New job will pay \~$150k TC, with a $100k base, 20% annual bonus, and rest is performance based bonus, $10k signing bonus and $8k relocation fee. I make roughly $25k from my side hustle although that may decrease with the new job and starting a grad program. Although I expect to use up the entire relocation fee. And I will also use up a good chunk of the $10k (around half) signing bonus post tax (it'll be about $7k post tax) by paying taxes this year and treating my parents to something nice finally.

Hi!

I (23) am a recent college graduate who wants to maximize my savings in long and short term, but am not very financially literate so I was hoping for some advice.

Background:

I recently started a job with a salary of 60K, and i am assuming that I will get raises and promotions in the future, along with a supplemental income. i put in 8% into my 401K and my company matches 3%. The max my company will match is 37.5% up to 8% of my compensation. How that works is if I were to contribute 8% of my compensation, my company will match 37.5% of that amount. Any additional contribution will not be matched. 37.5% of 8% is a 3% match. I know i should be putting in more than 8% but I am currently cash poor right now due to some personal emergencies. After taxes, 401K, health, etc. i bring home around $4500, including supplemental income. My expenses are roughly $1700/month. I will have a savings of about $14500 (after paying for all my emergencies) at the end of this month and have about $2000 in my 401k which I have not invested into anything (I would like to invest it but have no idea where to start). I have school debt of $21k of which i will start paying $200/month starting next month (unless you guys have a better suggestion.

z0kclp,CoookieHo,"HR is Not Telling Me Any Salary Info

UPDATE 2: I was very honest with my boss and he was very honest with me that my new salary is life changing and unfortunately there was no way he would be allowed to come close to my new salary. It was very amicable and understanding. That being said, I took the new job. I plan on keeping up my software skills and who knows, maybe I'll end up being back in software somehow. That being said, I'm super excited for the new job and all the new experiences it'll bring.

Update: Thank you all for your input! This blew up so much more than i thought it would. I haven't made a decision but I definitely have a lot more factors to keep in mind. One thing I forgot to mention is that this new job wouldn't start until Feb 2023 .

Update 2: I want to also clarify that this is a Technical Sales Engineering role, so while it does involve sales, it is sales-adjacent.

I (23 almost 24, one year out of college) work as a level 1 data engineer at a software company (1000+ employees) making $60k. I realized that I am underpaid for my position. Normally I'd leave immediately but I have a kickass manager who I would follow to the ends of the earth. I have also applied for other data engineering positions, but all interviewers said they were looking for experienced coders.

My boss has promised me that I will be promoted to level 2 in January, he was actually going to submit the paperwork this month but HR told him it was too late in the year to submit promotional paperwork...The issue is that he also doesn't know how much of a raise I will receive when I am promoted because HR is keeping finances hidden from him as well. Every attempt I have made to get HR to give me an inkling of financial expectations has lead nowhere. This frustration led me to apply for a Technical Sales Engineering job, which I surprisingly got. Money wise, I would be paid 2.5 times my current engineering salary (new salary would be 150k). The issue is that the job would take me out of the software game since it's an electronics company. I want to give my current company a fair shot solely because of my boss and I also want to stay in software, so any advice on how to get HR to tell me what my salary expectations will be? That way I can counter and see what I can get from my promotion before I have to give the job offer an answer by its deadline.

riy9fk,CraftCanary,"Is a 401k employer match based on your yearly salary or the actual amount you were paid from when becoming eligible to start the 401k?

Edit: math checks out, it looks like they match per pay period (every other week for me)-

Original post:

My employer matches 25% of the first 6% and I make ~120k a year.

I set my contributions super high to try to offset this (like 40% of my income) and get a decent amount contributed for 2021. I have contributed 12k at this point, well over 6% of my yearly salary.

Shouldnâ€™t my employer match be ~$1800 now? Because currently it says only $418.

if2nw7,CuriousernCurioser,"How to choose a financial advisor/planner.

If you want to do it yourself thatâ€™s fine. If youâ€™d prefer to hire a professional these are the 3 questions to ask. 

1) Are you a CFP? 

CFPs are the cream of the crop in the industry. They go through more extensive education and training and have experience requirements that donâ€™t exist for your average advisor. 

2) Do you charge fees or commissions?

You want to eliminate the conflicts of interest between you and your planner as best as possible. Commissions for trades are the worst compensation structure because they are getting paid regardless of the advice they give. Flat monthly fees are best because the advisor is now being compensated for the advice they give and not just the investments. Fee based and and Fee for assets model are the most common and fine as long as the advisor is worth the advice they are giving. Many of the best planners charge a fee for assets under management because itâ€™s the most lucrative business model and they have no trouble keeping and acquiring happy clients. 

3) What if I wanted to buy a stock?

You donâ€™t want an old school stock picking broker who hasnâ€™t kept up with the times. The evidence is clear that index funds are better than most mutual funds and picking stocks. The advisor should reply with some form of, â€œyou can do whatever youâ€™d like with your money, but if we are going to work together I do whatâ€™s been proven to maximize your chances of success in the long term, and that means I donâ€™t pick stocks and I donâ€™t try and time the marketsâ€. This may seem harsh but if they are willing to let you do it then they have one foot in the old school and a good sign theyâ€™re not truly objective. 

* if you find yourself in some niche like government employee, doctor, dentist, retiree, employee stock options, and can find yourself a specialist who only works with these people and wonâ€™t take on others, this is ideal. Specialists are more valuable in finance for the same reason you want someone who does hips all day to replace yours as opposed to a general orthopedist.

My wife 38F) and I (33M) have been saving up for a down payment in SoCal (LA county). We currently have about 95K saved, and my original goal was to save 140K. I am planning on putting down 10% (assuming no more than a 600k home), having between 10-15k for immediate repairs, and another 15K for closing costs. Then with the remaining 50k make a principal payment to reduce the size of the loan. 

Question: With the extra 50k saved, should I apply a principle payment, or put it in my brokerage account (fskax) and let it grow, thus giving me options with the money in about 20 years or so (I.e pay off home sooner, FIRE, etc)

Extra details:
We gross 132K right now, will go up to 135 starting July 1. We have no debt, 8 months of EF savings, investing 24% of gross income towards retirement between 2 pensions, 2 Roth IRAs and my 403B. Brokerage account has $5 (just opened last week). Planning for a child but will likely need medical help. Have sinking funds for various upcoming expenses.

Hey everyone, my wife and I are hoping to start a family later this year. I wanted to get ahead of the game and open a 529 for our (hopefully) future child.

14gztjf,DarkTyphlosion1,"Thoughts on a 3 tiered emergency fund?

Hey everyone, happy Friday. Iâ€™ve been thinking about this for a couple of weeks now and hoping to get a discussion going about this idea I have,  partially inspired by The Money Guy show. Iâ€™m not risk adverse, but more along the lines of covering my bases â€œjust in caseâ€. 

First tier is the emergency fund (9 months) which is strictly an â€œincome replacement fundâ€ if either my wife or I lost our jobs. 2 months is in a separate bank, the rest in a HYSA. 

Second tier is having our deductibles saved up (renters, car, and earthquake, total is about 6K), currently in I Bonds but can be redeemed at any time (bought in November 2021). 

Third tier is having our max out of pocket medical expenses saved (3K for both) in the same HYSA, but different bucket. 

The emergency fund is 9 months bc weâ€™re hoping to buy a home in 2025 or 2026 and have been trying to start a family, so I know instead of being 9 months it will probably go down to 3-4 months depending on how much our expenses rise.

\-If I can open an HSA through Fidelity, would I invest the money as I do with the Roth (i.e. Target Date Funds)?

\-Did having to pay state taxes for contributions and earnings (and potential capital gains) cause you to not choose an HSA if offered?

For example, will Wells Fargo and Chase allow accounts to be converted from individual/joint accounts to trust accounts WITHOUT a change in account numbers?  The trust's schedule of property already references the existing account numbers so it would be nice to preserve those.

Also, same question for non-retirement investments (i.e. non-IRA) at Vanguard.

zlfjhm,desertsnakes,"Lawyer and Insurance Agent don't agree on beneficiaries

We had a revocable trust completed and got a set of funding instructions from our attorney.  

For average people like us, her advice was to name the Trust as the Primary Beneficiary, and Spouse, Children or other Heirs as Contingent beneficiaries for Life Insurance purposes.  We have minor children too young to be viable beneficiaries anytime soon.  The trust would govern what happens to the money if my wife and I both died.

Fast forward to now.  We're trying to take out term life insurance policies.  Our insurance agent thinks it's a bad idea to even list the Trust as a beneficiary at all.

A number of years ago I inherited some cash and combined it with my savings to deposit into a new  Vanguard account.  It's a mixture of VTSAX and VTIAX and maybe 10% bonds.  The total balance has grown in value to about $300K.  

These funds are in non-retirement accounts, but are  being invested just like retirement funds because I did a poor job of saving for retirement in my 20's.

17cc118,DexterTwerp,"HSA Max Contribution Calculation

I'm looking to max out my HSA for 2023. There are quite a few factors at play. I had two different HSAs with different companies. 

First, I had a HDHP from 5/31/2023 to 9/1/2023. My total contributions during this time was $1,282.40. I was on the individual plan. 

Then, now I have a HDHP starting 10/1/2023. This time on the family plan so my max contribution goes up to $7,750. There are 4 remaining pay periods for 2023 (I get paid on the 7th and the 22nd). Is this how it works or can I contribute up until tax day of 2024? 

I believe the IRS considers you eligible for the entire month as long as you were covered on the first day of the month. Prorated max contribution considered... So I had 4 months of eligibility on the first HDHP and 3 months remaining of eligibility for the second HDHP. My total max contribution for this year is $4,520.83 minus what I already contributed $1,282.40 = $3,238.43 divided by number of paychecks left (4).

I was just recently promoted. Iâ€™m exceling in my career field and will definitely have an income boost within two years again. After the new year, Iâ€™m also getting a merit increase which was 18% last year, but I canâ€™t expect that high this year because it was an outlier. My plan is to buy a nicer house and then rent it out to my significant other as well as another tenant. Even though Iâ€™m going to rent it to close family members and friends, I still would like to do it professionally and have them provide security deposits as well as sign leases.

I also have a side gig that generates an additional $200 each month. This is not included in my income shown above. My S/O income will increase eventually as sheâ€™s switching jobs soon. 

Iâ€™m going through the Bank of America first-time homebuyer program that pays $7,500 in closing costs and 3% of the down payment ($15,000 covered by them if my home was $300,000, nothing additional is required). I was approved for $300k and Iâ€™m going to be looking at houses soon. I believe my interest rate is 5.25% with 5.451% APR, but these are subject to change. My monthly debts are $336 for my $14k car payment, but the car is worth $20k at the very least so Iâ€™m not under water. Itâ€™s also a 2019 with very low miles so itâ€™ll last awhile hopefully. I have 3.5 years left on the loan. 

Given these factors, how much house should I comfortably target for?

wpkqs2,DexterTwerp,"Is my house hacking strategy good?

I hopefully will be house hacking starting in 2023. Please analyze my strategy and let me know if you see any flaws or risks.

**Financials**

*All the calculations are based on a $2,000 mortgage.*

Income:

Gross: $67,800 yearly $5,688 monthly $2,844 bi-weekly

Net: $52,338 yearly $4,362 monthly $2,180 bi-weekly

Projected rental income (found tenant, ready to sign lease): $10,800 yearly $900 monthly

Current debt-to-income ratio (w/ mortgage included): 41%

Current debt-to-income ratio (w/ mortgage &amp; rental income included): 36%

Emergency fund (cash reserves only, not including payment for closing costs &amp; down payment): \~$12,000

% of net income spent on housing: 46

% of gross spent on housing: 35

% of net spent on housingÂ (w/ rental income): 40

% of gross spent on housingÂ (w/rental income): 31

**Rules of Thumb**

*No more than 30% of your gross monthly income should be spent on housing:*

A $2,000 mortgage puts me at 35%, but with the rental income itâ€™s 31%.

*Your mortgage payment shouldn't put you more than 36% DTI:*

A $2,000 mortgage puts me at 41% DTI, but with rental income itâ€™s 36%.

*The 4x rule (if you spend less than 20% of your current take-home income on debt):*

I currently spend less than 5% of my income on existing debts, so the 4x rule gives me a purchase price of \~$270,000 with no HOA dues. This is currently the price target Iâ€™m aiming for. So although these calculations are based on a $2,000 mortgage from a \~$300,000 purchase price, it will more likely be a $1,800-$1,900 mortgage.

*Emergency fund for household expenses to last at least 6 months:*

Stashing away $2,500 for 6 months puts me at $15,000, but by the time I officially close and have to start paying the loan I should be around there.

**Factors to consider:**

* My girlfriend will live with me, and her income was left out of the loan approval process purposefully to ensure we do not overextend ourselves. My current thoughts are that weâ€™ll just split the mortgage from whatâ€™s left over from the other tenant. Weâ€™ll be paying around $550 each with the current calculations.
* I would need to lose my job and BOTH of my roommates in order for me to be truly swamped. In this case, I could sell my \~$20,000 car and live off my current cash reserves to give me time to find another job or sell the house.
* I shouldn't rely on this but my quoted \~5% interest rate leaves room for improvement, so I could refinance down the line and save money.
* The tenant is only signing a lease for a year, so the rental income is not guaranteed for the life of the loan but hopefully my income will increase in 2 or 3 years to a point where I can cover their portion eventually or find another tenant. 

Are there any flaws in this way of thinking? Any other rules of thumb I should use?Â 

Thanks for all your help in navigating this!","Confirmation Bias, Anchoring, Status Quo Bias, Recency Bias","The individual presents a comprehensive analysis of their house hacking strategy, focusing on financial metrics and rules of thumb. However, upon closer inspection, it appears that they are selectively presenting information to confirm their preconceived notions. For instance, they emphasize that their debt-to-income ratio will be 36% with rental income included, which meets the rule of thumb, while downplaying the 41% ratio without rental income. Additionally, they anchor on a specific purchase price of ~$270,000 based on the 4x rule, without considering alternative scenarios. Furthermore, their reliance on a single tenant's income and their girlfriend's contribution to expenses suggests a status quo bias, as they seem to assume that their current situation will persist. Lastly, their optimism about future income growth and potential refinancing opportunities may indicate a recency bias, where they are overemphasizing recent positive trends.","The user exhibits a tendency to selectively seek confirmation for their house hacking strategy, while anchoring on specific numbers and assuming a status quo, with a possible overemphasis on recent positive trends."
yozif4,DexterTwerp,"Job negotiating... Should I accept this new offer?

Here's the rundown.

My current job is with a very solid company. I am fully remote. They offer a retirement benefit of 10% (no match required, fully vested instantly), we work 7.5 hour workdays, admin staff is talking about adding amazing flexibilities like random 'wellness' days, I love my team, and I am very independent which I like, very flexible work schedules, 30 total days of leave (sick, vacation, and bereavement). My salary is currently around $68,000, but we do market research every year to make sure we are keeping up with inflation. Last year it was an 18% increase. That was for being within the top 60% of our industry. This year we are doing top 70% of the industry, but I do not expect it to be as high as 18%. I expect the 5-10% range starting Jan. 1st. I also recently got promoted, so I wouldn't be eligible for another raise for at least another two years.

The new job just offered me $80,000. They have a Cash Balance Retirement account where the company contributes 4 percent of your annual pay and bonus but this doesn't vest until 3 years of service. For the 401k, they match â€œdollar for dollarâ€ up to the first 3 percent you contribute. They then match 50 cents on the dollar for the next 2 percent. You are immediately vested and are free to take the company match with you if you decide to leave the company (no waiting period). Four and a half weeks of leave plus 5 days of bereavement. It would be a hybrid model (I could probably negotiate a remote role) coming into the office once in awhile on Mondays. I live 5 mins from the office. They give a $50 stipend every month for Internet, gym membership, or anything that I could use. There's probably more benefits but those are the most important ones to me.

They seem THRILLED to have me. What should my negotiation tactic be? They realize I am content in my current role. I have another offer on the line and they know it. I am not accepting that offer, but it's good they feel a little threatened. Should I shoot for the stars and have them meet in the middle? What's the plan here?","Status Quo Bias, Anchoring, Present Bias","The user's statement reveals several biases. Firstly, the Status Quo Bias is evident as the user seems to be heavily influenced by their current job's benefits and flexibility, indicating a preference to maintain their current situation rather than making a change. The user mentions loving their team, being very independent, and enjoying the flexible work schedules, which suggests that they are attached to their current job and may be hesitant to give up these benefits. Additionally, Anchoring is present as the user is comparing the new job offer to their current salary ($68,000) and benefits, rather than evaluating the new offer on its own merits. The user also mentions expecting a 5-10% raise in their current job, which may serve as an anchor for their negotiation expectations. Lastly, Present Bias is apparent as the user is focused on the immediate benefits and flexibility of their current job, rather than considering the long-term implications of staying or switching jobs.","The user exhibits a bias towards maintaining their current situation, with a tendency to anchor on their current salary and benefits, and prioritize short-term gains over long-term considerations."

Currently live in Central MA with my parents (cheap rent), looking at Pittsburgh PA area. I would like to payoff my student loans ($60k), get a small starter home (\~$250k), and possibly a new car ($40k) in 1-3 years. This just isn't possible in my area, but is more feasible in a LCOL area. My thoughts are if I hate it there I can move back to my home state and rent out my home in Pittsburgh. This would be 9 hours away. Renting is an option but more difficult with my dog (Belgian Malinois).

&#x200B;

I am 25 single with a dog. I make $95k, expecting a $10k raise and $10k bonus this year. By the time I move in 1 year, I'll have 25k left in loans and 25k for a down payment (in addition to emergency fund). I also max 401k. I've worked at this job for 1 year, it is all remote with clients across the US.

Average starter home in my area \~$450k, or rent nice 1bed \~$2000.

Average starter home in Pittsburgh area \~$250k or rent nice 1bed \~$1500.

&#x200B;

I know the best financial plan would be to wait and save more, but I really want to get out there on my own and start making a life for myself. Absolutely not staying at home any longer than 1 year. I feel like the only realistic way to make my goals happen is moving to a lower cost of living area.

I was in a rehab facility January and February last year after surgery.  I would say every other person in the facility was medicaid/medicare.  More on that in a second.

Thanksgiving week I received a bill that the facility hand wrote my forward to address on from a pharmacy out of state.  It was literally an invoice with my name on it, a due date back in August, and a bottom line amount due for a few hundred dollars.  Not a single indication of what the bill was for, when, etc.  I called the 800 number and they told me they would reprint the bill and send it to me.  I gave them my correct address.  The week after Christmas, I got another hand written forward of the exact same bill.  No changes, no updates, except the bill now said 'past due'.

The Monday after New Years, I received another letter, to the correct address from a collection agency saying I had a bill that was being collected on because I failed to pay it in August.  The only associated number was the same one I called before.  They tell you to press '6', then '1', etc, and you get a prompt that indicates you want to pay a on a collection notice.  Since it's the same number, and they have a menu prompt, this can't be an uncommon thing for them.

I got through to a representative, and explained they had been sending bills to the wrong place, I wasn't getting those bills, and when I did, there is no information in the bill as to what it was for.  The rep said they saw I had called to get a reprint, but that I refused to pay the bill.  I asked them if they could send me the actual invoice that i was supposedly missing, and they told me it looked like it was for 2 bills, one back in December of '21 for a partial Medicare copay.  I explained to them I am not on medicare (I still work and have private insurance), and I wasn't in the facility in December.

I asked them to send me an updated invoice to my email, that I think they have some mistakes on the bill, and to ask the collection agency to back down.  I also asked for a reference number for the call so when I called back i would have a case already opened.  She said I just needed to use my 'account id'.

I want to get it into something that is not super easy to just move money out of (a few days is fine), but doesn't lock my money up for years at a time.

Recently been given a medical diagnosis that might leave me unemployed and disabled in 2-3 years. I wont need intensive care, bur without getting into details I wonâ€™t be able to do many job functions (so still could find a job of some kindâ€¦ but not counting on it).

Wife and I (both age 31) a combined income of 200k (120k for me 80k for her) my wife will be at 100k in a few years, so that could be the sole income.  But if I am unable to work at age 32-33 I need to have a good system set up of security.

We have been very financially smart,  but worried about me not being able to bring money in here soon. Here is our set up.


* to start our full net worth is around 730 which is in:
* 25k Savings (was for new house and emergency fund)
* 22K I bonds (was for newhouse and emergency fund)
* 6K HSA
* 100K non retirement brokerage
* 106k roth (with 66K I could technically pull of contributions)
* 50K in 401K
*We have a house that is valued at 400k and we have 3 years to pay it off 
(at 3k a month. we are going 1k over our mortgage but once I got my medical issues I wanted this as a peace of mindâ€¦ sort of so we wouldnâ€™t have to worry about our largest expense. I know this is against popular logic but this is important to meâ€¦ to be able to feel like I took care of the biggest expense while I had my job and health)


**So my real question isâ€¦ where should I be putting any extra money? Through out the next few years ill have 1-1.5K a month potentially I could put in places like Roth, HSA, and non tax brokerage account.**

 I am confident in my wifeâ€™s role so we will have income coming in (100k) and we will have our house paid off right around the time I wonâ€™t be able to workâ€¦. But if I am maxing out my roth (6k), HAS (3.5k) and 401K (30.5k after company match a year) for another 2 years, that still puts us in a great position. 

I realize while not idealâ€¦I have near 160ishK of accessible money for some horrible double loss of employment or something. That includes roth and some avenues not ideal for early use. 

But outside of keep on keeping on this pathâ€¦ what should I be doing with extra money I want to be accessible once I get out of work, the non-retirement brokerage? Bonds? High yield savings account? Any advice welcomed.

**Alsoâ€¦. The last year with my medical diagnosis has left me depressed and suicidalâ€¦ seeing a therapist has literally saved my life and gave me a positive outlook. I encourage anyone to do so if struggling.**

**I fully realize that outside of my health I am blessed with an amazing wife who is gonna help me out as well as a very strong financial start to everything. So i hope the numbers dont come off as a humble brag**

EDIT:I also wanted to add.... my biggest regret is not doing disability insurance.

ohmrj0,dipcupdipcup,"Plan to aggressively pay off condo (2.3 years), save for downpayment on house (need 50K more), and modestly invest (6K a year Roth)

Recently married in the US, and we have a net worth of $292k (see break down). We are both 29 years old. We have a small combined monthly income (7.2k) and make a combined 80k after taxes. Both of our jobs don't really offer any retirement account or benefits, so we just fund a roth yearly ourselves.

Due to a generous gift as well as a unique family situation, we are planning to pay off the condo we live in, in 2.3 years. This needs to be done time wise for a family situation far too complicated to explain. To do this, we are paying 4K a month (for the next 2.3 years). The idea is to pay it off in the 2.3 years, any leftover money save up for a down payment for a new house (try to get about 100k, so we are halfway there with 50k savings), and then because of that aggressive strategy, just barely fund our roths (6K each). If we aren't able to save another 50K, after we pay off the condo, we will aggressively save for another year or two since we will own the condo and no mortgage payments. 

The grand idea... is rent out the condo (for 1.5-2k a month) and then use that to pay most of the monthly mortgage on a large house (20-30 year mortgage). Thus, since that is paying off most of the mortgage, our salaries will feel much larger than they are (used for investments, savings, set). 

The downside of this plan, is that we are neglecting our retirement accounts a bit for the next few years, as we might have to dip into savings/the down payment fund to get that 6k a year each. We kinda decide paying off the house and viewing that as our investment for the next few years is our goal.

I wanted to run this plan by here to see peoples thoughts. We have to pay the condo this way. Is focusing on this and the downpayment better then investing for a few years? Should we hold off on the downpayment and make the Roth a priority for the 2-3 years? Funding the roth for 2-3 years is 24-36K that could be for the downpayment. Or is it best to save and do roth and once the condo is payed then aggressively save.

Currently Iâ€™m (22M) sitting comfortably in a corporate finance type job at a Fortune 500 company. Making $70k a year at my age so really canâ€™t complain. I could climb the corporate ladder and build a good career for myself here, or at least get some experience for a couple years and see what opportunity comes next.

Looking for feedback on where some of you draw the line between saving for retirement and general saving for life before then, like a down payment for a home. Do you have a method for deciding on that amount? Iâ€™ve read many here say that if you canâ€™t max out your retirement accounts (401k+IRA), you canâ€™t afford to buy a house, but that seems a little harsh.

jvjkor,disgruntIed_giraffe,"Is Roth worth it in high tax states?

I really like the idea of Roth since I know exactly how much I have and donâ€™t need to worry about tax rates come withdrawal time, but I donâ€™t want to let personal preference get in the way of the better financial decision, especially since my marginal tax rate is so high. I (22M) live in CA and am making ~70k/yr which puts me at a 31.3% marginal tax rate: 22% federal + 9.3% CA (though only a ~21% effective tax rate). 

Iâ€™m unsure whether I should choose traditional or Roth for my 401(k). I figure a pro for Roth is that Iâ€™m starting young and plan to contribute ~20% to retirement annually, which should give me a higher retirement income on distributions alone, plus I expect the U.S. to have higher taxes in the future. However, saving 31.3% on taxes right now is a big pro for traditional, and if I end up retiring in a low tax state then it would almost certainly have been the move.

One option Iâ€™m considering is starting out with Roth then jumping to traditional when I start earning more. I expect to be promoted and making $85k/yr in 3 years, so I could do 3 years of Roth 401k contributions then traditional indefinitely after the pay jump.

kczrha,disgruntIed_giraffe,"Basic Investing Advice to get you started.

I wrote this out for a friend, thought it might be helpful to share here too. The goal is to provide some context for beginners and show how to get started. Iâ€™m open to questions from anyone trying to learn, or critiques from the veterans.

First off the rule of thumb is to only have your emergency fund and expected upcoming expenses in cash, everything else should be invested. Think about how much cash you need, and in the meantime you can start small by investing a little bit each month and increasing your contributions as you get more comfortable. For how you should be investing, Iâ€™m going to recommend putting everything into a Total Stock Market Index Fund.
 
A Total Market Index Fund tracks the performance of the entire US stock market. The way it works is it has almost 3,700 different stocks in it, each weighted based on their total value in the stock market. For example Apple is the biggest company in the US by market value, worth 6.5% of the entire stock market. Microsoft is the next biggest at 5%. So if you have $100,000 invested in a Total Market Index Fund, itâ€™s like you actually have $6,500 invested in Apple, $5,000 in Microsoft, and so on based on each of the 3,700 stocks weighted values.
 
The S&amp;P 500 is another popular index fund. It is comprised of the 500 biggest companies in the US and makes up over 2/3 of the total stock market, so it has a lot of overlap with the Total Stock Market Index Fund, but it has a little less exposure since it excludes the smaller companies. Historically the performances of these two indexes have been nearly identical.
 
The S&amp;P 500 and Total Stock Market have had over 13% annual growth over the last 10 years, so in that timeframe $100,000 invested wouldâ€™ve grown to ~$370,000, which is a great example of how powerful investing is over sitting on cash, but itâ€™s also important to note that past performance does not guarantee future performance. These last 10 years have had particularly strong growth, and Iâ€™d be surprised if it keeps that pace.
 
The Total Stock Market fund and S&amp;P 500 fund are both synonymous with â€œthe Market,â€ and are two examples of low-cost, passively invested index funds. Index funds seek market average returns, but there are thousands of actively managed mutual funds to choose from which are more expensive and exist on the belief that theyâ€™ll â€œbeat the Market.â€ Some do, but in reality most end up underperforming, which is why Iâ€™m recommending a cheap and easy index fund.
 
You can find these funds at any of the big investment firms: choose from either Fidelity, Vanguard, or Charles Schwab. To use Fidelityâ€™s Total Stock Market Index Fund, FSKAX, thereâ€™s no minimum investment, and the fee is only 0.015%, so every $1,000 you have invested will cost you 15 cents each year. Good practice for investing is to consistently contribute every month, as much as you can afford. You can do things like set up direct deposit to have a portion of your paycheck go straight to your investments, or automatically transfer some amount from your bank like $500 every month, or just contribute each month based on how much you have available. They have good customer service that will help you get setup.  
 
Note on the power of compounding interest: Historically the market has averaged 10% annual returns. At that rate of growth, if you were to invest $1,000/mo for 40 years, you would end up with over 5 million dollars, having contributed a total of $480,000. $500/mo would get you over 2.5 million dollars from $240,000 in total contributions.

Afterthought: Investing is much easier than most think, you just need to find the right fund(s) and contribute monthly, can even set that up automatically. It does get slightly more complex as you get older and as you accumulate more wealth. Once you cross a certain threshold of wealth, and Iâ€™m talking $200,000+ invested, itâ€™d be a good idea to get more diversified. And as you get closer to retirement, youâ€™ll want to invest more conservatively. But both of those are just a matter of adding a couple more funds to your portfolio and choosing how much you want in each one.

kt7mt4,disgruntIed_giraffe,"22M living in California, should I go with Roth or Traditional 401(k)?

There are a few factors to consider and I could use some perspective or opinions on sorting it out. Note that regardless of my 401(k) decision, I plan on opening a Roth IRA and maxing that out annually until retirement.

1. Income: My income is ~$70k and I expect to have a lot more in retirement after 40 years of steady contributions. However because of CA taxes, $70k means Iâ€™m already in the 31.3% tax bracket (22% federal + 9.3% CA). Based on todayâ€™s tax rates, my income would have to be a whole lot higher for my future effective tax rate to be more than 31.3%, especially since Iâ€™ll likely be married. [Higher income in retirement is a pro for Roth, though itâ€™s hard to swallow paying 31.3% today thinking itâ€™d be even more in the future]

2. Location: Living in CA puts me in a very high income tax state, and who knows if Iâ€™ll end up here, or somewhere with lower taxes. It would be nice to stay in CA but anything can happen over these next 40 years. [pro for Traditional since I could only end up in an equal or a lower income tax state]

3. Future tax rates: With relatively low tax rates today and the current state of debt, itâ€™s hard to imagine taxes wonâ€™t be significantly higher 40 years from now. I feel a little risk averse on the fear of doing traditional then getting slammed by taxes in retirement. [pro for Roth because expecting future rates to be higher]

4. Pension: I have a small pension plan at my company. Nothing major but it would definitely serve to raise my retirement income. But unless I stay at this company this point is not applicable. [pro for Roth because higher retirement income if I stay with company]

5. Roth reliability: I think itâ€™s less likely but worth noting the possibility of the government finding ways to tax Roth in the future, whether itâ€™s wealth tax, sales tax, or just diminished Roth benefits.

mm42vv,disgruntIed_giraffe,"Looking to buy an apartment for my twenties, then eventually upgrade to a house. Rather than selling the apartment for cash for the next down payment, would it be ideal if feasible to keep apartment as a rental property?

I know a lot goes into that question in terms of the investment value of the specific property, but Iâ€™m just looking for insight on this strategy as a way to broaden my portfolio. If I can save up for the second down payment without needing to sell the apartment, and if I can find renters that will cover the apartmentâ€™s mortgage after moving out, then Iâ€™ll eventually come out owning the apartment and can earn rental income or cash out if needed. My primary and only source of investing right now is saving 15-20% of my income via IRA and 401k, and Iâ€™ll continue to do that until I retire. Iâ€™m thinking anything above that 15-20% could go toward maintaining this property, rather than toward increasing retirement contributions. 

I know I need to be prepared to handle both my apartment mortgage and home mortgage in times when renters fall out, plus plenty of maintenance costs to consider. But assuming Iâ€™m in a good enough financial position to handle those (steady income, big emergency fund), should I make it a goal to pursue this option? If so then when I do buy the apartment that Iâ€™ll live in, Iâ€™ll also have to consider its investment potential rather than just is it a good/affordable place to live.

I like this option because it would increase my portfolio beyond just my 401k and IRA, and I see this as the only way Iâ€™d be able to get into real estate investing, as I donâ€™t want to outright buy a rental property, but soon Iâ€™ll have to buy a place to live, so after a few years I will have some equity in it and be able to make a more informed decision on keeping that property as an investment.","Loss Aversion, Status Quo Bias, Mental Accounting","The statement reveals several biases.

nadmbs,disgruntIed_giraffe,"To pay off or not to pay off debt...

Looking for some friendly â€œWhat Would You Doâ€™sâ€ in my situation. 

I (23M) have close to $30k in student loan debt and am otherwise debt free. The average interest rate is 4.5% with loans ranging from 4 to 5.5%. I have a full emergency fund, save approximately 15-20% of my paycheck in retirement accounts, and save about ~$2k a month in cash that I have not yet determined how to use. The excess cash could go toward: 
* Paying off debt quickly
* Saving for a downpayment on a home (not urgent but I want to be ready to do this in the next few years)
* Increasing retirement contributions

Thinking my main two options are as follows:
1. Put that $2k/mo entirely toward student loans, have them paid off by summer of 2022, then start saving for a house while seeing if thereâ€™s extra room in the budget to increase retirement contributions
2. Make the minimum monthly payments over the life of the loan while prioritizing increasing retirement contributions and start saving for a down payment when necessary. 

The emotional component is in favor of option #1 as I think it would feel great to not have to worry about debt anymore, but I know the loan interest isnâ€™t that high especially since Iâ€™m young, so looking strictly at the math Iâ€™m likely better off investing (though I do think this might be slightly offset by the seemingly increased risk of market uncertainty at this time).

qkpf0y,disgruntIed_giraffe,"Downsides to using my Roth 401k instead of standard Brokerage Account for a 5-10 year investment life?

Background - Iâ€™m 24 with an 80K income in a HCOL area. Iâ€™m contributing 20% of my income toward retirement between a Roth IRA and Roth 401K (might switch to traditional 401K in the coming years but doing Roth for now), which equates to 6K to the IRA and 10K to the 401K, so I still have 9.5K of unused Roth 401K contributions. I donâ€™t want to increase retirement contributions beyond 20% because I feel thatâ€™s a good baseline and that I should prioritize saving for the likelihood of needing a downpayment on a home in the next 5-10 years.

Question - Since my timeline for a downpayment is 5-10 years, I figure I should be investing that money rather than holding it all in cash. Rather than using a taxable brokerage account, would it make sense to save for a down payment via increasing my Roth 401k contributions, with the intention of withdrawing that money in 5-10 years, since thereâ€™s a penalty free early withdrawal exception for first-time homebuyers? If that exception includes the non taxable Roth growth (correct me if it doesnâ€™t), then essentially I can invest without capital gains tax up until reaching my Roth 401K limit, and the downside of not being able to withdraw until age 59.5 is eliminated since this falls under one of the early withdraw exceptions.

rfk1yb,disgruntIed_giraffe,"Does high inflation incentivize holding onto debt?

I have 30K student loan debt with 4.5% interest, and Iâ€™ve always used that 4.5% number as the basis for my internal pay off debt v invest argument, i.e. pay off debt for the security of being debt free and receive a guaranteed 4.5% rate of return, or invest hoping for better returns. 

Now with inflation on the rise, it devalues the amount of debt I have and offsets the interest I owe. Iâ€™m salaried and receive annual inflation-based raises, so letâ€™s assume next year I get a 4.5% inflation raise applied to my salary, that would loosely translate to my loan being interest free in terms of real dollars right?

So now the debate becomes pay off debt for the security of being debt free or invest hoping for better returns, except now the returns just have to beat inflation or it to be net positive. Does my logic here make sense?

Edit: after reading comments I think I can more accurately summarize my viewpoints
* Inflation offsets interest on debt in terms of real dollars
* Assuming 4.5% inflation, the real value of my debt remains the same, but the nominal dollars increases which still affects me, but THIS is offset if I get the 4.5% inflation raise
* Due to the above two points, in the debate of Debt v Investing: interest rate on my debt is no longer a factor in the equation, and if I choose investing, I just need to outpace inflation for a net positive.","Framing Effect, Mental Accounting","The user's analysis of their student loan debt in the context of rising inflation demonstrates a framing effect, as they reframe their debt's interest rate as being offset by inflation, effectively altering their perception of the debt's cost.

Seems incorrect to combine pre-tax/after-tax and say Iâ€™m saving 16k per year, which could equate to a 16% savings rate or 21% depending on whether Iâ€™m dividing by gross or net income.

I figure the simplest and most accurate formula is to do pre-tax savings/gross income + after-tax savings/net income as follows:
* 10k pre-tax / 100k gross income = 10% savings rate
* 6k Roth / 75k net income = 8% savings rate 
* Total savings rate = 10% + 8% = 18%

Does that formula make sense? What else should I consider?

You guys pointed out my rent was too high. You were right. The more I thought about it, the more uncomfortable I got paying 45% of my take-home for rent. I said my take-home pay was $8k/mo but someone in the comments said... wait... did you forget about some taxes? And thank goodness, because I surely did - forgot about SS and Medicare. Shit!

Simultaneously, I had an out - my landlord had not signed the lease (there were some other issues, not the point), so I got out and started looking for cheaper places. I found one for $500/mo cheaper. 

But I forfeited my $1000 security deposit. It's in the contract that if you apply for a lease but don't end up signing, they keep the deposit. Moving was already so expensive for me. That's 3% of my current income, vanished into thin air.

I quite stupidly took out a student loan at 8.5% 12 years ago from my credit union, and now that I have graduated (PhD) my payments are resuming in 6 months. I'd like to be able to plan for this recurring monthly expense. Unfortunately, I have no idea where the loan paperwork is - my mom has passed away, I live 1000 miles from my parents' home, and haven't been able to find the paperwork when I visit.

So call I did. They said sorry, I'm unable to see that information. I asked to escalate the call to ""loan services"". They said the same thing, and told me that I will receive a letter in the mail one month before payments begin with this information, but that they cannot tell me now what my payments will be.

I'm kicking around the possibility of us together buying both halves of a two-family home. The cost I've seen is about 650-700k for two units with one bedroom each.

...I don't see many people doing this, but it seems like a no-brainer. Parent gets to downsize, kid gets to own a house in an expensive area and know their neighbor. There are plenty of duplexes on Zillow where both halves are for sale. What's the catch? Is there anything I'm not thinking about?

I'm in a rough financial predicament right now. I'm a 28-year-old graduate student making $35k/yr, in my last year. In &lt;6 months, I will graduate with my PhD (physics, from an Ivy) and will make approximately 100k. I do not yet have an offer, but I have enough connections in industry that for all intents and purposes, this is guaranteed.

However, my rent just went up by $500/month. When I moved in seven years ago, I paid $1000/month, it went up to $1500/month over the past seven years, and is now $2000. 

My plan was to graduate this May, in which case I would not have had to sign a new lease. However, as my mom passed away and I had to take time off to play home hospice nurse for a few months, I am now graduating in the fall.

As a result, I am chewing through my savings. I will also need to move after I graduate, as I live in the middle of nowhere and my PhD focus is very niche. I am planning on taking out an unsecured personal loan out for first+last+security when I move, as most jobs are in the Boston area where first+last+security will run 8k easily.

My assets/debts are as follows:

* Undergrad student loans: $20k (payment not required until after graduation)
* Monthly expenses: $730
* Vehicles: Both owned outright, car worth $2k motorcycle worth $500
* Emergency fund: $1k
* Investment accounts: $4k
* Roth IRA: $4k


I paid off about $10k of student loans while in grad school, despite not being required to pay, just because I hated seeing the interest rack up. I also put a measly amount of money into an IRA, both of which were kind of stupid as I chewed through my savings so quickly once my rent went up.

**8k take home**

From this, I will take $6k and put into a separate account so that I will never see it. I will pay:

**$500 - student loans** I have about $28k (before any forgiveness) at 4%. I think making the minimum payments here makes sense, as I earn more in the market.

**$500 - Roth IRA** I have a target date fund through Schwab. This will max out my Roth IRA contributions for the year as I understand. Since my job is at a startup, there are no retirement plans or anything.

**$500 - HDHP premium and HSA contribution**. I don't know exactly what health plans are offered by my employer as I don't start formally until February, but if it's an option I'd prefer an HDHP with an HSA. If I can, I'll put $300/mo away in the HSA to max it out. Otherwise this will just be my premium. I'm a healthy single person so don't have much need for a low-deductible plan.

**$3500 - rent/utilities** No way to get around this one, I'm afraid. I've signed the lease and set up utilities. Might go down in the future but not planning on it right now.

**$150 - car/renters insurance combo** 

**$850 - non-tax-advantaged investment account** This will be my emergency fund. I rent and won't need a car for commuting, so I'm okay with this being in the market. Also will help with a car downpayment in the future, or a house downpayment in the far far far far future. At first, this will actually go toward paying off a loan I took out to move - I get a signing bonus which covered a lot, but not everything...

That is the 6k that I won't ever look at. I will then have 2k for spending money:

**$300 - savings account** For things like vacations, gifts, random shit.

**$800 - groceries/restaurant** This is about 20% above what I spend now when I'm lazy about budgeting, allowing a bit of lifestyle inflation (and HCOL inflation...)

**$200 - clothing** I know this sounds ridiculous. My clothes are falling apart, and as a grad student lab rat I've spent most of my days in comfy informal clothing.

**$700 - misc** Vet bills. Cat food. Vehicle fuel. Random shit. Honestly I find that everything that isn't food totally racks up without even thinking about it.

I really need to get my own vehicle soon, but for now am borrowing a relative's. I pay them, but would like to be independent. I have a good amount of cash saved up to buy my own SUV. Looking mostly at used Toyota Rav4's or Subaru Forrester's (but willing to consider any comparable SUV that has a good reputation and is on the cheaper end - Toyotas, Hondas, Hyundais, etc.). 

Where things get complicated....I think...

1. Market seems not great now for buying used cars. Prices seem high from what I've heard

2. This would be my first vehicle I bought on my own (ie without parents)

3. Interest rates are high (not a problem if I use cash, but I also wonder if saving cash and investing it would benefit me more - maybe not worth the risk if its 5% +)

4. I could technically use my relative's car longer, but then they (potentially) lose out on the opportunity cost of selling their car sooner

5. I am also looking for a house to buy asap as well

6. I can also buy the vehicle under a family/my LLC I think

7. If I do a loan, would it make sense in today's market? And how does one go about finding a good loan or dealership that offers rebates (just learned this is sometimes a thing)?

I know the other (gains) on the Roth cannot be taken out so perhaps thatâ€™s the situation itâ€™s better but I would imagine for a lot of people the Ira is a better option especially those with a more traditional life whoâ€™s kids start going to college/get married when the parent is 50â€¦you could have close to 300k between you and your spouse of money you could pull out for things like that and pay 0 tax on it vs paying if you had to take it out of a taxable brokerage assuming youâ€™re still working and making a good salary. Just wondering if Iâ€™m missing something because I feel like I never see this talked about.

skj40s,DoeJumars,"Order of operations, in retirement? (hypothetical)

Hey all,

Lets assume rules and brackets are like they are today, these numbers are my assumptions in 26 years for myself.

**..I am 60, MFJ and retired.**

&amp;#x200B;

* **1.5m** in 401k that I just rolled over to a **Roth IRA (70/30 split stocks/bonds)**
* **900k** (445 in mine, 445 in my wifes- who I contribute to via the spousal Roth since she doesn't work)  **Roth IRA (100% SP 500)**
* **250k in HSA (100% SP 500**

&amp;#x200B;

*...kid(s) are in college/finishing up, I have a 529 setup for them which should cover costs or at least a good chunk of them, so assume they're good there.*

*My wife and I can live off 65k a year. House paid off, if anything we could downsize. This lets us live life, enjoy some vaca's, etc.*

**My question is, what order should I do things? In my mind:**

1. Take out \~85k in IRA money a year which after taxes gives me that 65k I need to live life from age 60-70 or as long as I can (*put off SS until 70*).
2. I have \~25k left that I can roll over from my IRA to Roth and pay minimal taxes on to fill the 12% bracket (MFJ) and let that grow tax free for later via a conversion/ladder whatever you want to call it, Repeat step 1-2 as long as I can until the well runs dry. *All the while my Roth IRA and HSA keep growing, I use the HSA to pay any big medical expense but hoping they wont be that crazy.*
3. My IRA gets milked dry eventually because I am taking out close to 6% a year plus the \~25k I am rolling over which is basically 8%, twice the recommended amount...but instead of doing me 30 years it will do me \~15 which is probably more than I really need since SS is about to hit at 70 for wife and I. 
4. Now I am 70, have put off SS long enough. I don't have much left in the IRA so I can use that to fill lower tax brackets, wife and I are combined supposed to get 59k a year in SS by now which probably will only be taxed at 50% because I am using only \~30k in IRA a year to fill the lower brackets. I still roll over the excess like I have been until I am finally dry of IRA.
5. Now I have no IRA but my Roths have been growing forever, same with HSA and we get a lot of SS. Rest of my life I can pull out anything in Roth tax free, use SS to fill lower tax brackets, HSA for health still...

3. Iâ€™ve always taken standard deduction because my w2 was cut and dry, seeing as Iâ€™m part 1099 now can I write off expenses while taking that standard deduction still or do I have to rework everything and itemize all my stuffâ€¦just wondering if itâ€™s worth it and if Iâ€™ll have more than 25k to write off.

So I'm going home for the last week of December to see my family. It's been about 2 years now so I figured I should check on my nieces just to make sure they're okay and stuff.

If I go home I'll probably still be able to do that but I'll be in a tricky spot money wise (not too bad as in missing rent or anything but I probably won't be able to pay all of those loans at once without risking my security).

So I'm 22, should graduate from Community College in 2024 (I had to take time off due to fear of massive loans, then COVID hit so I transfered to a community college), and I just want to improve my life.

I'm stuck in an apartment building I've lived in for roughly 3 years and I'm tired of being here. I've been a waiter (primarily) since I was 16 and I want to do something new. Also my degree will be in business management.

My plan: 
My lease ends in 2023 (yeah I jumped the gun a few months back and renewed my lease for $50 more a month, making it $1090 a month starting in June) but by then I hope to have a new job. I'm applying for a tsa job but I'm stuck in the background check portion. 

If that doesn't work out I'm going to email my old internship manager (they offered me a spot back but I had just taken a sales job and had to decline out of respect for the new employer). I figured I should email her if and only if I fail the background check because if I ask her too soon then get the position it'll look unprofessional. 

If that attempt doesn't work then I'll move back to Massachusetts because sister in law said she could help me get a good security job. After that I've got no real plan (but considering that's a plan c and potentially 2 years out I don't think it's smart to plan much farther).

In the meantime I'm going to start trying to save $250 to $500 a month from now until June, 2023. I say try because during the winter our restaurant is SLOW, like $60 a weekday slow and maybe $100 on a weekend.

gr8jvo,Droid2Win,"Looking for saving/investing advice

Alright, so the market is super volatile right now, so I'm not sure how great any additional investing options will be. The quick summary is I'm in very good financial shape, and very grateful for it. I'm just looking for advice on how to do even better.

Alright, here are the numbers:

\- I make 96k/yr in a medium COL area.

\- I contribute 12% of my salary to my 401k, plus an employer match of 5%. So I'm contributing a hell of a lot into that already. I have $22k in it currently, the combined contribution each bi-weekly paycheck is $633, and I'm 31 years old, so I feel like I'm in good shape here.

\- I bought a house last year. $200k, new construction, put 20% down so no PMI. Making all my payments on time, plus extra principle payments each month. \~$160k in mortgage debt from this. 3.875% interest rate.

\- Only other debt is my car payment. It's $365/month, the interest rate is 3.5%. I have about $12k left, I'm not in any huge rush to dump money into paying it off given how low the interest rate is.

\- I have an Ally bank savings account. It used to have a much higher interest rate, but that rate has fallen (obviously) to 1.25%. Still higher than a lot of other places, but it's less than half of what it was a year ago. I have $52k in my savings.

Like I said, I'm in good shape. With my Ally account being at a lower interest rate, I'm wondering what options I have to grow my money. Ally offers CDs but only at 1.3%, which isn't worth it at all IMO.

I could move my checking account from Chase to Ally and get the 0.1% interest on that. I keep a few thousand in my checking account for bill pay and whatnot, so getting anything at all on that would be cool. But again, that's nothing.

So, do I have any obvious options to strengthen my financial position even more? I'm already putting a lot of money in for retirement, but are there any other decent investing/saving strategies beyond that?

Edit: Ok, so here is an update after the first wave of responses.

\- This morning I bumped my 401k contribution rate to 20%. My math is a little off on this because I haven't fully factored in and pro-rated my earlier contributions at the lower rate, but roughly I feel this will let me get close to the max for this year. I'll do more precise calculations in the near future, that's something I'm better at. I know that for a full calendar year though 20% puts me right at the edge of the max.

\- I'm looking into IRAs. I want to at least take advantage of the fact that I can contribute $12k this year. I would probably do $6k right away to take advantage of the 2019 extension, and then gradually do the other $6k over the rest of this year to take advantage of spreading the contributions across the market at different times.

Not sure if I'm going to do this heavy contributions to an IRA every single year in the future (although I crunched the numbers and it is appealing), but I want to at least get it started here.

So I'm beginning to try investing in index funds. I opened a Roth IRA with TD Ameritrade, and I've been researching funds there. There are a LOT of stats there, which I love because I'm a numbers/data kind of guy. I just don't have the level of knowledge to properly evaluate what those numbers mean.

First, the past returns. For all these numbers, I'm referring to SPYG. There are two charts, Trailing Total Returns and Standardized Returns. Their numbers are virtually identical, so I'm not stressing distinguishing between them yet.

Alright, so I'm somewhat new to investing. Like so many during the pandemic, I've been taking account of my finances and thinking of ways to do better with it. I've made other posts here, so I won't totally recap everything. I have a good stable job that pays me very, very well, I own a house (well, a mortgage, but still), I have no other debt, and a LOT of cash in the bank because I'm generally very good at saving money.

So, after some conversations here, I made a few changes. First, I started maxing out my 401k. By the end of this year I'll have put in the legal maximum amount to it. Then I opened a Roth IRA and put in $6,000 for the 2019 contribution. I'm slowing moving that $6k into index funds, I did a lot of research and picked a diverse group of them that I like, and I'm trying to DCA mostly because in my non-expert opinion I expect this year's volatility to offer some cool opportunities to grab shares at lower prices so I don't want to throw it all in right away.

I'm wondering if the Robinhood account is the right away to go, especially since I'm investing in index funds. Those will have good rates of return (or so I've read), but only over the long term. I'm 31 right now, so maybe it would be better to stop investing in Robinhood and instead put all my investing money into the Roth IRA.

So I've been trying to learn to analyze a company's financials to see if they are a good investment or not.

So after reading the wiki on this subreddit last year I started investing in index funds. It fits my goals, stable mostly reliable growth of my money over time. I started out doing a bunch of research into different funds and picking a variety to split my money between. Lately though I've been realizing that was pointless and needlessly complicated, given that most of them were just some form of s&amp;p index with different weights.

So instead, I have a new plan to shift my investments too. Yet I'm still sitting here wondering if it is still being over thought. Feedback appreciated.

Also, I haven't settled on an exact formula for splitting funds between them all, was going to start with them all pretty much equal shares of total investment.

VB - CRSPR small cap index fund. Opposite of the large cap stocks in the s&amp;p.

VTI - total us stock index. Might be overkill if I'm doing VOO and VB already, but figure there will be some stuff in here that's not in those two.

m3gw2o,Droid2Win,"Just got my first employee stock grant - questions

So I just got a grant of company stock as part of my compensation package for the first time in my life. It vests over 3 years, so I don't get access to it immediately. Never gotten something like this before, and I'm sitting here reading the docs they gave me with it trying to wrap my head around things. Here are my questions so far:

1) I have 3 vesting dates over the next 3 years. I'm supposed to get 1/3 of the value each date. Does that mean I would get all the shares, but only able to be sold at 1/3 price at that time, or 1/3 of the shares at full price? **UPDATE:** I can answer this one myself, at the end of the documentation there's a table that specifies how many shares I get on which date.

2) It says that once the shares vest, I'm liable for any taxes I might owe. I live in the USA. Would I owe taxes on the stocks right away, or would I only owe taxes when I sell them? I would think it would only be at sale, and whatever tax rate I'm subject to would apply to the whole value of the sale, because the entire thing is basically profit.

3) Dividends. This seems straightforward. Sounds like the dividends will be held by the company, and I will receive whatever proceeds come from them on the same vesting schedule as everything else. Also, as I get the stocks vested, I'll get dividends directly.

4) Could the company restrict my ability to sell shares after vesting? There's a confusing paragraph in their legal document about this. While it's a big and successful company, they're also so big that I don't feel they have a ton of stock growth opportunities. You know, a company that dominates an industry, but is already there so limited further growth room. Anyway, the stock has been flat (up and down, staying the same basic level) for 3 years now.

I also have 40k in an emergency fund. I know that is higher than this sub usually recommends, but for me the opportunity cost is worth it for the peace of mind I get from those reserves.

That being said, I'm looking for better options that my HYSA. I use Ally, I know I've got one of the best savings rates out there, but at the moment that's just 0.5%. I've been reading about I-Bonds, and how they are a good hedge against inflation. Basically a way to preserve the value of my emergency fund.

I wouldn't put all of it into I-Bonds, but I feel up to half would be a good move. I would protect it's value from inflation, and after 1 year I can redeem the bonds whenever I want, I just sacrifice some of the interest. Meaning if I was in a tough spot, I would be able to use the funds from those bonds.

Anyway, wondering about others thoughts on this?

qf35q5,Droid2Win,"What is a good class or similar thing to learn how to evaluate companies for investing?

Hi. So I'm in a very good financial position, and that included investing. While I didn't take investing seriously in my 20s, my early 30s have had me take a huge interest in it. 401k, Roth IRA, brokerage, I'm doing all of it. I'm very confident in the choices I've made so far, since it's been a very simple one: total stock market index fund. With a long time horizon for my investing goals, this is a nice, safe option.

In the meantime I've been studying investing in general. The thing is, the more I know, the more indecisive I become. I stick with the index fund because it's safe, but I do want to make some more direct investments. To be able to pick a company and invest in that stock with a reasonable expectation of a high return from them. I mean, I could totally be wrong, and at times likely will be. And this will not be my entire investing strategy, only a small portion of it, so I view the risks there as low.

When I started down this road, I downloaded a bunch of 10Qs and started reading them. At that point, my brain melted.

So, after this long, far too long post, I'm just hoping someone can direct me to a good source that can teach me how to better ingest and understand this data so I can make informed decisions.

I would rather make investment decisions based on understanding the fundamental economics of a company rather than rely on taking heads and Reddit diamond hands (shudder).

I'm about to start working at a startup on its Series A round of funding. I'm receiving RSUs which will vest over a period of 5 years as a part of my compensation.

If I'm right, then what happens in terms of taxes. For example, one year from now I would get 25% of the shares ""vested"", even though I can't cash them in yet because the company will almost definitely still be private. Would I owe taxes then?

138rys7,Ecstatic_Tiger_2534,"The 28% rule â€“ possible to be in a position to bend the rule a bit?

I'm 31, living in VHCOL city, still renting. I want to buy and have the funds together for a purchase, but the rise in interest rates this past year have put affordability just outside of reach according to the 28% rule, on which I have based my budget.

I am generally risk-averse, but wonder if I just need to become more aggressive to get in and get ahead. It feels like I've been playing leapfrog for years, reaching previous thresholds to become a buyer and then painfully watching market affordability leap back out of reach. I'm still early enough into a strong career trajectory that if I can just break the cycle and make a purchase happen, it *should* become easier to afford over time.

**Here's the specific question:** with a rule of thumb like the 28% rule intended to apply to a wide range of people and situations, how do you know when you're in a position to bend it a bit?

Specifically:

* **I have no other debt.** Student loan and car are paid off, and I never carry CC debt as a rule.
* **I have no dependents.** And have no plans to any time soon, if ever. That's a sizable expense in many people's budgets that isn't a factor in mind.
* **Retirement is solidly on track.** I currently have $150k in retirement funds, which I would not need to touch at all for a home purchase. I max out my 401k and Roth IRA each year and plan to continue doing so, but would have reducing contributions temporarily as a lever to pull if I ever need to divert some cash flow.
* **I'll have a healthy cash buffer**. Even after a 20% DP and closing costs, I'll have a healthy EF/cash buffer so won't be cutting *too* dangerously close to the bone at closing.

It seems that 28% rule is meant to allow room for some combination of other financial obligations (be that other debts or having dependents). And though I plan to still contribute as aggressively to retirement, being on track there offers me some flexibility that others who are behind on saving may not have. **Is there something to this thinking?**

My home buying math:

* I earn $130-150k, depending on bonus. (At least $140k is reasonable to assume).
* Based on the 28% rule, I could afford $3266/mo.
* In my market, I could buy something that meets my needs for $550k. With a 20% DP and assuming a 7% rate, that's a $2,927 payment. After taxes and insurance, that number would exceed the above number and therefore the 28% rule â€“ but it's within stretching distance.

My financial picture:

* Total net worth: $310k.
   * Retirement savings: $150k (between my 401k, IRAs, and an HSA)
   * Downpayment: $110k
   * Remaining $50k to cover closing costs and EF/cash buffer.

Don't get me wrong, I'll feel on the tighter side to start. But if I can make it work for the first year or two, it *should* get easier with time. Otherwise, I fear I'll be stuck always playing leapfrog, each increase in income failing to actually improve affordability as home prices increase just as fast.","Loss Aversion, Anchoring, Status Quo Bias, Present Bias","The statement exhibits several biases.

I'm in my first year of an HDHP w/ HSA plan and am contributing the maximum. I recently hit the minimum threshold to invest (anything above $2k), and was excited to see VFIAX as an option.

I *could* get more house on the dollar in the burbs, but, as a single young(ish) adult, staying near the urban core is still advantageous for me from a dating and social life perspective. I don't need much more than a 1bd condo anyway.

My plan *had* been to save until I had a 20% DP to avoid PMI. But given low interest rates and rapid appreciation in this market, I'm considering buying once I can do 10%, which would get me into the market a year (or more) sooner. I think my PMI would be reasonable given my strong credit score, and that I'd be able to drop it fairly quickly thanks to expected appreciation. Plus, with interest rates so low the math may favor making a lower DP in order to invest the difference into the market, even with the PMI accounted for.

How do I look? What am I not accounting for?

* Salary: $117k base salary, eligible for 15% annual bonus.
* Debts: $0. Had student loans and a car note, but all are paid off
* DP saved: $35k. I deposit $2.5k monthly. 
* Emergency fund: $12k. This is 6mo based of current *living* *expenses*, but I'm adding \~$1.4k monthly in order to reach 6mo of *take home pay* by the time I buy.
* Retirement: $65k between a 401k and Roth IRA. I put in 10% and employer matches 4%. I have zero desire to touch the principal or adjust my savings rate to make buying a home work.
* HSA: \~$3,550 after fully funding for one year. Intend to fully fund this year too.

Based on all the above, June would be when: my DP hits 10% *and* my EF hits 6mo take home pay. Additionally, my annual bonus (\~12K after taxes) should hit by the end of May, which I'd use to cushion closing and moving costs. Seems like there's no reason not to buy this summer, but hoping for either some validation or tough love, whichever may apply.

I have an old 401k that I've been meaning to roll over for about a year now.

I recently received all the gifted US Bonds I was gifted while growing up, and among them was a confirmation slip that had no corresponding bond. The bond was either lost or never received in the mail.

I'll have to submit the paperwork to have the Federal Reserve search for record of the missing bond, but I worry I may not have enough of the necessary information. I don't have the bond's serial number, nor do I have any clue when it was bought. The website seems to say that in absence of the serial number you'll need a pretty tight purchase date range, but I have neither.

There obviously would have a specific year they began using it, and they may have later sunsetted it in a specific year. Perhaps the design evolved over the years too, which could provide a helpful clue. All I know is that this could have been gifted to me no earlier than 1990 and no later than 2009, when the gifter passed away.

The good news: I do have the SSN of the gifter and the denomination of the bond, and imagine those will help the Federal Reserve find the record tremendously.

I (29M) am in the market for a condo in an east coast, HCOL city.

I've largely avoided the obscene rents here by living with multiple roommates in lower-end apartments, but it's high time I move on into a place of my own.

I no longer plan to use this for a DP immediately, but do want to keep the option open in the relative near-term (i.e. reconsidering the market by next fall). Stock market is out, obviously.

How would you make the most of this cash on hand?

Come January, I could put $10k into a new I-Bond purchase, but I'm not sure that this is still worthwhile. The current 6.89% rate for 6mo is still great, but I anticipate the following six months will be lower.

If I move some cash to a 1yr CD or Treasury ladder, I could earn somewhere around 4.7% risk-free. This would lock up some cash for as long as a year, but I think this is fairly compatible with the soonest I can realistically see myself buying.

I could shuffle a chunk between online savings accounts offering sign-up bonuses, earning comparable APY's to my current HYSA while collecting some sizable bonuses along the way. For example, if I move $50k to a Discover Online Savings Account for 60 days, then to a Citi Accelerate HYSA for 90 days, I could collect $950 in bonuses on top of a 2.75% and 3.1% APY respectively. I'd keep total flexibility to use that cash at any time penalty-free (other than possibly sacrificing a SUB), but feels like the most logistical hassle of my options.

suuls1,Elarionus,"Next steps for our household personal finance?

I wanted to get some further advice on the next steps we should be taking for my wife and my personal finance. Here's where we're currently at.

EDIT: I should also mention, my wife's work has an ESOP system.

Gross Income: $125,000 yearly

Contributions to unmatched 401K: $20,500 for 2022

Contributions to Betterment Mutual Fund: $600 monthly.

Current Savings for Emergency Fund: $12,000

Current Savings for House: $983.23

Then, based on the last 3 months in YNAB, our spending percentages:

* Needs (rent, utilities, groceries, home supplies) 40%
* Fun Spending (mostly skiing this winter) 17%
* Transportation (tires, gas, maintenance) 15%
* Long Term (Investments, House Savings, Emergency Fund) 15%
* Gifts/Donations (Tithe, Birthdays, Christmas) 8%
* Medical (PT, Dentist, Eyecare) 5%
* Subscription Services (Spotify/Amazon) 1%

It's a little tricky for me to wrap my head around still, because the tax percentages change throughout the year, and net income ends up being different from gross income, which also means that our savings percentage will be different because the 401K comes out before that 15% going into house, betterment, and EF, etc....

There's just a lot going on here for me to keep track of. What should our next steps be for financial success? Should we open up a Roth IRA to make that $6,000 yearly cap alongside our 401K? Or should we just contribute more and more to the Betterment Mutual Fund? What all do you suggest?","Present Bias, Mental Accounting, Status Quo Bias","The individual appears to be struggling with Present Bias, as they are focused on short-term complexities, such as tracking tax percentages and net income, rather than taking a step back to assess their overall financial situation and long-term goals.

My wife and I are trying to do a lot of things at once with our budget. About 30% goes to monthly needs, about 5% goes to fun, and then the rest goes to several categories like medical, transportation, and long term. Not all long term savings are in long term though. For example, the medical category is something we just throw $200 a month in, just in case there's a big medical emergency in the future. We have a car purchase category that is set to have $30,000 by Jan 2030. I have no idea if that's when our cars will die. Might be sooner, might be later.

zzhtol,Elarionus,"My spouse and I both work. I think we're thinking about W-4s wrong, and we're looking for correction.

We  just went through the IRS calculator, and it's telling us that we may  receive a return of nearly $9,000. We're not sure why. We used the  tables in the 2022 W-4 form for the ""two jobs"" section. Her salary was  at around $75,000 for the first six months of 2022, and then $85,000 for  the last six months of 2022. Mine stayed consistent at around $50,000,  though I worked overtime, so mine came out a bit different.

I  ended the year at $54,000 gross with $3,000 withheld in federal taxes.  She ended the year at $81,000 gross with $12,500 withheld in federal  taxes. There are other things that complicate this, such as our FSA and a  few other benefits her work offers (we utilize the Roth 401k, not  traditional).

We are filling out  new W-4s for 2023 now. I noticed that in the two jobs section, we can  choose to either use the tables, or just check the box and move on,  leaving the extra withholding section empty. Right now, based on the  tables, she should have an additional $340 withheld every paycheck (she  is paid twice monthly). If we leave it blank, that would mean there's a  $7,600 difference, right?

We don't  want to get to April of 2024 and suddenly owe $7,600. But if we really  did overpay our taxes in extreme amounts this year, we wouldn't want to  do that again either. This year felt lean.

To clarify, our annual wages next year should be around $52,000 for me and $85,000 for her.

OUR GOALS: 

_x000D_  
\-	Buy a new car (Toyota Cross SUV Hybrid $30K). We currently own 2 old Toyota corollas with over 200K miles on each. Weâ€™re going to hold on to both as our backup cars since we truly only need one (she works from home). _x000D_  
\-	We are undergoing IVF treatment as the first step to conceiving through surrogacy. Her job contributes $10K towards IVF so we will pay $5k out of pocket (15k total). _x000D_  
\-	In a year or so (or as soon as possible), we will proceed with surrogacy, which will be another $80 to $120K. You have to pay a big chunk of that up front when starting the process. _x000D_  
_x000D_  
FUNDING OPTIONS:

_x000D_  
My wifeâ€™s father is willing to lend us $50K, with interest, once we need it. Probably like 5-6% interest. _x000D_  
\-	As I said, her job will re-imburse us 10K for IVF. _x000D_  
\-	Weâ€™re looking into Toyotaâ€™s factory financing at 2.9% for 36 months for the Corolla Cross, but are open to credit unions if we decide 36 months is too short of a term (keeping in mind we need all we can have on hand for surrogacy).  _x000D_  
\-	Our credit scores are excellent. Never make any late payments on anything. My FICO is 823, Equifax 783 and last time I checked her #s were at tiny bit higher. _x000D_  
\-	Some IVF lending Cos may offer as little as 0% APR, with up to 84 month terms. We could use that for the 15K (Iâ€™m guessing we could then pocket the 10K perk from her job and use towards car/surrogacy). _x000D_  
\-	We can use factory financing (2.9%) or credit union (\~7% Iâ€™m guessing) for car loan ($26k financing). _x000D_  
\-	Borrowing against 401k or home equity are not completely off the table although last resort. _x000D_
