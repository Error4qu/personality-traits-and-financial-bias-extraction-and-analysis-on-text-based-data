fpxv7q,googs185,"Getting out of a difficult housing situation

Iâ€™ve been wanting to post this for a long time and Iâ€™m finally doing it! Please forgive the length of the post.

Iâ€™m currently on the path to FIRE but there is a significant obstacle in the way. Some backstory: While I was living at home with my parents, they made me give them $500 a week that they were â€œputting awayâ€ for me for when I got married/bought a house. The balance reached $30,000 before I got married. We got married and the money wasnâ€™t available (because the money was tied up in one of their houses that my sister and brother in law were living in but couldnâ€™t get a mortgage on because he works under the table). When we went to buy a house 3 years later, they still didnâ€™t have the money because my sister still hadnâ€™t taken over the mortgage. That is problem #1. When we went to buy a house, we were in a rush, unfortunately. We were kicked out of our apartment because the town had purchased the property and the building was going to be demolished. We didnâ€™t want another year lease and decided to start looking for a house. Our former landlord let us live in his basement apartment for a couple of months while we looked. We looked at many houses with our real estate agent and I think she became fed up with showing us so many houses. We looked at houses of all sizes but decided on a very small house, well below my means, to keep expenses down and hasten our journey to FIRE. We found one in the town I grew up in Connecticut and it was listed for $220k, a short sale.  It was on a nice, quiet street within walking distance of the elementary, middle and high schools. There were already 8 bids on the house and our RE agent made us put in a $255k bid, saying we wouldnâ€™t get it if we didnâ€™t (which I think was exorbitant, and I feel that the other bids were LOWER than $220k). The bid, of course, was accepted. I donâ€™t know how, but the house comped on the bank assessment and we were given the mortgage at 3.375%. 

 Here start the problems: The house is a ranch and only 1050 square feet and only has one bathroom with a plastic corner shower (no bath). It has two bedrooms with very small closets and another room without a closet-so only two bedrooms. There is no upstairs living room or dining room, just a space when you walk in that is serving as our dining room in front of the fireplace and picture window. The basement, fortunately, is finished, and the family room is down there, but we need to use electric heaters down there. The furnace is low-efficiency, the cheapest the previous owner could put in. We found out the house was owned by a previously very rich family that lost everything. They didnâ€™t care about the house, as they didnâ€™t plan on staying there. The house was built in the late 1940s, block construction, with no insulation in the walls. It can get cold in the winter and hot in the summer due to lack of insulation and we canâ€™t add insulation without reframing all the interior walls.  The previous owner was a hack and did a lot of work unprofessionally, causing me more work. The lawn and landscaping were horrible, many trees needed to be taken down, I needed to put in new gutters and fascia and spent countless hours removing ivy from the house.  The rear patio had to be replaced since the former owner built it up to the level of the rear door and water would come in the house. The front porch was rotting and I had to have masonry stairs put in. In short, Iâ€™ve probably spent over $20k in upgrades and repairs in the past 3 years weâ€™ve owned the house.  What is worse, our neighborâ€™s house, which is much nicer just sold for $279k. An old lady lived there and kept it immaculate and well-maintained. It  is 1800 sq feet, has 5 bedrooms, 2.5 bathrooms, sunroom and a 2 car garage (we have one car garage). From what my RE agent tells me, we are in a sellerâ€™s market now. When I saw what it sold for, I was fumigating.

I just donâ€™t know what to do. I feel we severely overpaid for the house, we have PMI because I was screwed by my parents on the $30k.  All of the reasons we bought a small house for (savings on utilities, taxes, maintenance, etc) seem to be completely irrelevant and we really arenâ€™t saving much than we wouldâ€™ve paid on a larger home.  Iâ€™m looking for advice. Should we get out of this home? Despite itâ€™s shortcomings, the house is very cute and has curb appeal. It has stucco, which is atypical for our area. The neighborhood is very nice. The school system is top notch. We live very close to my parents and sister/brother in law so they can help with our baby at times. I donâ€™t want to dump money and put an addition on it to bring it up to the houses around it. A local contractor wanted $85k just to increase the size of the master bedroom, add a bathroom and increase the size of the bonus room to add a closet to make it a bedroom. I know Iâ€™ll need to at least add a bath and redo the ONE bathroom it has.

My financial situation: Iâ€™m 31. I make $130k a year, my wife stays home with our infant daughter. I have $28k left in student loan debt currently at a 1.9% interest rate that will be paid off in less than two years. We have one paid off car (a cheap beater to get to work, which is less than 5 miles from my home), and a reliable car with one more year of payments on it. Iâ€™m maxing out my employer 401k  ($19k)and  Roth IRA and  have $20k in an emergency fund. Current investments in retirement funds were at $40k before the crash. I also have about $25k in my checking account ready to use for investing or real estate.

Sorry for the long-winded story. Any advice or suggestions would be appreciated. Again, my goal is to FIRE as soon as possible. Iâ€™m not sure if we should sell the home or stay in it. Iâ€™m not sure if I should start investing in real estate or dump more in the stock market.

px1e6u,googs185,"Changing insurance plan during open enrollment for upcoming birth!

Hey guys, I've been crunching the numbers over and over again to see if it makes sense to pay for a better insurance plan during open enrollment. We're on the path to FIRE right now and savings rate is very important so every decision counts. My wife is currently pregnant with a due date in April. Open enrollment is now and starts in November. I've always used HSAs with HDHPs because I like the triple tax benefit but I'm wondering if it makes sense to increase my premium payments to $774/month for the EPO with no deductible instead of $438 for the HDHP.  I would change back to the HDHP the day after our child is born (qualifying event). The numbers are as follows:.

&amp;#x200B;

* **HDHP**
* $438/month with $2800 deductible and $4500 out of pocket max, 10% coinsurance. Employer pays $40/month into HSA.  6 month cost = $2628 (minus the $240  employer contribution = $2388).
* $2388 + $2800 individual deductible = **$5138** *(plus 10% of costs between $2800 and 4500 , unsure what total bill will be-if bill is over $4500, it would be another* ***$450,*** *bringing the above total to* ***$5588***\*.\*
* **UPDATE**: Family deductible is $5600 with a family out of pocket limit of $9000. If we give birth at the same hospital, we can add **$1300** to the above total for the bill for my child.  That would bring the above total to **$6,888**. Since my daughter wouldn't meet her deductible of $2800, we would miss meeting the family deductible, and in the worst case scenario that both my wife and daughter reach their deductibles of $2800 each, that would be an additional $2800 out of pocket. That would make the final total, including the above premiums for 6 months, **$7888** plus 10% of the bill between $5600 and $9000 (family out-of-pocket limit)

\----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

* **EPO $0 deductible**
* $774/month with $0 deductible, $10000 family out- of- pocket max, $750 hospital admission copay (birth) $30 sick visit copay, $50 specialist copay.  6 month cost = $4644
* $4644 + $750 (hospital admission for birth) = **$5394**

\----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

* **EPO $1000 deductible**
* $500/month with $1000 individual deductible/$2500 family deductible, $4500 out of pocket max individual/ $11,250 family, 20% coinsurance. 6 month cost = $3000. 
* $3000 + $1000 individual deductible = **$4000** *(plus 20% of costs between $1000 and $4500 , unsure what total bill will be-if bill is over $4500, it would be another* ***$700,*** *bringing the above total to* ***$4700***
* Family deductible is $2500 with a family out of pocket limit of $11,500. At the hospital for our last birth, our new baby was charged $1300 for services. If my wife's birth costs $4500 like last time after insurance discounts, she would hit the deductible but the family would have to hit the family out of pocket max of $11,500 so we'd be on the hook for 20% from $4500 up to $11,500, which would be another $1400 and bring the final  total, including premiums for 6 months, to **$6100**.   

Edit: The above-listed deductible for the HDHP is an INDIVIDUAL deductible just for my wife. The family deductible is $5600. This may change the math because our new baby will also receive a bill. We received a bill of around $1300 for nursery charges for our daughter when she was born.

We rarely go to see a doctor since we are young and healthy and I work in medicine and can take care of basic medical needs/prescriptions for my family to avoid the sick visit copays.

I'm assuming the birth will cost around $4000-$5000, based on the cost of the birth of our first child at the same hospital, but there were some complications during that birth, so I'm not sure.

I do max out HSA contributions and I'm not calculating how much I would lose in investment income by not contributing for 6 months. I'd miss out on contributing $3550 tax free and reducing my taxable information by that amount over the 6 months. I think I'd only make a few hundred dollars banking on a 15% return in VTSAX in my HSA (based on last year's market performance-I know we could be going into a recession as well), but I'm trying to figure out if the tax savings would be significant enough to warrant keeping the HDHP plan. The tax savings should be about $1300 figuring a 30% tax bracket. Therefore, the HDHP would be **$6588**  figuring that in.

pyd7n7,googs185,"Help choosing the most tax-effective health insurance plan after having a baby

I've been crunching the numbers over and over again to see if it  makes sense to pay for a better insurance plan during open enrollment.  We're on the path to FIRE right now and savings rate is very important  so every decision counts. My wife is currently pregnant with a due date  in April. Open enrollment is now and starts in November. I've always  used HSAs with HDHPs because I like the triple tax benefit but I'm  wondering if it makes sense to increase my premium payments to  $774/month for the EPO with no deductible instead of $438 for the HDHP based on several factors   I would change back to the HDHP the day after our child is born  (qualifying event). The numbers are as follows:.

* **HDHP**
* $438/month  with $2800 deductible and $4500 out of pocket max, 10% coinsurance.  Employer pays $40/month into HSA.  6 month cost = $2628 (minus the $240   employer contribution = $2388).
* $2388 + $2800 individual deductible = **$5138** *(plus 10% of costs between $2800 and 4500 , unsure what total bill will be-if bill is over $4500, it would be another* ***$450,*** *bringing the above total to* ***$5588***\*.\*
*  Family deductible is $5600 with a family out of pocket limit of $9000. If we give birth at the same hospital, we can add **$1300** to the above total for the bill for my child.  That would bring the above total to **$6,888**.  Since my daughter wouldn't meet her deductible of $2800, we would miss  meeting the family deductible, and in the worst case scenario that both  my wife and daughter reach their deductibles of $2800 each, that would  be an additional $2800 out of pocket. That would make the final total,  including the above premiums for 6 months, **$7888** plus 10% of the bill between $5600 and $9000 (family out-of-pocket limit)

\----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

* **EPO $0 deductible**
* $774/month  with $0 deductible, $10000 family out- of- pocket max, $750 hospital  admission copay (birth) $30 sick visit copay, $50 specialist copay.  6  month cost = $4644
* $4644 + $750 (hospital admission for birth), total 6 month cost = **$5394**

\----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

* **EPO $1000 deductible**
* $500/month  with $1000 individual deductible/$2500 family deductible, $4500 out of  pocket max individual/ $11,250 family, 20% coinsurance. 6 month cost =  $3000.
* $3000 + $1000 individual deductible = **$4000** *(plus 20% of costs between $1000 and $4500 , unsure what total bill will be-if bill is over $4500, it would be another* ***$700,*** *bringing the above total to* ***$4700***
* Family  deductible is $2500 with a family out of pocket limit of $11,500. At  the hospital for our last birth, our new baby was charged $1300 for  services. If my wife's birth costs $4500 like last time after insurance  discounts, she would hit the deductible but the family would have to hit  the family out of pocket max of $11,500 so we'd be on the hook for 20%  from $4500 up to $11,500, which would be another $1400 and bring the  final  total, including premiums for 6 months, to **$6100**.

**HDHP= $7888 ( $6588** if subtracting the $1300 HSA tax benefit)

**EPO $0 deductible = $5394**

**EPO $1000 deductible = $6100**

We  rarely go to see a doctor since we are young and healthy and I work in  medicine and can take care of basic medical needs/prescriptions for my  family to avoid the sick visit copays.

I'm  assuming the birth will cost around $4000-$5000, based on the cost of  the birth of our first child at the same hospital, but there were some  complications during that birth, so I'm not sure.

I  do max out HSA contributions and I'm not calculating how much I would  lose in investment income by not contributing for 6 months. I'd miss out  on contributing $3550 tax free and reducing my taxable information by  that amount over the 6 months. I think I'd only make a few hundred  dollars if there is a 15% return in VTSAX in my HSA (based on last year's  market performance-I know we could be going into a recession as well),  but I'm trying to figure out if the tax savings would be significant  enough to warrant keeping the HDHP plan. The tax savings should be about  $1300 figuring a 30% tax bracket. Therefore, the HDHP would be **$6588**  figuring that in.

Any advice on the best plan to go with would be appreciated!","Loss Aversion, Anchoring, Mental Accounting, Present Bias","The individual is meticulously analyzing different health insurance plans to optimize their expenses, reflecting a strong present bias, prioritizing short-term savings.

\*Originally asked in r/realestate but just got downvoted to hell without any insight so if this isn't the right place for this either feel free to delete, but I don't know who else to ask

Hello, hope everyone is well.

I am currently in the market for a new apartment, I've been in my current apartment for the past 18 months with no issues however they are starting construction on several units in January so I'm trying to get a head start and get moved into a new place ASAP so I can help offset the move in costs instead of just paying another 2-3 months rent here that will go towards nothing. I'm trying to keep the monthly rent around $1200, which is average for a 1/1 in my area. There are a couple issues I'm a bit worried about though:

1. I am currently furloughed with full benefits from work due to the pandemic. I work for a large prominent resort in the area that pretty much everyone knows about but it could still be a few months before we go back. I have a comfortable savings, investments, am still able to collect $1100/month from unemployment insurance, and will be getting my deposit back from my landlord. I have very low expenses elsewhere and have zero doubt in my mind that I would ever have issues paying my monthly rent.
2. I have an attempted burglary charge from 2015. Long story short, it was something I had nothing to do with, wrong place wrong time, I spent lots of $$ on an attorney and fought the best I could but had to settle with probation, and after a few hiccups I completed it successfully and have NO felony conviction. It hasn't affected my past three jobs that ran background checks.. my current one, another hotel, and a country club in a gated community. My current apartment was taken over from a friend so my current landlords didn't run one due to a good word of mouth recommendation from my friend who had been here for three years previously.
3. I don't have any rental history on record besides what my current landlord could verify over the past 18 months. I've never rented something by myself before this. My credit score is 650+ according to CK as I've been working on rebuilding it over the past two years and I have no serious debt or collections on my report, nor any type of eviction history.

What are my chances of getting past the application process? Am I better off trying to stick to private owners? Realtors? Large apartment communities? I tried to supply as much info as possible but if there's anything else I could add that would help let me know. I appreciate any type of info/recommendations/suggestions anyone could offer.

After covid lay offs I'm finally back with my old employer again, this time however we are getting the 401k match now so I did the full 5% for the 4% match. I'm also working on maxing my Roth again, have a $230 DD set per pay period, as well as my HSA, and will do the full 15% for ESPP come the next purchase period.

Currently have my Roth with Fidelity in 70 VTI/30 VXUS, T Rowe 401k in 70 VITPX/30 VTSNX, and for the HSA with UMB I'm still waiting for it to hit $1000 so I can invest it but my only two options there are VFIAX or VTSAX, no decent international funds, so leaning more towards VTSAX for that one but wouldn't mind just the single sp500 fund since other two are basically tracking total world

I guess I'm wondering if it's ok to be invested in the same indexes in multiple accounts/platforms or if I should try and allocate everything as a single portfolio. I'm 34 so would like to hold out on bonds for another 5-10 years. I am hoping to be able to start buying iBonds though after I max everything else out, hopefully the full 10k a year.

Side note for the 401k.. I have the option with T Rowe to self-direct it, couldn't I essentially then just put it into VTI/VXUS as well?","Status Quo Bias, Mental Accounting","The statement reveals that the individual is considering investing in the same funds across multiple tax-advantaged accounts, which suggests a tendency to maintain the current state of affairs, characteristic of Status Quo Bias. Additionally, the separate consideration of each account (401k, Roth, HSA, ESPP) and the desire to allocate each one individually, indicates Mental Accounting, where the individual is treating each account as a separate mental account rather than a unified portfolio. The individual's willingness to stick with the default or similar investment options across accounts (e.g., VTI/VXUS in the Roth and potentially in the 401k) also supports these biases.","The individual exhibits a bias towards maintaining the status quo and mentally compartmentalizing their investments across different accounts, rather than taking a holistic approach to portfolio management."
10wkqz6,Great-Sea-4095,"401k should I get a 457b or ira and make it not so aggressive?

I currently have a 401k and probably retiring in 20-25 years. My allocations are in s&amp;p large cap, mid, small, international and international fund. I guess you would classify this as â€œaggressiveâ€. Should I get another 457b or Ira and put it say in a target fund to make it less aggressive?","Status Quo Bias, Loss Aversion, Framing Effect","The statement exhibits Status Quo Bias as the individual is hesitant to change their current investment allocation, seeking to create a less aggressive portfolio through alternative accounts rather than rebalancing their existing 401k. Loss Aversion is also present, as the individual is concerned about the potential downsides of their current ""aggressive"" allocation and seeks to mitigate potential losses. Additionally, the Framing Effect is evident in the way the individual frames their current allocation as ""aggressive"" and seeks to create a less aggressive portfolio, implying that the current allocation is somehow risky or undesirable.","The user tends to favor maintaining the status quo and avoiding potential losses, leading them to consider alternative accounts rather than adjusting their existing portfolio."

I currently have a 401k regular not ira with a 15% cont. I was interested in maxing it, but Iâ€™ve been reading a lot of your guys posts it seems like if you donâ€™t have a match I shouldnâ€™t be maxing ?? Help","Confirmation Bias, Status Quo Bias, Authority Bias","The statement suggests that the individual is inclined to maximize their 401(k) contributions but has been influenced by reading posts (likely online forums or social media) that suggest not maxing out a 401(k) without a match. This indicates Confirmation Bias, as the individual is seeking validation for their existing inclination and is swayed by the opinions they have read. The fact that they are questioning their initial desire to max out their 401(k) due to these posts also reveals a Status Quo Bias, as they are hesitant to deviate from the default or common advice. Furthermore, the individual appears to place significant weight on the opinions expressed in the posts, implying an Authority Bias, where they are deferring to the perceived expertise or collective wisdom of the online community.","The user exhibits a tendency to seek validation for their financial decisions through selective information gathering and is influenced by perceived authority, leading to potentially biased decision-making."

 My banks savings account rate is really low, basically non existent and unfortunately me and my family are not super financially literate so Iâ€™m just realizing about HYSA this past year ! So is there any point of having a standard savings account vs a HYSA or it simply a storage system so you donâ€™t lose your money as if it were under your mattress ?","Present Bias, Status Quo Bias, Affect Heuristic","The statement reveals several biases. The user's dismissive tone towards a standard savings account, saying ""what's even the point?"", suggests a Present Bias, as they are prioritizing short-term gratification over long-term financial planning. Additionally, their lack of concern for the current account and hesitation to switch to a High-Yield Savings Account (HYSA) indicate a Status Quo Bias, as they seem reluctant to change their current financial setup. The user's emotional tone and casual language, such as ""basically non-existent"" and ""storage system"", also imply an Affect Heuristic, where they are making financial decisions based on intuition and emotions rather than thorough analysis.","The user exhibits biases that lead to a short-sighted and emotionally-driven approach to financial decision-making, prioritizing convenience and familiarity over potentially more beneficial options."

22,500 is the max per year. Since there is no match, do you think using the remaining 11,250 say $5000 dca each in 2 index fund etf like voo or schd or even a good stock ? thoughts ?","Mental Accounting, Present Bias, Framing Effect","The statement reveals several biases. The user is considering contributing 50% of their income to a retirement account without a match, and then allocating the remaining amount to other investments, such as index fund ETFs or individual stocks. This suggests Mental Accounting, as the user is compartmentalizing their investments into separate accounts and making decisions based on the specific account's characteristics rather than their overall financial goals. The user's focus on the short-term flexibility of contributing $5000 at a time also indicates Present Bias, as they prioritize immediate control over long-term benefits. Additionally, the framing of the question, particularly the consideration of using a large sum ($11,250) for a ""good stock"" rather than a diversified investment, reveals the Framing Effect, where the user's perception of the investment opportunity is influenced by the way the question is presented.","The user exhibits a tendency to make fragmented investment decisions based on short-term considerations and mental compartmentalization, rather than a comprehensive evaluation of their financial goals and risk tolerance."

The individual provides relevant background information, including their age, income, and future plans to upgrade to a private home. There is no apparent emotional attachment, overreliance on a specific perspective, or reluctance to consider alternative viewpoints.

I have a company 401k and havenâ€™t personally used the auto rebalancing option. Is that something youâ€™d reccomend having on ? I plan on retiring in 20 plus years if that matters.","Status Quo Bias, Present Bias","The user's statement reveals a potential Status Quo Bias, as they seem hesitant to deviate from their current state of not using the auto rebalancing option, implying a preference for maintaining the status quo. Additionally, the user's long-term retirement horizon of 20+ years may lead to a Present Bias, where they prioritize their current situation over their future goals, potentially causing them to overlook the benefits of auto rebalancing in achieving long-term investment objectives.","The user exhibits a tendency to favor inaction and prioritize their current situation, potentially hindering their long-term financial goals."
