I have an entry level job paying around 40-45k a year

I have 45k in student loans all federal. They vary in interest rates but  highest is 5.2%. - Should I refinance? 

I lease a car and have and have 14 months left totaling $3,600.. I plan on possibly buying out the car or financing it. - Should I do either? 

I rent an apartment and pay around $1,100. 

I have an emergency fund saved of 10k. - Should I continue to build it or look to put my money elsewhere?

I have no credit card debt and my credit score is considered ""very good""

I started my er contributions again and contributing up to the er match. 

As a 24 year old going forward what should I focus on/ what should my financial goals be for myself? I thought about starting to invest but don't know if that is a good idea for me given my low salary. I am looking for a new job and planing to move home for a few months once my lease is up in a few months. Also what should I do with my car?

The fact that they are considering buying out or financing their leased car, despite having only 14 months left on the lease, may indicate a Present Bias, as they are prioritizing short-term convenience over potentially more cost-effective long-term decisions. Additionally, the user's consideration of refinancing their student loans and their emergency fund size may be Anchored on the current interest rates and the $10k emergency fund, respectively, rather than considering the bigger picture. The user's hesitation to start investing due to their ""low salary"" may also indicate a Status Quo Bias, as they are maintaining their current investment strategy (i.e., not investing) rather than exploring alternative options.","The user's financial decision-making is influenced by a tendency to prioritize short-term convenience, rely on mental anchors, and maintain the status quo, potentially hindering their long-term financial progress."

To preface my parents immigrated to the US in their mid 20s with two kids. From what I understand, their home country did not have â€œretirement plans.â€ They did not invest their money in the stock market. Because my dad had a very stable and high paying job, they did better than most. Then they immigrated to the states and continued to use the same mentality, thinking that through hard work they will be able to achieve what they wanted. My parents decided to invest in the family and bought a house without having the money for one. They still have that mortgage (I believe its a 30 year one). They racked up about 20k credit card debt. My dad started his own transportation business therefore never had a 401k or an IRA. They also lease their cars and believe that theyâ€™re saving money long term because they donâ€™t have to pay for car repairs. They pretty much live paycheck to paycheck from what I understand and have little savings. I dont think they have an emergency fund. My dad has been talking to his buddies who have been investing from a young age and opened up a fidelity account. He put 1k into random stocks that he heard â€œare doing wellâ€ and is seeking advice from me because I work in finance. I am not a financial advisor or an investment banker and only know what I know from work and my own research but I feel like I am in no position to give advice, especially knowing that debt and emergency savings are priority over investments. The only thing I could think of i advising them to open roth iras or SEP iras but even then I dont know what Iâ€™m talking about. My dadâ€™s goal is to invest for 5-10 years and have something to give to his children because he realized he doest have much to provide for us.

Which how much does that role suck- but Iâ€™m stuck thinking look what happens when I donâ€™tâ€¦.

For example: we like a 2k buffer in our checking account. I know itâ€™s not necessary but itâ€™s comfortable. We overspent and got it down to 600. I said how about no frivolous spending until we build it back, she responds by buying shoes.

Should he do the calculations himself and tell them that he wants to increase the contributions to XYZ amount or just ask them directly to â€œmax the contributionsâ€ and let them calculate themselves and deduct the respective amount?

125ufib,l00t9,"How will my dadâ€™s Rollover IRAâ€™s withdrawals be taxed in the future?

My dad (66) had a 401k with his previous employer which he withdrew in 2018 because he was contemplating purchasing a house. That never happened and the money is now sitting in something called a â€œRollover IRAâ€ in Fidelity. He ended up having to pay $8k in taxes on that $100k withdrawal.

Since the past 3 years, I taught him to start contributing $7k into an IRA to save up on taxes. He didnâ€™t have to create a separate â€œtraditional IRAâ€ for this and instead, the contributions keep going into this â€œRollover IRAâ€.

Now what confuses me is thisâ€¦ the balance in this Rollover IRA consists of two things:

1) the old 401k balance which he withdraw and already PAID TAXES on, and 

2) the current $7k contributions heâ€™s making yearly, which are PRE-TAX.

So when he starts taking RMDs or withdrawing money from this Rollover IRA, wouldnâ€™t it be complicated to figure out taxes?

We will be moving soon from New Jersey (no-fault state) to Indiana (non no-fault state). The first thing I noticed is how the Auto insurance has way lower premiums in IN than NJ (almost half the premiums!).

viwp94,lagflag,"Pause retirement savings or PMI?

I live in NJ, paying inherited low rent (was through some program) in a non-desired small apartment, and eventually would need to move to a better school area when our child is at the school age at most.

I have saved already in cash (not to include retirement accounts) $128K, but according to YNAB I have only $31K can be used as down payment, while the rest is distributed among various categories (such as $33K for an upcoming second car since we have only one car now).

My wife is currently staying home, but once our child hits 2 years old mark she plans to send her to a daycare and search for a job (hence the need to the second car). My gross income is a bit over $100K. The choice I made is to pause the retirement savings (only contribute to 401K up to the employer match) so any extra would be put towards the home down payment (20% down + closing costs would be around $100K in NJ!).

The other choice I could do, is to forget about the 20% and do only 5% or so (with PMI) or more while continue maxing out retirement accounts. Also contributing to 401K would save me (in addition to the deferred federal income tax) another 3-5% in state income taxes. 

We are in our mid forties and a bit late with retirement savings ($233K as of today are in retirements accounts). Any advice?

yly4k7,lagflag,"Switching jobs- Am I doing the right thing? (sanity check)

 

Currently living in HCOL in NJ with wife and 2 years old.  
I am making $110K (including 401K match) and got an offer from an out of state employer for $125K (no 401K match- but better health insurance savings, could mean another $4K-$6K)  


Pros of the new employer in addition to the higher pay:  
\- 100% remote work is acceptable, allowing me to live somewhere cheaper (wife is staying home for the child currently, so moving out is relatively easy)  
\- Good culture (unlimited PTO, nice boss, etc)  
\- Better exposure to other things in my career  
\- Promising growing fast company  
\- New software to learn (will help my resume)  
Cons:  
\- New employer always comes with new risks and lot of what ifs  
\- Startup (not established in the market yet) company  


Pros of the existing employer:  
\- Have been over 6 years there, so relatively stable  
\- Team of 2 reporting to me (new employer can have this later, but now I will drive solo despite the same managerial title)  
\- Adopting new software, so I will have that too in my resume  
Cons (in addition to lower pay and have to live in HCOL NJ):  
\- I got really bored of the current tasks and feel I could get rusty over time at that level!  
\- Commuting (some times they can allow WFH for some reasons if I explained)  
\- Sharing the office with another coworker (not a real cons comparing to a cubical!)  
\- At expensive part of NJ (Central). I cannot move to south areas where houses are cheaper  


I already accepted the offer and when I did so I was so excited about it (and still), but haven't yet notified my current employer.  
Questions:  
\- Does the move make sense financially? I mean by that, risk (of something new versus something I know well) worth the salary difference?  
\- Which state and county I would be better at within the East coast (priority: schools- Health care- weather- lower cost of living specifically housing- diversity- quietness).  


My financial position is not great, but not very terrible as well. NW of about $330K. Don't own a house. no debts. In mid 40â€™s (age). Paying a low rent due to government program, but will eventually need to move anyways to a better school district where I will pay the market value for NJ (if stayed with current employer). That will mean no more savings for retirement will be left.","Loss Aversion, Anchoring, Framing Effect","The user's decision-making process exhibits several biases.

I have the initial savings for emergencies, bought some SP500, etc. I also have a 401k match account, so this would be a new account and I have been trying to educate myself on it this past week, I see that April 14 is the last day I can contribute to my 2021 acc so I should prob take advantage of that.

Location: Midwest USA in a medium cost of living area.

I am 35M, wife is 34F. We are planning on trying for a baby in a few months and will need a slightly larger house with more bedrooms. We would like to rent out our current house and buy another house to live in. 

My income: gross: $96,000.
Wife's income: gross is $33,000. When we have a baby she will stop working for a few years. 
Bonus income: rent out a cottage for $650 per month. 

We currently have a house and a side cottage. 
Mortgage is $800 per month that is escrowed.
House was only $75000 when it was bought in 2014. Came with a neat side cottage that we rent out.

Expenses:
Current house Mortgage: $800. Will increase to $900 if I rent it due to insurance going up when it switches from homeowner occupied to a rental.
Wife's car: $350.
My car is paid off. 
My wife sends $500 each month to help support her parents.

Phone and internet is total of $380.

Food is $800 per month. 

Water bill is $110.

Electric bill is $275.

My student loans will resume soon and will be $283 per month. 

Entertainment: $400 per month.

We would like to buy a new house but all of the houses are much more expensive with high interest.  We were approved for a $280,000 conventional loan though. 

We would like to rent out our old main house for $1200 and the cottage for $650 if we get a new house.
We will also still pay the water bill at the old house. 

If we buy a $250,000 home then the monthly mortgage escrowed will be about $2,500 per month. 
If we buy a $200,000 home then then monthly mortgage escrow will be about $2000 per month.

Quite a bit of new expenses plus the old mortgage increasing by $100 from $800 to $900.

$450 for phone (interest-free until March of next year)

$17684 in federal student loans (average 4.16% fixed interest rate, PSLF/RePAYE)

iizmke,littledorysunshine,"Is pet insurance worth it?

I have a dog and a cat, and have pet insurance for both. They each have a deductible and the reimbursement is 90% after the deductible is met. It covers preventative/wellness care, which is everything we've done so far this year.

Year-to-date amount spend at the vet $2200. Didn't get a breakdown by pet, but most of it is the dog. Dental and a year's worth of flea/tick/heartworm preventative was about $1400. Granted, this is over 8 months but I've finished all the preventative care I need for the year. Unless one of them gets sick/injured I don't expect any more vet expenses.

This is the new premium amount for the 2020/2021 benefit year (cat's renewed in July, dog's in September). It was less last year, and goes up a little every year.

Cat: $100 deductible, $465.83 annual premium.

Dog: $250 deductible, $976.63 annual premium.

Total annual premiums: $1442.46

Mortgage is the balance of a 15 year refinanced in 2012 for $200k (but I've been paying extra principle each month). FMV around $750k. 
$30k annual rental income
$4k mortgage interest last year
$12k other expenses (prop tax, repairs, bus expenses)
-----
$14k net profit

I anticipate that I will spend $1.5m on a new house. Not sure what I will put down (depends on where we shake out in the divorce settlement), but no plans to sell the rental property or use it as my primary residence since it's too small for me and my kids. 

Since interest in residential property is now capped on mortgages up to $750k, while business mortgage interest is not, should I refinance the rental for a higher $, taking out money from it to pay down more on the primary residence and result in larger business mortgage, more business int exp, less business income to be taxed?

j3z4dq,lljc00,"How much do I need to earn to afford a house (SF Bay Area)?

How much do I need to earn to afford a $700,000 mortgage?

TLDR: Why are my annual numbers so off from my monthly numbers?  Is 4X borrowing estimate too conservative (or meant for people who have expensive lifestyles)?

I'm in the process of getting divorced, 2 elementary school aged kids.  Haven't worked in 10 years, but when I did, I was making $120K in tech.  Probably can't do that job again because of the commitment level, but a related job made \~$100K in 2010 dollars (any guesses what that might earn today??)

Homes in the area I want to buy are around $1.5M.  Mind you, these aren't for great homes (ugly 60's ranch houses), but the neighborhood and schools are good.  I'm thinking after the settlement, I would have $800K to put down (53%).  So with a remaining mortgage of $700K, would I be needing to bring home $175K gross using a 4X (4 times salary) estimate?

Now, I know not all of that would need to come from my earned salary.  I estimate I'll get child support of around $3,000 per month, which would equate to being about $48K of salary ($3,000 x 12 = $36,000 net, =appx $48K before taxes at effective tax rate of 25%, for purposes of getting numbers in ""gross"" terms, since not taxed on child support).  So does that leave me at needing to get a job of around $127K?

Here are numbers in gross/annual calculations:

|$700,000|Mortgage|
|:-|:-|
|$175,000|Needed ""Income"" using 4X borrowing rate|
|$48,000|Child support (annualized, and adjusted into before tax gross equivalent)|
|$127,000|Needed income from job|

&amp;#x200B;

Here are numbers in monthly, assuming $700K mortgage at 3%

&amp;#x200B;

|$2,953|Principle and interest|
|:-|:-|
|$1,406|Prop tax (zillow estimate, but I think it should be more like $1000)|
|$67|Insurance (zillow estimate, but is probably should be a little more??)|
|$4,426|Total to service the house|
|$3,000|Child Support|
|$1,426|Amount needed after paying for food, utilities, etc|
|$2,500|My estimate needed of take home (paying for food, utlities, etc).  I'm a pretty conservative spender and can eat top ramen for 5 years if I had to ;-)|
|$3,333|Estimate of Gross (using 25% effective tax rate)|
|$40,000|Annualized salary|

So by the monthly, I should have no problems.  But by the annual, I really need a very well paying job.  What am I missing in these calculations?  Is 4X too conservative in the Bay Area (and esp for me, given I am a low risk defaulter with 50%+ down).  I know that child support wont all go to housing, of course.  So, say that $40K job needs to be an $80K job.  But still.  $80K job vs $127K+ job - big difference.

And if the Annual calculations are more realistic, are my 40 something neighbors really making that much money?  Or do they too have so much money to put down?  Example is a family from our kids' school that lives in house bought for $1.2 (worth $2M now).  Dad works in insurance (so, non tech, no options).  Mom doesn't work.  Assuming they put $240K down, taking on a $960K mortgage would have needed to be making  close to $200K using an aggressive 5x multiplier, or $320K using a conservative 3x multiplier.  And that would have been 10+ years ago when they bought the house.

j9so7a,lljc00,"Is mortgage interest on rental property more like a tax ""credit"" than a deduction?

Sometimes people seem to make a (false) argument that paying residential mortgage interest is good (vs none) because you get a deduction on it (let's assume you are itemizing and not taking standard deduction because we are talking large amounts in the expensive SF Bay Area real estate market). I describe it as ""false"" because, while yes you get a deduction, you still had to pay it. 

So if you pay $30,000 in interest, you out-lay cash of $30,000. On your tax return, you claim the deduction $30,000, lowering tour taxable income by $30,000, thus saving you $7,500 (assume 25% tax rate). So it's as if you ""only"" paid out $22,500. But compared to no mortgage, you're still out $22,500.  (And when I say ""some people"" make this argument, I don't mean the fine people of personalfinance of Reddit, of course. I mean my husband ...)

Does the same apply for mortgage interest on rental property?  Assume the rental is cash flow positive. Does it make sense to pay down the mortgage (if you can) and avoid interest despite being able to use it to offset rental income (because you still have to outlay the cash and only receive some benefit for reduction of taxable income)?  Or is it better to keep some interest expense to offer the rental income?  

And for the sake of the question, let's not assume any other opportunity cost of what you'd use the money for otherwise, whether interest rates are super low or high, or what tax bracket you are in. 

So probably my title should be ""Is mortgage interest on rental property more/less/equally valuable as residential mortgage interest from a tax perspective?""","Framing Effect, Loss Aversion, Self-Attribution Bias","The user's statement reveals several biases.

jffxbe,lljc00,"Buy, refi, payoff oh my!

TL;DR What should I payoff or not pay off, and in what order, so I can buy the best primary residence I can afford after divorce.

I (50F) am in the process of getting divorced after 13 years, 2 elementary aged kids, SF Bay Area, Credit Score around 840 (I have credit cards in my maiden name that won't be disrupted with divorce).  I have:

$750,000 FMV 1BR/1BA Rental House (protected by pre-nup), rental income $2500.

\-$94,000 remaining mortgage on Rental House, about 7 more years left, 3.125%, monthly is $1500 (really $1390, but I put extra toward principle)

\-$6,000 remaining balance on student loan debt, about 5 years left, 2.125%, monthly is $125.

$100,000 very liquid cash

$300,000 investment accounts, not as liquid, but still pretty liquid

$1.3m retirement accounts (protected by pre-nup)

$1.0m estimate of net settlement.  This is a complete SWAG, but lets use it for purposes of this discussion.  Also assume the $100,000 and $300,000 are also the ""cleared"" amount after settlement - meaning my take away is $1+.1+.3 = $1.4m.  I list them here separately to show my liquidity position (whether that's valid or not, I'm not sure).

I will need to retitle the rental house, and hopefully soon after settlement, buy a primary residence for my kids and me.  Estimate that this will be around $1.2m-$1.4m depending on fixer or move in-able condition.

Also I should add that I am not employed, but will be looking for a job probably starting in January.  I think I can easily get a job for $70,000 that gives me flexibility to pick the kids up after they are back in school, but if I really put myself back into my previous ambitions, I can probably get a $120,000 job.  But I don't really want that because I had no spare time with that job, and I really need that now as I expect to have more than 50% responsibility (if even only 50% custody; mom job, right?).  So let's assume $70,000, and let's assume $3500 take home per month.

I expect $3000 in child support (no alimony - pre-nup :-(  ).  That could go lower depending on the job I get.

Rental property rents for $2500, but say $2000 after considering property taxes.  Mortgage payment is $1500 with the current mortgage.

&amp;#x200B;

So, what should be my ordered plan once everything is settled?  Here are the things that can/should happen:

* Refinance Rental or just pay off Rental?
* Pay off student loan
* Buy primary residence

I'm wondering whether it makes sense to just pay off the rental vs refinance and have to pay closing costs/fees (I don't even know what that might amount to - $3000 in administrative paperwork, $1000 in origination fees?).  But I'd hate to lose the cash to put toward the primary residence.  I know I can cash-out refi this property (say, to put towards the primary), but I believe that I lose any tax deductibility of the mortgage interest since the funds wouldn't be put toward that property.

Should I just pay off the student loan to make sure I don't have any dings for existing debt?  Or will that make me look worse for ""closing"" an account?

For the primary residence, I'm thinking of buying at the low end whatever I can buy with all cash (meaning a fixer).  Then after I get a steady stream of income, do a cash out refi and remodel it.  So potentially buy $1.2, then take out, say $250,000 in the future to remodel.  So my LTV would still be very favorable to any bank.

On the other hand, a $1.2-$1.4 means usually 1,200 sq ft, and I'd really like to get a few hundred more sq ft to be able to carve out an office space, so I'd like to be more in the $1.5-1.6m range.  Can I get a loan using child support and rental income (14 year rental history) alone?  ($1.5m would still be fixer upper for something around 1,400 sq ft - sad, I know, and no, I'm not moving out of the area; this is home now.)

Should I look to buy the primary before doing anything on the rental so I don't have multiple transactions on my record, meaning either less to possibly borrow or a higher interest rate?  I know this probably wont be an option since 1) need to retitle shortly after settle (but say I had 6 months to do so; what should I want/ask for in settlement?) and 2) may take a while to find the right house.  But if the stars aligned and I did my timing right, would it be better to transact the primary residence first before the rental property?

kj9upm,lljc00,"Investment firm recommendation; offers asset-based mortgages

Most of my money (retirement) is held in accounts with Fidelity.  I will shortly get a large sum of money when my divorce is finalized.  I am not employed, though will be looking for work shortly.  I would like to buy a house, and finance it with a mortgage (to take advantage of low rates, as well as not have all the money tied up in the house, though I could probably purchase it outright with the cash from the settlement).

w4i0bv,lljc00,"Traditional vs Roth IRA - a different take on the argument, specifically with a 401k rollover

So, I understand the argument and get the math that if your tax bracket today vs at retirement are exactly the same, then it makes no difference whether you put your equivalent money in a traditional IRA (using the pre-tax amount) vs a Roth IRA (using the smaller after-tax amount).  I'm probably incomplete with that description, but hopefully you know the oft discussed argument I'm referring to.

But I think there's an argument to be made for preference for a Roth IRA when rolling over from a 401k (and assume you have 5-10 years of contributions built up).  With a 401k rollover, doesn't it make more sense to put the whole thing into a Roth IRA because 

1. there isn't a pre-tax vs post-tax with this money since you aren't supposed to touch it\*, lest you incur the 10% penalty.  Also assume you pay taxes with money from your checking/savings/brokerage account. 
2. you aren't often given this opportunity to contribute to a Roth at this amount.  On top of that, you got to put in a lot more money into your 401k per year over the 5-10 years than an IRA.

xnx3re,lljc00,"SGOV vs SHV vs SHY yields/prices

I bought SGOV (0-3 mo treasuries) and notice that the per share price goes up from say 100.06 to 100.22 over the course of the month, then they declare the dividend, then the per share price goes down after the last day of the month. Presumably this is the maturity of the basket of the underlying t-bills. No big deal about the per-share ""decrease"" because you get the interest payout about a week later. (i.e. you aren't really ""losing"" because you have the $0.15 cash back in your account.)

But what about something like SHV or SHY? Do these also essentially do the same thing? Are the dividends also paid out on a semi-regular schedule, coinciding with the maturities of the underlying t-bills? SHV's chart (less than 12 months) looks like maybe it has this pattern. But SHY's chart does not??

Asking because if the 1-3 year treasuries are yielding better than the 0-3 month treasuries, why not just buy the SHY ETF so I have some liquidity, say 6 months from now? Is SHY not exactly like the underlying treasury because the underlying note that's paying 4% isn't going to be distributing that interest until 2024-2025? So what's getting distributed today are the interests on the ones bought 1-3 years ago (and I presume at a much lower rate)? So to mimic buying the 1-3 year treasuries directly, you'd really have to be holding SHY for 1-3 years as well?","Mental Accounting, Framing Effect, Loss Aversion","The user's statement reveals a few biases.

https://stocks.apple.com/AUAwVZVNpRGevheV6PHfQjA

Can someone ELI5: 
But as central banks such as the Federal Reserve engage in one of the biggest interest-rate-hike campaigns in decades, demand for U.S. government bonds already in circulation has fallen in part because most of that debt carries lower interest rates than the bonds being issued today. That could mean a glut of cheap, low-yielding debt with few buyers.
Thereâ€™s been no emergency thus far, but the market for Treasury bonds is drawing increased attention out of concern that as liquidity dries up across the globe, there may at some point not be enough buyers of debt issued by the U.S. government. 
...
â€œIf we were to have a buyersâ€™ strike, or a failed series of Treasury auctions, 


I don't understand this. The first part, is this like the price of bonds in the secondary going to zero? (I'm [probably] exaggerating because the yield would then be infinite.) And (second part) if rates are going up, how would you have failed treasury auctions?  I would think that people (or countries, if we're talking on the massive scale) would be buying these, since these are new issues (as opposed to buying on the secondary market ones issued a year ago ). 

More questions I don't even know how to articulate.","Loss Aversion, Overconfidence, Anchoring","The user's confusion and questions about the Treasury bond market suggest that they are struggling to understand the implications of rising interest rates on bond prices and auctions. Their exaggeration of the potential price of bonds going to zero and the resulting infinite yield indicates a lack of clarity on the topic. Furthermore, their assumption that people would be buying new issues of Treasury bonds at higher rates, as opposed to older bonds with lower rates, shows a potential anchoring bias to their understanding of how bond markets work. Additionally, their inability to articulate their questions and their self-described confusion (""I don't understand this"") may indicate a loss aversion bias, as they may be hesitant to take on the risk of being wrong or not understanding the complex topic.

z4qckn,lljc00,"Buy house all cash? Cash out refi to invest in stocks?

First, let me start by just saying this is for discussion purposes.  So hear me out before you just answer with a ""no"".  Also, assume this is when interest rates are stable and neither too high nor too low.  I guess we can use 5-6% since that is historically a comfortable rate I think many can't argue too much with.

Whenever someone asks ""Should I cash out the equity in my house to invest in stocks"" the answer is a very scolding ""No!""  Security of paid off house, blah, blah.  

On the other hand if someone took 90% of their life savings and bought a house all cash (leaving 10% for repairs and emergencies and what not"", that would be also ""Stupid"".  Leverage, historical investment returns 7% &gt; appreciation \~5%, blah, blah.

So say you have $500k (after taxes on any gains, of course, and say this is in your non-retirement accounts, where the size of your retirement accounts are just OK, call it 80% of ideal for your age), and a house you want to buy is $450k.  Let's say it's a couple of weeks ago, and borrowing rates were &gt;7%.  And you think, well, that sucks (imagine how much that would suck if rates were 14%+ like in the 70's).  Do you just buy the house outright with $450k?  But then you have pretty much no money left invested to grow.  But you have all this equity in the house.  So say rates drop to 4-5%.  Do you cash out some of that and invest in stocks?  

Is there really any difference between 

* Paying all cash initially and then cashing out to invest in stocks 
* Leaving most cash in stocks and taking on debt

The end result is sort of the same, just different steps to get there as well as the psychological ""bird in the hand"" of a fully-paid house and then subsequently going into debt.  Let's ignore taxes for this discussion (say mortgage interest deduction doesn't provide much benefit over standard deduction).

(I know there's probably a timing aspect to consider because if rates were 7%+ today, they probably aren't dropping to 4% next month.  Tho, what if they did?)

Neither extreme (all-cash 0% financed vs no-down 100% financed) is ideal.  But where is the line?  Is it a line that changes as you age?  Does it change based on interest rates?  Does it change when the $ is higher and mortgage interest deduction comes back into play?","Framing Effect, Mental Accounting","The user's statement exhibits the Framing Effect bias as they are trying to frame the decision of whether to pay all cash for a house or take on debt to invest in stocks in different ways, essentially arguing that the end result is the same regardless of the initial decision.

I'm 37 and my wife is 43. This is the first year where we made too much to contribute to roth IRAs or get tax break for trad IRA contributions, but I expect that to continue for the foreseeable future.

I am maxing out 401k w/match. Wife is self employed and has traditional IRA.

I'm thinking that since she is older than me, but I am the primary earner, it would make sense for us to do traditional to roth conversion each year for her, so that we would have access to tax-free growth when she is 59.5 . I am hoping to retire early, so that would make some retirement money available to us sooner, then when I turn 59.5 we would have access to my 401k.

&amp;#x200B;

Does this make sense? My plan would be to do trad IRA contribution and immediately convert to Roth to avoid any capital gains taxes. We would leave her existing traditional IRA as it is, and open a new one for the sole purpose of the conversions.

m7ggoh,locusofself,"Backdoor Roth IRA and ""pro rata"" rule question

Greetings PF!

Wife has traditional IRA \~$50k. The balance is completely from deductible contributions and their growth.

I am considering a Roth conversion for her. As of 2020 filing we arent eligible for Roth, or Trad deductions.

My understanding (?) is that if I convert the whole thing, it will add the entire balance to our 2021 taxable income. So if our *effective* 2021 tax rate is say 20% , we would owe 10k additional tax next year. 

The tax bill sounds bad, but if this really opens the door to being able to do more back door roth contributions for her each year, this seems like a good idea, especially because I am the higher earner, but she is 6 years older than me, and will be 59.5  in  16.5 years, and I want to retire early.

So provided we stay married forever, it kindof feels like if I pay the $10k to convert to Roth, we can subsequently use the Roth IRA as a tax advantaged account (through conversions) with a 16.5 year time horizon.

Then if I am able to retire at 53, we can start dipping into that,  then later my 401k and my Roth.

Am I understanding this ""pro rata"" rule, that it would just be a 1-time big tax bill for the conversion, but then when we both have only Roth IRAs, we can do backdoor contributions without any further taxes imposed?

&amp;#x200B;

EDIT: Several have pointed out because my wife is self-employed, she can open a solo 401k and roll the IRA into that, then we won't have to deal with the pro rata rule for roth conversions.  Also, that will sortof make the roth conversion thing moot anyways, because she could do Roth 401k and Trad 401k contributions.

The cabin would be approximately $1000 all in a month. So my total bills with the cabin would be around $2500 (plus or minus). After the duplex rent we would be down to $1400 out of pocket bills.

kdt9yi,mado0801,"Should I spend 28k on a car?

Hey guys I recently quit my job and Iâ€™ll be receiving a severance for 4 months which will amount to about 2400 a month. To give you some background, Iâ€™m debt free, own a duplex which I rent out half and get a rent payment of about 1100. My mortgage payment is around 715. After all my bills and food is paid my total expenses for the month is around $200, after the rent payment. I have 57k in retirement, 17k in stock portfolio, 44k in another brokerage and 28k in saving of which 10k is my emergency since my expenses are so low. Iâ€™m 30yr old. 

I want to buy a 1995 Ford bronco to convert into a camper and go travel in us for the next four months. The car is around 28k and Iâ€™d put about 3k into it and pay cash for all of it. 

Broncos have really good resale so Iâ€™d prob keep it or maybe just resell when I get back from the trip. 

Iâ€™m really good with money and investing so my only hesitation is that I wouldnâ€™t be able to invest as much when Iâ€™m traveling, however I also wouldnâ€™t be digging into savings as Iâ€™d get the money from my rental. Also wouldnâ€™t have a job when I get back but I can easily survive considering my expenses are so low. Iâ€™m kind of thinking of this as a once in a lifetime chance to get paid and have 4 months off however the upfront cost is keeping me.

Hi all, Iâ€™ll make it short. I own a duplex and rent the other half. Current mortgage payment is $715 on a 30 yr 3.99% refinanced last year.

kth04y,mado0801,"Tell me how much I should have for an emergency fund

Hello Guys, 

I wanted to get your opinion because I have a bit of a unique situation. I current own a duplex which I house hack and my current mortgage is 715 a month and the rental I receive is 1100 a month. I'm a frugal/investing nut case HAHA so my finances are dialed in. My tenant has proven to be very reliable over the years and has a stable job. My total bills per month are around 1315, so minus the rental income it comes to about 215 per month out of my pocket. As you can see I save a considerable amount of my income each year. I'm 30 single, no kids. Net worth of around 325k. No debt other than the mortgage. 

I am having a really hard time holding an emergency fund of, typically 20k in a high interest saving account (high interest my a\*\*) current rates around .4% (BS). I want to put 15k of this into the market. 

So this would leave me with 5k emergency fund. My car is good to go, my house does not have any known problems. My risk tolerance is high due to my age, net worth and monthly expenses. 

With my current situation and the current economic climate, do you think this is a good idea?

lghoiz,mado0801,"Should I pay off my house?

Hi Guys,

A little background - Im 30 yr single male with a duplex I rent out. I rent the second half for $1100 a month. My mortgage payment is $715 on a 3.99% apr 30 yr fixed. My other bills are really low so I spend about $450 on top of the $385 I cash flow on the rental. Living free obviously. Total bills $785.

I owe 87k on this house - its worth around 275k. I have 87k in a taxable brokerage account. This is outside of my retirement. I have about $72k in retirement currently.

**\*\*should I pay off the mortgage or should I keep the money invested\*\*** I understand the mathematical upside of keeping it invested, but there is something appealing about paying it off. So i guess i'm just searching for your opinions.

Originally, I was going to use that 87k for another house for my self and rent out the duplex both units, but with the real estate market the way it is I plan to wait. So i figure I can save money much faster when its paid off.

Essentially, if its paid off my total monthly bills would be about 1150. So only $50 out of my pocket and I can bank 100% of my w2.

o2dmfe,mado0801,"Need help deciding whether to sell my rental property or not.

Hi random strangers! I need some unbiased help. Please be as honest as you'd like. 

Back story - I'm 31 yr old, male, single, make 57k a year, I work from home, net worth 325k, 150k in home equity, 78k in retirement, 100k in taxable brokerage. The house I own is a duplex worth $250k. I inherited it two years ago and have been renting the other unit ever since. The house is in a good area, but its more for families and I dont fit in. Dating is hard because its further away (its in the suburbs) and I want to start dating more. 

My mortgage payment is $715 PITI a month and i bring in $1150 in rent per month. So i live for free and cash flow so, so you can see its a good thing going, however I hate being a landlord and I hate even more being a landlord with my renter downstairs. Also, the property was built in 1890 so lots of issues. My original plan was to live here for a few years to save money for a down payment of another house and then I'd move into that house and rent this full duplex.. I have enough money for a down payment now. If I did that, I could pay for my new house and the duplex mortgage with the rent from the renters. So on the surface it seems like a good idea. I could build wealth at a good rate. However, I do not make a ton of salary so there is a good amount of risk in this. 

**So i have been debating a few options - its been in my mind so much** 

\- Sell this duplex and use the equity and brokerage money to buy a house cash (be the happiest - less risky, however not able to build the most wealth)

\- Keep the duplex, buy another house and rent the entire duplex (make the most money long term - most stress)

\- Sell the duplex, use the equity to invest and just rent for awhile

&amp;#x200B;

I think my biggest problem is I stress over the rental and what may go wrong, what if the renter leaves, blah blah blah. I've been told I over think things a lot. I just see buying my own house to be such a stress reliever, however I am a super saver so optimizing money and making more is important to me. I think selling the duplex could allow me to relieve some stress to find other ways to make more money in other ways. 

What do you guys think? Any advice? Anyone been through anything similar?
