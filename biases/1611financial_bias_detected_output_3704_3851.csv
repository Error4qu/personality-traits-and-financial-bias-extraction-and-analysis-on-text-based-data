rxjsyu,MichaelMidnight,"Starting 2022: Putting Money In Both Roth IRA And Crypto OR Roth IRA Only

Hi all! So I'm starting the year fresh and my original plan was to add some money towards my 2022 Roth IRA and add some monies toward Bit Coin and Ethereum (dollar cost averaging and all that but my Roth IRA getting the lion's share of my investments) and be balanced and well rounded. But now when I'm thinking of the long LONG term, I don't know if I'm better served by reallocating the funds I was going to put towards crypto towards my Roth IRA first.

q07shg,Missing_Back,"Use a credit card to build credit vs co-signing?

Discussion with my parents (obviously Iâ€™m an adult and they have no say as to whether or not I get a credit card but itâ€™s just something we talk about):Iâ€™m 22, in college, focusing hard on school and other field related learning, I make $50 a week and save 50% of it (not a legit job, just mowing lawns). I have decent money habits, but to be fair, I also have very little responsibility (I worked a job in high school, spent most of what I earned, and I learned a very important lesson from it). I donâ€™t spend money mindlessly, I go through my checking my and savings every week to be conscious of my money going in and out, like I said transfer 50% of the little bit of money I make every week into savings.

 I think getting a credit card would be wise because it can help me build my credit which as I understand is a beneficial thing. Helps later on with loans (car, house, etc). This is things Iâ€™ve heard from different sources, and it seems wise. Although I admit I donâ€™t have as well rounded understanding as I could or should. Hence posts like this. 

My parents used credit cards very poorly in their early adulthood, and have been credit card free for 24 years after getting out of that hole. They have house and car loans, but never credit cards. Both of my older brothers have credit card debt. 

My parents say I donâ€™t need to worry about credit. I wonâ€™t need credit score because theyâ€™ll co-sign on my first apartment and whatnot, and a credit card wonâ€™t make much of a difference anyways as far as my credit score goes. 

So the question that my mom was wondering, (although Iâ€™m wondering about credit cards in general, not specific to apartments) is â€œwhatâ€™s wiser? Getting a credit card to just build credit as I still live at home, or not worrying about that crap and just let my parents co sign?â€

* I have roughly $2k in HSA, which I am rolling over to Fidelity's HSA account. My new company doesn't have an HSA health plan, so from my understanding, I cannot contribute to an HSA plan and rather get it under one umbrella with Fidelity. 
* I max out my Roth IRA every year with Fidelity - $500 each month
* I currently own a home, so paying a $1350 mortgage 
* Have 6 months emergency fund in an HYSA - and do contribute to that with each paycheck 
* I have money in Crypto and ETFs and contribute the majority of my money after paying bills at the end of the month (I live a frugal life).

Hey all,
Needing some help/advice and feedback -

Coming into the new year, making some shifts and adjustments to my investing. 

Recently sold my home and made money and purchased a new home with my significant other. So right now, sitting on a pile of cash. 

Any help/advice would be grateful. 

Current investments: 

Roth IRA - With Fidelity: FZROX and FZILX. 
- Currently sitting at $12k+
- I max this out every year.  
- Being an ROTH IRA, should I leave FZROX &amp; FZILX? I know itâ€™s not transferable but not looking to move. 

HSA - With Fidelity: FZROX - this past year I moved it to Fidelity to invest. 
- Currently sitting at $7k+
- Current company is rolling out a High Deductible plan + HSA, so planning on using that plan and maxing it out. 
- Now that my company is rolling out an HSA plan, can I just add to the Fidelity account? Or do I need to use their plan? 
- Is FZROX a smart play? Or should I get Vanguard ETFs so itâ€™s more transferable? 

401k - With Rivers Edge and now my company is moving to Vanguard. 
- Sitting around $108k
- Invested in 100% Schwab S&amp;P 500
- Since we are moving to Vanguard, planning on rolling over and putting it into VTI / VXUS or just VXUS. Does that split work for 401k?

Brokerage - was with Robinhood but liquidated everything when buying this new house. Planning on reinvesting into Fidelity for long term growth. 
- Will be investing around $150k in lump sum. 
- Sticking with Fidelity thinking with my HSA &amp; ROTH IRA will stay for the foreseeable future. 
- Still thinking long term so want ETFs or something similar. Since Iâ€™m doing Fidelity for the Brokerage, makes more sense to do a Vanguard ETF than a Fidelitys FZROX &amp; FZILX since those two you can transfer. 
- Would I get Fees / does it make sense to get Vanguard ETF - VTI / VXUS? 

Crypto - invest a little here and there in Crypto for high risk / high reward. Using Coinbase. 

Currently : 30 years old, no major debt (mortgage), making about $115k a year. 

Just want to make sure my investments are clear away from fees and since lots of the investments are using the same, does that make sense?

Beginning of the year on 1/2 I lump summed into my Roth IRA. At that point I was earning $90k base &amp; 40k commission (OTE of 130k). But since thatâ€™s under the 144k MAGI for Roth IRA, it didnâ€™t matter.

I'm reading a lot on backdoor Roth IRA and I want to be sure I'm getting this correct.

the 6 steps to do it

Step #1: Contribute to traditional IRA 

Step #2: Invest the money in a money market fund.

Step #3: Move money from traditional IRA to Roth IRA (i.e. a Roth conversion).

Step #4: Invest in your preferred investment in the Roth IRA

Step #5: Ensure you have no money in a traditional IRA, SEP-IRA, or SIMPLE IRA on December 31st

Step #6: Report the transactions correctly on your taxes by filling out Form 8606.

I then noticed our taxable income is at around 86.000, so around 5.000 dollars in the 22% taxbracket. I went and dumped in 5.000 in my Tradional IRA with fidelity, and amended my taxes in turbotax.

Turbo tax informs me i can only deduct a bit above 4000 due to AGI,. im fine with that lesson learned to doublecheck that for next yer. But after going through the amendments Turbotax still only show a return of 900 dollars in the ""top""

&amp;#x200B;

This leave me to believe one of the following

1: i have misunderstood a part the American tax bracket and Trad IRA deductions.

2: TurboTax does not update the return amount on amendments

Anyone that can confirm what I'm missing here ?

u9y7tr,Money_Maketh_Man,"Done with the flowChart. now what ?

So I started reading this reddit a few years ago and im thankful for what I've learned it has been a huge benefit in me understanding the American system as an immigrant.

in those years Creditreport for both me and my US wife has been drastically improved and we run at an \~800 pts score , while small time churning CC and bank accounts.

Debt has been reduced so its only mortgagde and one car that has a loan on them both are below the 3% interest rates

I've followed the flowchart but it ends with  Cap out 401k. which we started last year and so far on this year are 100% on track to do.

But what is next ?

&amp;#x200B;

This year i dont se us being able to do Traditional Roth contributions with deductions So most likely i need to read up more on the backdoor Roth IRA.

Despite capping starting with maxing out our 401k our savings account are still slowly rising.. for last year taxes i use the growth for an Tradional IRA contribution but our income will be slightly higher this year and maybe a bit more higher (I might be getting a new job offer here soon)

Yesterday I called them. They tell me it due to the name issue (Chase is in the new last name and Citi is still in the old lastname) and they would need to look into it and get back to me in 24 hours. did not get a call back

Today we called 6 times to their support. they verified they have received the papers back and the name has been added to the account but the account is not under that name ( yeah im confused as well)  


during all of the 6 calls (2 which  we actually got a supervisor on) we where put on hold and after 10 min of hold the phone system kicked us off

3 chat attempts was tried but they just tell us to call despite mentioned that we can maintain a call as the system kicks us out after 10 mins of hold time.

at one point the chat person just had us sitting and waiting 30 mins without a response or even acknowledgment of what was written until I close it out.

Right now (age 30), I make roughly $58,000 a year before taxes with an extra $6,000 from a side-job. With this, I make in total of $64,000 a year. My total investments monthly include: 

$600 a month personal stocks (VTSAX), $541 a month in Roth IRA (VTI), $262 a month Roth 401k, and $262 a month Roth 401k Match. With this, I am putting away roughly $1665 a month into these investments (A little under 40% of my income). 

In total my investments are around $5000 in Roth 401k, $48,000 in stocks (VOO), and $29,000 in VTI Roth IRA (which I will invest $6,500 at the start of the year). 

My overall expenses are pretty small. I have an escrowed mortgage of roughly $1000. Next biggest expenses are food at $250 and $250 in unknown emergencies (car troubles, house problems, doctor visits, etc.). Then there are small charges here and there that equate to about $800 in total (gasoline, television, internet, gym, etc.). In total, I am spending a little less than I am making including everything. The extra money either goes into an emergency fund or small leisure activities.

In-terms of miles, I have put on 7,000 in the Honda. 25,000 in the Toyota, and 500 on the Ford. I travel and get paid mileage for my full-time as well. So, in about 1.5 years my mileage is 32,000 with mileage reimbursement from work roughly $2,500.

Unfortunately my $4,000 Honda broke down while Door dashing beyond repair. I have made in tot $7,500 Doordashing/Grubhub. Is this even worth it? I feel like I am wasting my time now that a vehicle has broken down and I will only get $700 for it.

What do you guys think of Doordash/Grubhub as side hustle? Gas is around 3.10. Should I buy an electric car, cheapo, new car, or give up on the side hustle?","Sunk Cost Fallacy, Loss Aversion, Mental Accounting","The user is exhibiting the Sunk Cost Fallacy by considering the $6,500 spent on the three vehicles when deciding whether to continue the side hustle, rather than focusing on the future costs and benefits. The user is also showing Loss Aversion by feeling the pain of losing $4,000 on the Honda that broke down, which is influencing their decision to continue or stop the side hustle. Additionally, the user is engaging in Mental Accounting by separating the costs and benefits of the side hustle into different mental accounts (e.g., the cost of the vehicles, the mileage reimbursement, and the income from Doordashing/Grubhub), which may lead to an inaccurate assessment of the overall profitability of the side hustle.","The user is allowing past investments and losses to cloud their judgment, leading to an overly pessimistic assessment of the side hustle's worth."

About me:
I am a 29 year old trying to do my best to retire early in the future (sense of freedom, not retirement). I make roughly $52,000 a year before including taxes. I have two side jobs that both generate roughly $6,000 a year. In 4 months, I will be eligible for military $0 down on a house with no PMI. Is it a good option to buy another cute/nice house and rent it out? Another source of income? Or does this sound like a bad idea?

Let me know if I need to add additional information!","Overconfidence, Framing Effect, Mental Accounting","The individual is considering purchasing a second home to rent it out, which could be a viable investment strategy. However, the statement reveals potential biases. The individual is enthusiastic about the prospect of buying another ""cute/nice house"" and framing it as ""another source of income,"" which indicates a positive emotional association with the investment, characteristic of the Framing Effect. Moreover, the individual is mentally accounting for the potential rental income as a separate entity, potentially ignoring the overall impact on their financial situation, indicative of Mental Accounting. The individual's confidence in their ability to retire early and their consideration of taking on a new investment, despite having a relatively modest income and existing debts, suggests Overconfidence in their financial decision-making abilities.",The individual exhibits a tendency to make financial decisions driven by overly optimistic expectations and a failure to consider the broader implications of their investment choices.
r6xdec,Money_Tough,"Would It Make Financial Sense to Build Out My Basement and Rent The Upstairs?

I have a cute house that has two levels. The upstairs has a bedroom and half a bath. The first floor has two bedrooms, full bath, kitchen, and living room. Then there is a basement where one half is laundry and heating. On the other half is an empty, but decent sized area. 

Would it be worth my time to paint, put flooring in, pay for an egress, and pay for a bathroom? If I did this, I was thinking about renting the upstairs and living in the downstairs. Building a walkout egress would allow me to never have to see the tenets. Living in the new basement would allow me to verify they were not trashing the place. Thoughts? 

Only issue I see is the very small driveway. Might have to park somewhere else.","Mental Accounting, Sunk Cost Fallacy, Loss Aversion","The homeowner is considering a significant renovation project to rent out the upstairs and live in the downstairs. The presence of Mental Accounting is evident as the homeowner is mentally separating the potential rental income from the upstairs and their own living expenses on the downstairs, potentially treating the rental income as a separate account. The homeowner is also likely to be influenced by the Sunk Cost Fallacy, as they are considering investing a substantial amount of money in the renovation, which may lead them to continue investing even if the returns are not justified. Additionally, the homeowner's concern about the tenants ""trashing the place"" suggests Loss Aversion, as they are trying to mitigate potential losses by being able to monitor the tenants.",The homeowner's decision-making is influenced by biases that lead them to overemphasize potential benefits and underestimate potential costs and risks associated with the renovation and rental plans.

In this question, letâ€™s assume we are paying the minimum each month whether it was monthly. Bi-weekly, or weeklyâ€¦

Letâ€™s ignore the fact that there is an extra 4 weeks of payments if you go with either weekly plan. Would paying weekly/bi-weekly save you a significant amount of money over the long-run? I know it would save some of the incurring interest, but is it enough to be worth it?","Framing Effect, Mental Accounting","The user is framing the mortgage payment frequency as a potential savings opportunity, rather than simply considering the total annual payment amount. This framing effect is influencing their perception of the potential benefits of more frequent payments. Additionally, the user is mentally accounting for the interest savings as a separate entity, rather than considering the overall cost of the mortgage. This mental accounting is leading them to focus on the potential savings from more frequent payments, rather than the total cost.","The user is exhibiting a biased decision-making process by framing the mortgage payment frequency as a savings opportunity and mentally accounting for the interest savings, rather than considering the overall cost of the mortgage."
