obckre,y0ungprofessional,"Good time to ""downgrade"" my car?

I graduated last year and bought myself my first car last summer.  I wanted to treat myself since I graduated college debt-free, and got a pretty nice car for someone my age.  Shortly after buying it, I got more involved in the online finance communities and was kicking myself for not trying to get a more basic/inexpensive car.  Well, I'm thinking of ""downgrading"" my car now since the value of my car has gone up significantly, even though I put some mileage on it as well.

Yes, I know all cars have gone up in price and are going for sale at a premium these days.  However, my vehicle has gone up in value quite significantly (could possibly ""gain"" about $8k if I were able to sell by owner).  I feel like these are very strange times when it comes to the auto market (and a lot of things!), but if I were to find a decent used vehicle in the $8 to $12k range would this be a good option to pursue?  I am in the process of trying to save for my first investment property as well, so I think this would be a great opportunity to pull out some capital.

More background: just under $6k loan remaining, 50k mileage on the current vehicle, flexible with new car options (don't mind driving something lower quality than what I have - I feel spoiled now)","Loss Aversion, Mental Accounting, Sunk Cost Fallacy","The user's decision to consider ""downgrading"" their car is influenced by the fact that they feel they overpaid for the vehicle initially, and now see an opportunity to ""gain"" $8k by selling it. This is an example of Loss Aversion, as they are focusing on the potential loss (overpaying) rather than the actual value of the car. Additionally, the user is mentally accounting for the $8k gain as a separate entity, which they can use towards their goal of saving for an investment property, illustrating Mental Accounting. Furthermore, the user is still paying off a $6k loan on the vehicle, and selling the car would likely mean absorbing some loss or settling the loan, but they are not explicitly considering this cost in their decision, hinting at a potential Sunk Cost Fallacy if they were to proceed without properly accounting for the remaining loan.","The user is exhibiting biased decision-making behavior by focusing on perceived losses, mentally compartmentalizing potential gains, and potentially ignoring sunk costs in their consideration of ""downgrading"" their car."

In 2019, I started maxing out my Roth IRA during my last year of college

In 2020, I maxed out my Roth IRA + HSA my first half year working full time.

In 2021, I will come close to maxing out my $19,500 of 401k contributions in addition to my Roth IRA and HSA.

And in 2022â€¦I am hesitant to keep putting away $500 into my Roth IRA at the start of each month because Iâ€™m not sure where my MAGI will end up next year. I do a decent amount of gig work and have bonuses at work as well.  I donâ€™t believe my 401k plan at work allows me to do backdooring over the $19,500 limit - this is something that Iâ€™d really like to do though.

(1) Should I wait to see how much I contribute to my Roth IRA until tax season of next year (start of 2023)? I am thinking of keeping funds in my high interest yielding stable coin account, paying ~8%, in the meantime.

(2) I am going to reach out to the 401k administrator to see if I can contribute more than the limit - but I work at a smaller firm and donâ€™t think it is allowed. Should I start an after tax brokerage account?

The hesitation to continue contributing $500 to their Roth IRA due to uncertainty about their Modified Adjusted Gross Income (MAGI) next year indicates Loss Aversion, as they are weighing the potential loss of exceeding the limit against the gain of continuing to save. The consideration of waiting until tax season to assess their Roth IRA contributions also suggests Status Quo Bias, as they are inclined to maintain their current situation rather than making a decision now. Furthermore, the user's goal of reaching a net worth of $100k+ by a specific deadline and their confidence in achieving it may be Anchored on the previous year's progress, demonstrating Anchoring bias.","The user exhibits a cautious and indecisive behavior, hesitant to make decisions due to uncertainty and anchored on past progress, while also being inclined to maintain the status quo."

Hey all,

This might be a silly (or legit) concern but I am unsure about making extra payments on my car loan despite having the extra income to do so. I bought the car brand new (don't throw stones at me) - it's a 2019 Toyota RAV4 - and I love it. My goal from the get-go was to pay it off and keep driving it for 15-20+ years. Total amount financed was $30k but I'm down to $23k now. I wanted to buy it used but I fell in love with the new body style and have never been a fan of the old body style. Also, RAV4's hold their resale value really well so I'm not sure if I'm buying a one year used model would have made a huge difference.

I have the ability to make extra payments to the car loan every week (side hustle) but I'm paranoid to do so because I will not have equity in the car for the first year. I'd prefer the GAP insurance to pay for the difference in case the car was to get totaled instead of me footing the bill in the forms of extra payments. Is this a silly or valid concern? Ultimately, should I keep making extra payments and try to pay it off ASAP? The interest rate is 3.9%.

The user is estimating their taxes to be around $9k based on their taxable income of $83k, which suggests they are using a mental model or rule of thumb to estimate their tax liability. However, when they find out they owe more in taxes, they are confused and attribute it to having ""too many withholdings for every paycheck.""
