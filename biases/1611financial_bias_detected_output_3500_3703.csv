oh0mmy,mado0801,"Am I in good shape to live this lifestyle?

Hello, 

I'm trying to figure out if this is a good idea. 

Back story - Single. male, 31 yr old, work from home, make 60k a year, 250k in an investment account, 80k in retirement, 7k in emergency fund, saving 30% gross toward Roth, HSA and 401k. I own a duplex and rent the other side out. I live for free and cash flow about $400 a month. I plan to sell this house. 

I hate owning real estate and want to have a more adventure filled life style and do not want to be a long distance landlord. I do not know where I want to live so this is a way I can test the waters cheaply. My plan is to convert a van into a full time living space. I understand the pros and con, this post is not about that. I'd say ill prob spend at least 2 years if not more living in the van. The van will cost me around 65k paid cash and I will build out myself in the next few months. The conversion will run approx. 15 to 20k and I will cash flow throughout the build. I know there are cheaper ways to do this, but this is what I want. I will still be working full time and investing and living for free while building and travelling. A big concern is that the van will likely depreciate, however my rational is that the difference from what I buy the van to what I eventually sell it at will be what the memories are worth to me. 

Please let me know your thoughts, points of view or anything you'd like to share. Thanks and have a great day!","Mental Accounting, Sunk Cost Fallacy, Affect Heuristic","The individual exhibits Mental Accounting by assigning a specific value to the depreciation of the van, equating it to the ""worth"" of memories. This separate mental account for the van's depreciation allows him to justify the expense. Additionally, the statement ""the difference from what I buy the van to what I eventually sell it at will be what the memories are worth to me"" suggests a potential Sunk Cost Fallacy, as he may be planning to hold onto the van due to the resources already invested, even if it no longer makes financial sense.

oo20xa,mado0801,"Real estate tax question

I was hoping you could assist with a tax question regarding my rental property. I'm looking to sell a property (duplex) I inherited in Dec 2018. I rented both units from March 2019 until Jan 1st 2020. I moved into the other unit Jan 1st 2020 and continued to rent the second unit, which is still rented. I'm still living here as well. I refinanced the property in Feb 2020 as a primary residence. 

The realtor says I can list for $250k to $275k. I owe $86k. When my family member passed I got an appraisal at time of death, which was appraised for $195k. 

I'm hoping you all can assist me with explaining how I can sell this property the most tax efficient way. From my understanding, if you live in the property for 2 years you can have a gain of $250k tax free as a single person.

oo82q0,mado0801,"What are the negatives to my plan?

Hi everyone, 

I inherited a duplex 2 years ago. I refinanced and its now in my name with a low rate. I live in the top unit (could rent for $900) and I current do rent the bottom at a monthly rent of $1150. The monthly payment (with insurance and taxes included) is $700 a month. I owe 86k and its worth approximately 270k. I like real estate and the cash flow on the property is good and my personal investment is basically nothing aside from some renovations ive done totaling around $8k. The area is in an up and coming area with large investments in building and infrastructure. So I could see appreciation being higher than the norm. 

However, I do not want to live here. Instead I want to buy a single family house for myself and keep this rental and rent both sides. The house I would buy is approximately $250k-$275k. I have 65k for 20% down and 10k for closing costs. In addition, I have 80k in retirement, 20k in emergency fund and 15k in an investment account. I'm 31 yrs old and make 57k a year. I have no debt other than the mortgage stated above.

If I buy this single family house, my monthly bills will be $2700, including both mortgages. With the total of $2050 coming in from rent, my monthly bills will be reduced to $650. 

Do you guys think I am okay to make this move? If not, what should I do to improve? I understand the risks involved (tenant not paying, destroying property, etc.) but in my mind its a risk im willing to take in order to move out of the current duplex.

Hello, 

I am 31 yrs old. Single. Make 57k per year. Have 275k in brokerage account. 80k in retirement. 20k in emergency fund. Currently save about $2200 a month (retirement and in brokerage account)

I want to buy a house worth approximately 275k - it may take a few months so in those few months I'll save for the closing costs to pay cash either way. 

My question is should sell the investments in my brokerage account to pay cash for the house? Or should I only put 20% down, which would leave me with about 210k in the brokerage account. If I pay cash - house payment would be $350 (taxes and insurance) if I dont pay cash payment would be about $1200  (about 25% of my gross). 

If I pay cash, savings rate is higher but initial investments much lower. Plus rates are so low. I've ran the numbers and in the long run paying only 20% will allow me to accumulate much more money. I understand not paying cash is taking on more risk.

I want to start investing into the S&amp;P500 and saw this index fund from Amundi. I noticed that it beats the actual index by a lot. I understand there are differences in performance due to replication, costs, etc. But this seems unusual. Notice the 1Y performance difference.

Would it be a tax write off? 

Do I need a CPA or financial planner?

Between my partner and I, we make $140k. We would like to build our dream home but we have a few roadblocks to getting there and we are trying to figure out the best way to get there.

Breakdown: I have $125k in student loan debt, $18k remaining on our vehicle, my partner he has no debt. We have no other debts besides our home which we plan on selling once the dream home is built. We have no children. Our mortgage is paid monthly and we put out $770 in mandatory spending in addition to our mortgage, totaling $2,270.00. However, we only have $5k in savings, no 401k (which we are planning on maxing out each year since I just started working) and no other investments. We are learning how to change this, we have no outside help. When we put the house up for sale, we are estimating that we could make $120k-160 profit off of the sale of the house. We would like to start the build on the dream house in 3-4 years. Of course, the earlier the better. How can we achieve our dream faster?

No matter the plan we end up deciding on, we are going to max out our 401k. Question: Can 401k be combined? Are there ""additional"" benefits to combining spouse 401k or should they be kept separate for tax reasons?

Should we (in conjunction with maxing out the 401k):

A) Pay off the car first and then the student loans while saving money for the dream home? If so, while paying these things off, how much should we be putting away in savings?


B) Pay off the car, make the minimum payments on the student loans and put the rest of the money towards our dream home? The student loan payments would last longer in this scenario. 

C) Have my partner pay into the 401 independently for sometime while also putting money into savings. I pay the car off and put all of my money towards my student loans ($5k a month) and pay off the student loans in 25 months? And then we both tackle the 401k to max out and then combined we can put away about $7k a month after taxes.

We need to move but the cost of buying a house is so insane right now. This leads me to my dilemma. We were planning on building our dream home in a few years (estimate of $500k, no more) but need to move from our current home because of the influx of crime. It is no longer a matter of ""if"" but a matter of ""when"" we will become the victim of crime. We were trying to hold out as long as we could because our mortgage right now is $1100. Unfortunately we are going to have to move and so we are planning on putting the house up for sale over the summer, we should be able to make $100k off of our home. We spent the weekend looking at homes and a decent home in any area costs about $350k and up. The housing market is insane right now so I won't go into detail about that.

We have no CC debt, only my student loans and one car payment, nothing else. We will have $50k in savings by the time we put the house up for sale this summer, no kids, and with the sell of the home, we could easily have $100k so $150k total. We discussed putting the $100k into the next home but I've been debating if we should just go ahead and have the dream house built and put the $100k towards that or keep it and invest it and eventually put the next home up for sale while we continue to save money? Financially, what would be the best move? We will be using a the VA home loan so we would not need a down payment. 

I feel like, since the cost of a decent home is $350k and we are going to take out a loan anyway, that we mine as well get the dream house built now because we would be more than halfway there with a loan that high with a home we don't really want. 

I'd like to make the best financially smart move here. We aren't sure what goes into building a home but I'm sure it can get expensive pretty quick. I just want to make the right decision here.

Hello everyone!

I left my employer and I am now trying to figure out what to do with the funds from my 401k. I know I need to roll them over but I don't know how (this is my first time) I should go about it. Currently I have $4211.xx in my Roth IRA with VTSAX. I have a brokerage account and traditional IRA, both of these accounts have a zero balance at Vanguard.

vhf0ov,Maxine_Shaw,"Student Loans vs Life

I'd like some input but I ""think"" I know what to do.

I (31F) have $125k in student loan debt. My biggest headache of it comes from two loans from grad programs, one $25k and the other $20k. The one with $25k has the highest interest and I plan on tackling this first and then the other $20k. After this the loan balances range from $7k to - $2k and I'll be able to breathe easier. The interest is small on the remaining loans so I'm not entirely worried about them but will pay them off as quickly as possible.

Debts: None besides student loans and mortgage.

Monthly expenses: $1500 for bills and food (mainly food, used to cost $600 now its up to $1000 and we eat at home). VA income $1650, mortgage $2100. Spouse $4k monthly. 

I'd like to put away all of my checks from my job once I start working, saving $5k to pay off the $25k loan when my student loan payments begin in October. I can do it, I'd be sacrificing living but at this point it's worth it.

Retirement accounts: Roth IRA $4k. I just started being able to save for retirement in April. $3k in savings after house emergency costing $15k.

Job: Start date is next month, $90k a year. 401k option is available though I am not sure when I can begin to participate. I will find out.

My situation: I am in the healthcare field, work is steady and bad employers are rapidly spreading. I'm in the process of opening my own practice and have a growing waitlist of clients and people that would love to work for me. I'm hoping to keep the job I landed for a minimum of 6 months but would prefer a year to save additional money for the business and try to pay off the loans. I'd like to work my job and continue to grow my practice until I am too busy to work my normal job.

Since the remaining loans are smaller in interest I am planning to pay them off once I am more financially secure (basically when ny practice is steady). 

Tax deductions: Besides the 401k is there anything I could do to lower my taxable income? I don't have any dependents. Can I put two dependents on my w-4 for my employer to get more of my money upfront and then pay the tax bill later? I'd be okay with this as long as I can pay off the high interest loan. It has gained almost $5k in interest since I got it a few years ago. 

My questions/concerns:

Is this a good plan? Does it seem too extreme? Should I put money back into thr emergency fund when I start working? Would investing help me pay off the loans quicker? Should I contribute to my 401k while I am trying to pay off the $25k loan?

Now that I've paid off some debt and rebuilt my emergency funds, my mind is back on how to build my wealth/passive income as much as possible so one day, sooner than later, will not need my job, although I may still choose to work if I want to.

Our 401k match is 50% for every dollar up to the limit and the Employee Stock Purchase Plan is a 10% look back provision (company is a blue chip teach stock) using up to 15% of each paycheck.

15d2xew,MediumBug8921,"Retirement Goal to CoastFi @50

I find it funny how we work so hard in life and most people believe with 15% of your income in retirement accounts you can retire at 65 and be comfortable. 

I mean youâ€™d be living modestly and not out there traveling like you should during the last 20-30 years of your life. But what if I donâ€™t want that? I just recently got involved with my investment journey and have asked ALOT of questions just to come to the following conclusion:

1. Work as hard as you can to achieve as much as you can contribute to your retirement accounts without sacrificing your â€œfun moneyâ€ or your sinking fund money. Itâ€™s possible but you just need to work harder.

2. To give more in a retirement account but not sacrifice other line items on your budget, you gotta work 2-3x as hard. Whether it be side hustles, real estate, a small portion of your income going to a brokerage account - youâ€™re young and can do it.

3. Worse case scenario if I canâ€™t contribute more than 15% (which is highly unlikely cuz as time goes on and education grows, you can negotiate pay rates and/or find freelance jobs/side hustles to benefit in your favor) I can always live frugally as I learned to live from birth to 21 when I got my first job. Itâ€™s not hard, itâ€™s just boring.

4. No one is gonna fund your retirement and no one is gonna help you. Youâ€™re in charge of your own way to grow your investments whether itâ€™s boglehead, Dave Ramsey or Robert Kiyosaki methodology (I know thereâ€™s plenty more out there). 

Itâ€™s just hard to achieve these goals just for 30-40 years of life when youâ€™re not even if youâ€™re prime. But whoâ€™s to say while youâ€™re in your prime at 30-40 you canâ€™t have a plethora of income-generating hacks.

I am in the final rounds of an interview process right now.

In my initial calls with the recruiter, I was told the specific salary which I pushed back on gently and they seemed to imply it's not really up for negotiation (at least at that stage). This is with a startup (so base + bonus + equity). Total comp is the same as I make now (but the base is higher with a lower bonus). It's a great company culture + benefits, but it would be hard to stomach taking a job without at least a 10% increase in my comp...especially when low comp is a reason I'm looking to leave.

I definitely see NYC as being my home base for the rest of my life. And the good renters' rights laws in NYC make renting not too bad... in general, you won't be dealing with some small-time landlord who doesn't let you hang things on the walls and harasses you constantly. 

But I have this weird feeling that if I don't own property, I will never be truly secure even if I build wealth in other ways. Or that in a place like NYC, the cost of rent will always go up a lot (unless you secure a stabilized apartment).

lrx23b,MichaelMidnight,"What's A Good Banking Setup For Savings, Checking, Investments, Etc: All-In-One Or Mixed

Hi Everyone, maybe someone can help me out in my pursuit or stir me right if I'm wrong. I want to park my money in 3 main places: Savings, Checking, and Investments. Right now I'm not worried about good APY %s, instead I'm more focused on having 3 individual buckets to transfers money quickly into and cash out also quickly in an emergency. And then of these three buckets, do I go all-in-one place (like Fidelity) or should I break it up according to the best place for each account (like Fidelity + Ally).

Hi all! I'm a little new to the stock market and I wanted to know if there's any benefit to having one singular Brokerage vs multiple.

Hi all, I was wondering if people here can give me their insights. Before the Pandemic I got the Plat card because of the great sign up bonus and because I was going to go to Japan in 1-3 years. Then Covid hit. I met my SUB of 100k MR points and travel is still so so and my Japan trip still all too early and preliminary. Right now I can use my MR points for purchases for 1:1 value.

Hi all, I thought I'd ask this question now that we're in the 2nd half of 2021. I'm not sure if any changes, big or small, has happened to each of these debit cards but I'm wondering what you all say is the better Debit Card for Int'l use and for returned ATM fees? I sort of remember the big differences was that Schwab does ATM fee returns at the end of the month while Fidelity does it daily. Also Schwab can withdraw $1000 vs $500 from Fidelity. But it's mostly about ATM processor fees like checking balance, etc that I'm not sure if one or both cover or don't.
