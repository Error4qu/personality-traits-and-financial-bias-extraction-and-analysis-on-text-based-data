105df9m,engineheat2,"newbie question on IRA and HSA

Hi,

Got 2 newbie questions...

1. I currently already max out the 401k my employer provides and I also have a Roth IRA account on Fidelity. I wonder if I'm also able to get another tax deferred IRA on my own. By tax deferred I mean you don't get taxed on it now, only when you withdraw after retirement, just like 401k.
2. I haven't contributed anything to HSA but I'm thinking about it. My original rationale is that I live a healthy lifestyle so I probably won't have much health related expenses. I also misunderstood it, thinking one can only use HSA funds for health related things. But now I learned that  you can also use HSA funds for non-health related things. This got me wondering, then wouldn't the money I put into a HSA now sort of act like an additional contribution like the 401k? As I understand, **after age 65,** one can use the HSA funds for non-health related things, it just has to be taxed like a 401k withdraw, but there's **no additional** penalties. So if I want to maximize my tax deferred retirement savings, I should contribute to a HSA as well.

Please advise.

11kil2f,engineheat2,"My lease is up in a few month. I'm not sure if I will stay in the area for another year. Advice?

My rent is 1400 and my lease is up in June. Due to career and personal reasons, I'm not sure I will spend another year in the area, so I'm excited about signing another year. It may very well be I need to move away 3 or 6 month after a new lease take effect, but I'm not sure. Breaking the lease has significant financial burdens and hassles.

I live in an apartment complex managed by a LLC. They do offer month to month after your first year, but that adds $200 per month to the rent. I'm really not too happy about that. I'm thinking about negotiating them to waive the extra $200 and let me go month to month when my lease is up, but I'm not sure if it's a good idea since I'm dealing with a management company as opposed to a sole owner.

If that fails, I'm thinking about finding short term options. But I don't want roommates, and if I were to  get my own place, I'm not sure if there are short term options that are cheaper than what I have (even with the extra $200).

I lost about $15k in 2022. 

People say it's going to be a volatile stock market in 2023 and it's ""hard"" for equities to beat alternatives like CDs or bonds. In fact, I have a lot of my non 401k cash in US Treasury bills now and CDs. I'm content with a 4.5% return this year if I can avoid the stock market volatility.

Specifically, I'm talking short term bonds (they do have a long term one too) I'm not really sure what are the underlying bonds in the funds, but they seem to benchmark with ""Bloomberg 1-3 Y Government/Credit TR"" or ""Bloomberg US Aggregate Bond TR"".

The ""standardized return %"" for a money market fund looks like this:

1-month: 0.37

I wonder if standardized return means the return % standardized to the time interval given. So if I look at the 1-month, that means whatever money 1 month ago has gone up by 0.37%. And with that, I can extrapolate what the annualized return would be by multiplying by 12 (assuming the same return, which is not realistic, but it does help one understand standardized return). Is that right? If so, I'm kind curious why the 1-month return is less than 1/3 of the 3-month return, given that interest rate has been rising and you'd think there be a greater return in more recent months.

The YTD is drastically less than the 3-month. Given that this figure was taken yesterday, it hasn't been 3 month into 2023 yet, but we are only 10 days away or so.

I'm single, in my 30s. My rent has gone from $1300 to $1500 and I got 3 month till my lease ends. I live in the Midwest and I'm deciding whether to buy a house or continue renting. The unique thing about me is that while I like the city I'm at, I do plan on spending 50% of my time else where. Currently, I'm trying to convince my employer to allow me to live a digital nomad lifestyle. They do have a policy that allows ""location free"" roles but I'm not sure they will grant it to me. It'll be a few month before I find a good opportunity to ask or get an answer on this. If they turn me down, I might need to look for another job which further complicates things. 

Anyway, I see a house that sells for $140k (HOA: $280 monthly, property tax: $1300 annual). I do have the savings to buy it with cash. Assuming I spend 50% of my time away:

Renting:  $1500 \* 12 = $18000 a year, with half of that or $9000 wasted if I'm not here.

Buying with cash: Lost interest income of roughly $7k annually assuming interest rate of 5%. $4660 goes to HOA and property tax. That brings the total cost to $11660, which is much lower than renting. 

Although there's a chance that property values can go down, people say it can't be more than 10%, this is not 2008, blah blah blah. Well, if I'm already saving $18000 - $11600 = $6400 in a year by buying,  In 2 years I would've saved enough to ""cover"" a 10% depreciation in property value, if it even happens that is. 

It's a 2 bedroom house so I might even rent out a room for, say, $900 a month and tell them they get to have the whole house to themselves for half the time.  That'll almost cover the $11600 in annual housing costs so I'll be living for free for the time that I'm in town.

At the time, there was an odor in the apartment and I thought it was paint and would dissipate quickly, since they tell me they paint each unit with each turnover. Upon moving in, the odor has not dissipated even after my attempts at airing it out. I contacted management and was told that it is due to the new carpet they installed. They offered to steam clean it which I accepted but it has not helped much. Now, two weeks later, the smell is still bothering me with no end in sight. I tried air purifiers with active carbon and it still doesn’t eliminate it completely. Moreover, with winter coming up, my ventilation options would be limited which would make it worse.

It might be that I’m more sensitive than most. But the smell is really bothering me and makes me uncomfortable. Home is a place I dread going back to. I really regret signing the lease but to terminate it, I’d lose on 2 months worth of rent. I wonder if I can try to negotiate with them to terminate the lease at a lower penalty? (say, 1 month), or have them refund me if they find a new tenant early. 

Yes, I understand I signed the lease and agreed to the clauses in it. I also understand my reason is probably not going to be accepted by the court. Life throws us curveballs and sometimes we just have to take the loss. But I feel it’s such a heavy penalty to charge a tenant 2 months worth of rent, and I heard in Ohio courts can sometimes make them refund you back some money if they are able to find a tenant sooner. Ideally I can just settle with them and get out. What’s your advice?

Thanks","Loss Aversion, Regret Aversion, Sunk Cost Fallacy","The individual in the statement is exhibiting Loss Aversion, as they are highly focused on minimizing the financial penalty associated with breaking the lease, indicating a strong aversion to loss. Regret Aversion is also present, as the person expresses regret over signing the lease and is seeking to mitigate this regret by negotiating a lower penalty. Furthermore, the Sunk Cost Fallacy is evident, as the individual is reluctant to ""waste"" the two months' worth of rent they would lose by breaking the lease, even though this cost is already incurred. The person's emphasis on trying to negotiate a lower penalty or having the landlord refund them if they find a new tenant early suggests that they are trying to recoup a loss that they perceive as significant.","The user tends to make decisions that are influenced by a desire to avoid losses and mitigate regret, often prioritizing short-term financial gains over adhering to previously made commitments."
17abczo,engineheat2,"Breaking a lease, did I just cost myself big?

I moved into an apt this month and discovered that it has an odor due to new carpet and makes me unwell. It's been weeks and it has not subsided. I contacted management and they steam cleaned it but it didn't help. Other tenants tells it took months for the odor to go away. I measured the VOC level and it's high.

I want to break my lease as I dread going to the apartment. Here's the lease clause:

EARLY TERMINATION. Provided there is no event of default by Resident under this Lease either at the time of exercise or on the date of early termination, Resident shall have the right to terminate this Lease prior to the Ending Date subject to the satisfaction of the following
conditions: (a) Resident shall provide written notice to Owner of its intent to exercise the early termination right not less than sixty (60) days prior
to the desired early termination date; and (b) at the time of providing such notice, Resident shall pay to Owner an early termination fee (the “Early
Termination Fee”) equal to the sum of: (i) all unpaid Rent then outstanding under this Lease; plus (ii) an amount equal to two hundred percent
(200%) of the current Monthly Rent. Upon satisfaction of the foregoing conditions, the date for early termination as set forth in Resident’s Termination Notice shall be deemed the Ending Date as set forth herein.

I understand it as even if I notify them tomorrow 10/18, I'd still need to pay rent till 12/18 due to the 60 day notice requirement and on top of that, 2 months worth of rent.

Is that correct? This is making me pretty depressed as I feel the fault is not 100% mine and it's a large chunk of money for a place I don't even want to live in anymore.

I know housing prices are at a all time high but so is rent and I'm tired of leases, moving.

I'm 38, single and lives in the Midwest. I make $140k and my current rent is about $1500. A starter condo in my area is about $200k, at around $170 to $200 per sqft. HOA runs about $250 per month and property tax is probably around $3k per year.

I got $150k saved in my 401k and I maximize my contribution to it along with HSA. Each month my take home is $6k and I save about $3500 after all expenses and so far I have around $330k saved and most of that is on Fidelity where a small portion is in Roth and most of it are in Treasury bills.

I'm deciding whether to buy a starter house next year (and possibly pay cash?) as opposed to renting and hoping the housing prices would drop, which many ppl say won't be for awhile.

Another option is to move in with a coworker of mine, who has offered me a master bedroom for $750 per month. That would obviously save me money, but I wonder if I can do better by buying a 2 bedroom condo for $200k and rent out a room myself?

I will be living in this city for the foreseeable future and I figure if I pay cash on a $200k condo and rent out a room for about $800 per month, that'll make up the lost interest I get from the Treasury bills, and then my expenses would be the taxes and HOAs and maybe some maintenance, which would be lower than the rent I pay now, and maybe even lower than if I moved in with my roommate.

Hey everyone, I am battling with whether I want to stay at my current job after I graduate or get a new one. 
For background- I will be attending a full online university for a bachelors in Finance, and would like to work while going to school to be able to pay for my school, and start saving for a down payment on a house. My parents have said that I can stay at home as long as possible

Job 1 (Current Job)- I work at a retail store making $15/hour and roughly get 10-15 hours per paycheck (I get paid every other week). It’s pretty easy, and I don’t have a set schedule so I would sometimes work mornings, some times I would work evenings. 

Job 2- This would be a bank teller position that I would receive through a connection I have as well as a business program I am involved in through my high school. I am almost guaranteed a job through this program. I would make $12/hour and get a guaranteed 40 hours per week as well as insurance, tuition reimbursement and stock options.

I don’t like my Mitsubishi truck and the dealership sold it to me AS IS. So I’m stuck with it I guess.
So I make 68k per year and out of impulse I bought a $18,988 Mitsubishi Outlander Sport SE truck 2020. Low mileage when I bought it 12,241 miles! Now it’s 13,124 miles. Pretty great on gas mileage I do have to say because of the automatic eco mode. 

Edit: Monthly payment is $409.06 and APR 9.45% 
Credit score is 758 since I made an early $1,000 payment Dec 21. If you see my old posts at first they tried to make my $1000 extend for 3 months so my next payment was in March at $227. But nope I called them up and told them that is for Dec month my next payment should be Jan 21. So now I’m back on schedule 

Anyways with taxes and dealership throwing gps/theft premium total is $20,588 I could’ve got something else but it had everything I wanted. I’ve been driving it for almost a month now. I checked kbb and my car is worth 17k. Each month my car is depreciating and I wanna sell it after it pay it off … 

Jan 10 will make a month and I’m already tired of the car. My first car payment is due Jan 21. I only have 16k in the bank, $3000 in my savings account and $1,000 in my 401k. 

I don’t like monthly car payments so my plan is to pay 3,000 each month until I get rid of this car loan. That’s 7 monthly payments. In July I will be done with my car payments.

I paid it toward the principal only balance, also cancelled my gap insurance and warranty. So now I only owe 13,800. And my interest is going up daily. $3.56 * 30 is how they calculate it. Not sure what they mean by this but my first actual car payment was Jan 21 and man they are me up interest. 

Just recently bought a crossover to travel to and from work. 50 miles a day is a lot and it has taken a toll on me mentally. Financially I can handle it. 13k left on my car note. My car insurance is a bit high. It’s $160 per month. My car note is $409 per month with a 9.45% APR. My credit is 758 but the dealership financed me with capital one. This was my mistake but I didn’t know. Just made my first payment and it was $455 and my interest was so high they took $287 and only $168 went toward my principal. 

I have a 2020 Mitsubishi Outlander Sport. I feel like I got hosed really bad but I needed a car so bad after I totaled my 2006 Honda Accord. 

Now I have a very personal decision to make and I need advice. 

Option 1: Sell my car to Carmax for 16-17k. I’ll only bring over like 3k in positive equity. So then I’ll pay cash for a 2014 Toyota Prius with 84k miles for $14,000. Title, doc fee and license plate transfer I feel like I’m looking at an additional +2k. But the car insurance will significantly go down $114. So I will be paying approximately $50-60. Not only that I will save so much money on gas too. It’s a 50mpg with 13 fuel tank. I would like to pay cash for the 2014 Toyota Prius but it seems like it’s a lot but I’m going to take it for a test drive 

Option 2: Trade in or sell my crossover for a 16-17k 2021 Toyota Corolla LE. Not sure how reliable it is but I’ll save $25 on car insurance. This will save a little on gas as it’s a 30/38 MPG. It’s better MPG than my crossover my crossover is 27/30 MPG. So my car insurance will be $135. Refinance at the same credit union at 6.99%

In all honesty I don’t like my crossover that much as the drivability is kind of bumpy and not as smooth. It has a CVT transmission FWD so that’s probably why? Option 1 and Option 2 also has a CVT transmission FWD and 1.8 4 Cylinder. At least the Mitsubishi has 2.0 4 Cylinder. That’s one factor that saves me on gas plus the eco mode.

The writer's justification for buying a new car with ""bells and whistles"" and considering it a good investment due to its potential resale value exemplifies the Sunk Cost Fallacy, as they are rationalizing a past expense. The writer's recent success in paying off the car loan and their current focus on investing in their 401k suggests Recency Bias, as they are prioritizing recent events over long-term considerations.

It feels great not to be in debt anymore! I paid off my loan fast to avoid being upside down! And hopefully I get a refund from the GPS / anti theft tracker as well as the camera they put as mandatory on my contract. My car insurance still high. They got me at $160 per month but I’m gonna trade it in soon. 

Officially a car owner y’all! Can’t wait to say officially a home owner ?? Ride this beauty for a few months and trade it in for something even better but a lesser car insurance payment. 

My question is do dealerships take cashier checks? I’m never financing anything ever in life again unless it’s 0% APR with no interest. Now that I have learned about banks, principal and equity I want to make certain I make the right move when it’s time to trade in my car. Sure it’s gonna be worth less but that’s what one should expect when driving anything off a lot. 

I want to trade it in for a Toyota XLE or Toyota SE with a sunroof. It can be a Honda Accord too with a sunroof.

11igqa1,ExplanationDazzling1,"Trade in - Kelly Blue Book and Carvana are offering me 18k for my Mitsubishi

Please tell me if this is a smart financial decision. My Mitsubishi Sport Outlander SE 2020 is fully paid off. The mileage is remarkable for the year it’s got less than 17,000 miles on it. I bought it Dec 10 with 12,240 miles on it. I paid the car off in full Feb 23. It also shows on my title. 

I had it for only 3 months and I paid it off. I paid $21,400 for it altogether. I liked it at first until I realized I would rather a more fuel efficient car and reliable car. I no longer want a cool looking sports car that drops value like a rock. What really grabbed my attention was the headlights and fog lights. I bought this crossover solely from emotion and pretty looks. I wasn’t thinking about gas mileage at the time. I later found out my mistubishi has a CVT transmission and every time I accelerate on the gas it sounds like a hungry, hungry hippo and then it goes away. The CarPlay is cool but my speaker could be better. The heated seats don’t stay hot for long.. and my heat could be better too. 

Fast forward I have the title for my crossover I just have to get the lien holder released from the title. So I’ll be going to the dmv soon. Afterwards I could trade my car in for something I like better and more fuel efficient. The current specs on my car:

Vin begins with J so I automatically thought it was reliable. J = Japan 

27 fuel economy 
24 city and 30 highway 

Car insurance: $171.00 ( I’m not sure why my insurance is so high for this vehicle) I didn’t know it was gonna be this high at the dealership 

I pay $40-50 each week for gas money so that’s $120 per month. My last billing statement from Sam’s Club was in Feb at $130 and Feb at $140

I want a more fuel efficient car with cheaper car insurance

On my mind I am looking at the 2016-2020 Toyota Yaris as an even trade with no down payment. The specs are phenomenal. 

Vin begins with 3. 3 = Mexico so this is reliable too

32/40 MPG City/Hwy

Transmission: Automatic ( It’s difficult to find cars with no CVT at a reasonable price these days)

Very clean title like my mistubishi. I do see it went to the auction but so did mine. 

Car insurance: If Mitsubishi Replaced my insurance states the following: 

Your 6-Month Policy Premium Will Decrease By
$117.20

Honestly feel like this credit union ripped off my mom. I never asked her about her savings until a few months ago just to make certain she is earning great money on her money. 


Story time:

My mother came across a $80,000 settlement and she put it at a credit union. They only have a 0.45% APY. After finding out her APY I was angry because she doesn’t know much about APY and HYSA! Now did my research and found out she can move it. She’s looking to move it to a CD at the same credit union. 

Now the APY is 4.15% and the APR is 4.05% 

How does APR work?? I wannna put her money in a savings account that she can gain more money. 

We just found out her retirement was in a IRA with a 0.45% interest rate too! She placed $1,000 back in the year of 2000 maybe 2001 in her IRA. So each month she gets $1.64.. in 1 year that’s  $19.68. She had her IRA for 21 years. 

In 21 years she only got $3,000. Someone please with financial knowledge let me know 

What is APR savings? I know APY is annual percentage yield and the higher the better the interest rate! But what is APR and why is it placed on a CD? 

Right now I have my $3,000 in a HYSA 
I have a 3.60% APY. Started it in December 2023 and I earned $16.00 already and now it’s March. 

So my question is.. Should my mom move her money to a CD for 18 months?

Saved my money religiously, lived under my means and just went to work every single day. 
If I didn’t get in that car accident I’ll be worth double then what I’m worth now. During the time I bought my car I couldn’t find absolutely anything and cars were being sold with very high mileage at an expensive price. So I took a leap of faith with a 2020 suv with 12k miles.

But I look at this as a learning experience. My car went from 21k to 17k. Carmax offered me 17k. I look at this as just renting a car. Cars depreciate so much over time. The car is okay I mean it gets me from point A to point B. But just because it’s a 2020 doesn’t make it better than my 2006 Honda. I don’t plan on keeping this car until the wheels fall off. When I get in a better financial situation I’m trading it over for a car that fits me more!

Ok. So some background info:    

Bought townhome in 2005 right before the crash.  30 year fixed, 5.875 interest. (Normal at the time.)   
Refinanced under the harp program in 2012--when the place was worth mothing-- to a 30 year 4.1.  Monthly payment went down of course.    

We *were* going to make extra payments to keep on schedule with the original 30 year loan timeframe. Didn't happen. So we have technically 23 years left on the refinanced 30 year at 4.1  

I can now get a refi to a 15 year for 2.1 because interest rates are so low, with roughly $3,800 closing costs.  This would put us right back on schedule (we've been in the house 15 years), but it *would* have a slightly higher payment of about 120 dollars per month because of the shorter timeframe.  Obviously, even thought monthly cost is higher, a *great deal* more would be going toward principal a month because of the 15 year timeframe.    

However, we don't want to be here for 15 years.  Maybe 5 max? We have kiddos now and townhome is feeling small. We are trying to save tons of cash for a new house. (50 k per year for 4-5 years...we live in an expensive area.) However, we *may* keep this house as a rental as we can get good cash for it per month, and it would make a great long term investment/potential in-law home in the future.   

*But what we are trying to figure out is the break even point and if a refi is worth it since we don't plan on being here more than 5 years as our primary residence.*    

**So, with a new mortgage that would be more a month but paying down debt faster, how do I calculate break even?**   

I entered all the info in a refinance calculator and it says ""-31 months"" to break even.""  Obviously, they are expressing months negatively since the mortgage is higher per month, but can I also use this number to calculate break even? I am assuming that timeframe (not quite 3 years) is the amount if time to make up the 3,800 dollars in closing costs with saved interest?   

Current: 190,000 left on loan  
23 years left  
Principal Amount per month:458  
Interest 652  
Escrow 412  

Refi  
Principal Amount per month: 898 (A big difference of course!)   
Interest 332 (A big difference of course!)  
Escrow 412??  (Would this rise since the home is being ""resold?""  Do my property taxes change here? State of FL.)  

Anyway, obviously a refi is the better *long-term option* as it would save something like 84k over the life over the 23 years left on the original, but with a 5 year time span here, we are just trying to see whether it is worth it to refi. Also, I assume if I keep it as a rental, it is worth the re-fi to have someone else pay down our debt faster. I don't think the 120 a month negatively impacts us that much in a rental situation. 

Anyway, thoughts are greatly appreciated here! If I can confidently say ""not quite 3 years is the break even"", then I feel better. If it is shorter, then great but if it is longer, I need to understand how to calculate that as well.","Present Bias, Status Quo Bias, Sunk Cost Fallacy","The individual is struggling to calculate the break-even point for refinancing their mortgage, which indicates a Present Bias, as they are prioritizing short-term costs over long-term benefits.

I understand rates are set by the government then they make their margin on top of that, *but I guess I don't understand if they are just beating a competitor by a bit because that's all they can do, or if they are able to offer ore discounts now but are NOT doing it because I haven't' played hardball.*

If you can do that then fine.""","Anchoring, Negotiation Optimism (related to Overconfidence), Present Bias","The statement exhibits several biases.

l2phmi,Feed_Me_No_Lies,"Is cashflow king? We plan to only be in house for 2-5 more years, Should I refi and kick back a mortgage to a 30 year and save/invest the difference, or do 15 year?

So I understand the general principal of ""If you can make more money investing somewhere else than your mortgage and are comfortable with it, do that"", but I wanted your opinions.  (43 years old, 2 kids, no other debt, plenty of retirement savings.) 

189,000 left on a townhome currently worth about 370,000.  

**Currently a 30 year refi at 3.0 would drop our monthly payment 279 a month.  
A 15 year at 2.5 would raise it 185 a month.**

Difference between the two mortgage types is 465 a month. (Rounded to 500 for investing down below.) 

Our plan is so save for 2-5 years more, and have a fat down payment on a house we really want. We have 100k in a high interest savings account as a start.  (We are in a townhome and want a house for our kids, but we need to save more to be able to have an affordable mortgage in our area. Hence the savings.  We think we can save 50 grand a year from our businesses, hence the 2-4 year savings goal we've set to be able to get a house we really want in a few years.)  

MAIN SCENARIOS: 
I've looked at amortization tables, and after two years, we would have 14 more grand paid off on principal with the 15 year.

*However,* even if we just saved the 500 a month from the 30 year refi into a regular savings account, we would have 12 grand at the end of that same two years in our pockets/savings acount/investment/529 etc, a roughly 2,000 difference that the 30 year ""Costs us"" over the same time as the 15. 

I would most likely invest in the market in a target fund or total stock market fund or another vehicle as the amount over the few years we will be in the house won't really amount to much of a dent in the savings goals for the new house over the next few years, so that 12 grand we save on the 30 would be something like 13 grand assuming a 5 percent return.  I understand that's not guaranteed.  

Most of our house savings would come from our businesses and I understand that in general, you don't put money in the market you will need in the next 5 years. This extra fund would just be additional long term investing more than likely. I know statistically stock market is an average about 7 percent year to year with wild fluctuations in any year.

Break even on these refis is about 14 months BTW. 

I think the 30 year gives us both more option for financial growth and more flexibility if we decided to rent this house later or whatever.

I guess I am asking...what would YOU guys do here?

Hey there. Some background:

Middle aged male taking care of two young kiddos so right now my income is very limited for the first time in my life.  Husband and I have been together 20 years and we're legally married. 

I haven't bought a new car in 20 years as I kept one for 16 years and this old model current one for almost 5.  Well, my car (the current family car) is having troubles and really does need to be replaced. (It's a 2006 BTW.)

There is a bit of confusion and more than a little misplaced male pride in my post as I find myself in a situation I've never been in before. My husband is doing really well right now, so any cash for a car is just from what he has earned as I have no personal savings...for the first time in my life. We have plenty of joint savings so the money is not what is really bothering me here. 

All of our finances are co mingled and I know thinking of ""his and his money"" is silly when you are working together as a personal and financial unit, but I have no idea how to buy a car with no income myself. 

Does he have to co sign if we take a loan?  Should he buy the car outright and have me as a second driver? If we go used we will probabally pay cash, but we might take a low interest credit union loan out if we buy new.

ptswhf,Feed_Me_No_Lies,"I need to Buy a car and I'm wondering in this low-interest environment if I should take a car loan instead of paying cash and then put the cash into the market long-term. Advice?

Hey there. So we have 25k cash sitting doing NOTHING in a savings account.  This is earmarked for a new car. I will probabally buy a used car costing around that or a new suv-type vehicle that is 35k or so and keep it for many years. I'm currently driving a 2006 suv that is breaking down and I need an SUV type vehicle for my family car.

I am starting to think it would be a better long-term play to take the 25k (or most of it) and put it in the market long-term in vanguard index total stock market where it will make (on average but not guaranteed) more than the loan percentage on a new or used car is. 

I did this with my mortgage: We refinanced back to a 30 instead of a 15  and took the extra amount we would be paying a month on the 15 (about 500 a month) and I dump it into the market for long-term growth.  I do this monthly and automatically as if our mortgage really is a 15 year and we ""have"" to pay that extra.  Meanwhile, I get the growth of 500 dollars that is (on average but not guaranteed), much better than my 3.00 percent mortgage. 

Is there any good reason not to do this with a car? Seems like I am missing out on a lot of interest compounding if I take that cash and dump it right into a depreciating asset, but I wanted to get your opinions. 

Some additional details:
1. Income in our family is fine, and if we needed more cash, we have plenty we can extract from one of our two business, or plenty of non-retirement stock we could get at if we needed.  

2.  That cash for the car has been sitting there for years doing nothing and I don't feel good about that. I love compounding.  (It was an Old account from spouse, they felt more comfortable with it sitting there years ago etc.) That's my primary motivation for asking the question.  

3.  We have 100k cash sitting in an account doing nothing for a down payment on a home in a few years. I hate that this money is ""doing nothing"" while we decide on where we can live in the next few years, so that's more motivation for me to ""make this car money work for me."" I know you aren't' supposed to throw money in the market you are gonna need in the next  years.  

Anyway, bah blah blah. I understand if we had no other cash or needed this 25k for an emergency fund I wouldn't put i tin the market. But, since this is ""Car money"" anyway, I am trying to see the best route here.

So I live in a high cost of living area, and with interest rates being what they are and the market being what it is, it would be almost impossible to find anything for my growing family in the area we want to be that comes even close to only three times our annual incomes if we want to stay in our current radius.

We are looking at two houses to get out of our townhome we've been in for 15 years. We have about two years of income in equity in it that we will use for a new house.

Here's the thing: Even The ""cheaper"" house options we are looking at are still 4.7 times our yearly incomes in our city. You can get cheaper, but they are in areas we have no desire to live in either do to school districts, commute time etc.

The one that is more expensive--but we would put more cash down on to ensure a DTI under 36--is 7.3 times our annual income.

We have no other loan obligations except our current mortgage, so we are in good shape there, and we have several years of income saved up in cash for down payment of 25-30 percent on either home, but the total home prices in my area are simply MUCH more expensive than 3 times our yearly income.

So is this old rule even valid anymore? Or is the answer ""move to a cheaper neighborhood farther out"" the correct one here?

So.  Aside form the question of ""Do you want to be a landlord?"", I am wrestling with on whether or not to keeping our townhome as a rental property long-term since it will only generate 5-8 k of profit a year on 26-28k of rent depending on various factors of maintenance and whether or not it takes one month or more to turnaround etc.

Stats:
Townhome Built in 2005, we are the original owners. It is our primary residence, but we are looking at a new home for our growling family.  
Our unit is one of the smallest available homes/units in a VERY high cost of living/sought planned neighborhood, so it rents nicely and quickly from what I have seen.  
We have Had it for 15 years so we rode out the financial crisis dip for a decade and a huge amount of equity just recovered post-pandemic.  
Would sell today for about 440,000 with about 190,000 being left on the mortgage.  (Recently re-fied back to a 30 year to drop the payments in case we decided to rent it out, and it would only take a year to recoup the costs of the refi.)    

So, we have Equity of 220k-240k  if we sold depending on with a realtor or not yada yada yada. 
It would rent for about 2,400 giving us about 26,400 of rental income a year with a one month turnaround. (Less if longer turnaround obviously.) 

I think long term, it's a great investment but with what is left on on the note, high association fees, lawn maintenance and everything else, even renting at the market rate of about 2,400 a month, we only have that 5-8k profit at the end of each year. 

Now, we would either put down that profit on the note, or put in a higher earning investment since the note is at 3.0 percent.

Hey there. So here are some stats:

Current townhome (been there 17 years) is too small. We now have two young kids and need a bigger garage, an extra bedroom, more appropriate yard etc.  We refinanced our townhome about a year ago with the plans to save for 2-3 years for a house. Instead of a 15 year, we refinanced to a 30 and are taking the 500 a month that would have gone to principal with a 15 and we are investing in long-term index funds to grow more than it would on a 3.1 percent loan.  

However, an opportunity came up on a new house and we would need to make an offer by close of business...TODAY. lol. (Couple in new house is only showing this weekend and taking an offer that comes up this weekend.  They will receive multiple offers, potentially over asking. Real estate in my state is RED HOT with post-covid transplants from California and New York jacking up sale prices.) 

**NUMBERS:**
We are 45 years old, two young kids ages 3 and 5. So we will be 60 when youngest is graduating high-school/going off to college.  
Current townhome could probabally sell for $500,000. (Maybe more. Maybe QUITE a bit more as the location is PREMIUM and NO current inventory. Maybe even $600,000 but I will use the low number for estimation purposes.)   
We owe $190,000 @30 year, 3.1 (Refinanced about a year ago.)  
Potential equity in our pockets after 6 percent realtor fees assuming the above sales price: $275,000 (roughly)
**EDIT: Income is variable. Husband makes about 200-250k profit in business a year, I make 10-40k in mine.**.  

**New house:**
Asking $500,000  
We will probabally offer 510,000 to stave off other local offers but we won't play if someone from California offers 75k over asking or whatever. 

Now, We plan on being in this home to get our kids through high school (They are currently Ages 3 and 5). I don't think this is a ""forever home"", but we pan on being there for 10-15 years for sure.)

We have the current cash to put the 20 percent down without using the equity in our current townhome, but we could use the equity in our current home to lower the principal to something like $85,000. (275,000 equity from current home plus 110,000 cash savings we have for down payment.)   

So the question is: Do we want to lower the principal to something like 85,000 with that extra equity money, or should we just do the 20 percent down and finance $408,000?

*Assuming I could afford the higher mortgage monthly amount either way and that we would be approved for a higher mortgage*, what would you guys do? $275,000 equity is a lot of cash. Current loans are like 3.8 percent for 30 year (they have jumped up quite a bit.)  I am comfortable with risk and long-term investing. If we DIDN'T  use the equity to lower the new mortgage, we would definitely grow it: Vanguard index funds in a our brokerage account to sit for years and grow.   

Soo....what do ya think? Lower that new house principal by putting a lot more than 20 percent down, or grow our current house equity in vanguard index funds long-term to be used for things like college, braces, or whatever?  

So other things to consider: We both own our own businesses, but it is true that good fortune can change and the great financial years we have been experiencing may change.  That makes the idea of a lower monthly payment attractive, but if we had that cash still growing in the market/savings, we could dump that in a re-fi if we needed to if our business fortunes change.  

What do ya think given our age, our kids' ages and the home prices/our savings etc?  (Maybe we put more than 20, but less than the full equity amount as another option?)

I've was let go from my job a few days ago, and I was wondering if you have some financial advice for what I should be doing, if some larger expenses I've been considering make sense, and if you have any advice in general for handling a layoff? 

**Assets**: 

Savings: $17,500 (7 months of my living expenses)

Unemployment: I just filed for unemployment so I dont know for sure, but it estimates out around $187-263 a week after taxes. I'm not sure how to apply for the additional $600 a week as part of the CARES Act ($450 after taxes), or if I'll be eligible for it. 

**Living Expenses**: $2,500 a month. I not to have many non-essential expenses. I'm evaluating my bank statements, but right now there's not too much I can cut out except maybe changing my health insurance.

I wanted to get your thoughts on these additional expenses that I'm debating on that would come out of the $17,500:

-A used car ($6000-8000 or 3-4 months of living expenses): My car was totaled a week before everything shutdown in my state. It's limiting to my job search without one, but I realize how important having money now is. I have friends who could drive me to interviews, but I'd need to see what public transportation is still open for more reliable transportation. 

-Bicycle repairs ($300-400 or around a quarter of a month of living expenses): I have an old bike from a few years ago which probably needs a lot of work. Fixing it would be able to get me further/quicker to places.

-A laptop (estimated cost: $1800 or 1 month of living expenses): I have a computer, but it's old and freezes up/dies quite often which makes applying for jobs or doing anything with it frustrating. I wanted this for use as a day planner, to apply for jobs faster, and take courses online for certificates. 

-College education: I've wanted to go to college for a long time, but my meetings with school financial advisers had to be postponed. I have no idea what financial aid I'd get, but it seems that it would be $15,000-$20,000 a year paying out of pocket if I went full time, and I'd be going part time. I'd mostly be concerned about needing money for living expenses, so I dont know how I'd be able to go to school without also working full time. 

-Health insurance: It's expensive relative to my financial information, but I had few options. I qualify now to change my health insurance policy, so I can get one that's cheaper (maybe down to $90-$110 a month, but it wont cover much, and itd be more for if I didnt want to pay more than 20k in an emergency).

2. Do you have any advice about how to best handle this situation financially/productively while staying sane and healthy?

Hi, I'm in my mid-twenties and I'm looking to improve my financial health and credit score as much as possible?

I currently net about $2,000 a month after taxes, and have a 10 month emergency fund in my savings account at a credit union (which is needed for me with the ongoing financial climate). 

I have two credit cards, one from a couple years ago, and the other I got just a few weeks ago. The first one has a small limit and the second one is a bit larger. They don't have rewards, but I'm using them up to 25% of their limit each month for everyday expenses to build my credit, and they're set to automatic full-balance payments. 

I've never had student loans, or any other type of loans. I really want a shining credit score for future loans and apartments, and I'm planning on going to college in about six months. The bank I got my second credit card from said I already had a pretty good credit score from the first credit card line being open for the last few years, even though I never used it, so I was able to qualify for the """"premium"""" card with no annual fees. 

**Questions**

My emergency fund is just sitting in my savings account. Should I move it to a different type of account, like a money-market account? 

How much can I increase my credit score in the next six to eight months through responsibly utilizing my credit cards, and how long will it take to get a great score overall (800+)? 

How long should I wait before opening another credit card to increase my credit score (maybe one with rewards) if I just opened a card a few weeks ago, and plan on having a credit check for a new apartment in six to eight months?

Now I know going over 30% utilization will negatively impact my score, but will paying off my utilization multiple times in the month increase it?

Lastly, I currently have a credit card from a bank that I never use, and I'm looking to increase my limits.

i87wqa,FinancialFlora,"Which of these supplementary insurance plans are actually worth the cost in this situation?

I'm in my mid-twenties and started my first job that's offering semi-decent health insurance, but its also offering a lot more. Besides your basic medical, dental, and eye-care, which of these insurance plans make sense financially? 

Background: I've always had weird health conditions and an irregular heart, nothing known to be life threatening though. I'm in okayish shape, but I'm mostly on my own financially, I live month to month and any kind of accident that'd put me out of work would eliminate my income entirely. I work an office job that I could likely work mostly if not completely remote if needed.

**All offered insurance types cost about $10-12 dollars each per month**

*Short-term disability: This one is the one I question most. My work already provides free long-term disability, and this one requires me to be working atleast part-time and gives me the equivalent of about 55% of my weekly gross income each week. I need to have the disability for atleast 8 days before it starts to pay out. 

*Critical illness: Pays out a maximum of $13,000 for one-time diagnoses of large-scale health issues like terminal cancer, strokes, or heart attacks. Only 25% of that amount for things like brain tumors and heart surgery.

I suck at negotiating, and find myself continually taken advantage of, and Im trying to learn how you build good negotiating skills?

I told a friend about trying to work on my skills at negotiating and being treated fairly at work (as I'm often too nice and get taken advantage of from not advocating for myself properly). I was given a few seasons of the show ""Pawn stars"" and books on negotiating and people skills with others, but many of them seem too focused on ""mind hacks"".

A lot of these books heavily rely on these social engineering tactics that the authors stress heavily affects negotiation and communication with other people: mirroring their body language, repeating the last few words of others sentences in the form of a question, talking like a therapist (""it seems like *blank* is important to you and you're *insert feeling* about *insert current circumstances*) and wait for them to elaborate with more information that might help the negotiation, being overly apologetic when you can't do something, etc. 

While in fairness, most of these tactics are in theory just designed to get the other person to reveal more information by getting them to elaborate on their feelings and wants to help the negotiation, I'm having trouble identifying which of these tactics are useful and which are real or would actually make things worse.

So the APY is 50 basis points with no minimum balance requirements.  Why don't more people talk about this Marcus deal on here?  This sub seems to prefer Ally Bank by a large margin.  Is there something sketchy about Marcus by Goldman Sachs that I don't know about?",None,,"The user exhibits biases that indicate a tendency to seek validation from others, follow the crowd, and potentially underestimate the credibility of well-established financial institutions."
mzae20,fizzle63,"Can short and ultrashort Treasury bond funds outperform a 0.5% HYSA?

I'm thinking about putting a chunk of my emergency savings into a taxable account and experimenting with different cash, near-cash, and bond configurations to see if I can get a stable steady return.","Loss Aversion, Overconfidence, Mental Accounting","The statement reveals several biases. The user's consideration of moving a chunk of their emergency savings into a taxable account with potentially higher-yielding but riskier investments, such as short and ultrashort Treasury bond funds, suggests Loss Aversion, as they may be seeking to mitigate the risk of inflation eroding their purchasing power, but also potentially exposing themselves to some level of risk. The user's confidence in being able to ""experiment"" with different configurations and achieve a ""stable steady return"" implies Overconfidence, as they may be underestimating the complexity of managing a portfolio and the risks involved. Additionally, the user's separation of their emergency savings from other investments, considering them for a ""taxable account"", indicates Mental Accounting, where they are treating different types of money (emergency savings vs. other investments) as if they have different properties or uses.","The user exhibits a tendency to take on potentially excessive risk in pursuit of returns while underestimating complexity, reflecting biases towards loss aversion, overconfidence, and mental accounting."
