# Personality and Bias Detection from User Data

This project bridges psychology and machine learning to extract personality traits and detect financial decision-making biases from user-generated text. It leverages cutting-edge NLP models, fine-tuning techniques, and behavioral science principles to analyze linguistic patterns and infer deeper psychological insights.

## 🧠 Introduction

This project consists of two core objectives:

1. **Personality Trait Extraction:**  
   Predict the Big Five (OCEAN) personality traits from user-generated content using transformer-based models and prompting strategies.

2. **Financial Bias Detection:**  
   Identify cognitive biases in financial decision-making by analyzing user posts, primarily from social media and forums like Reddit.

## 🔍 Problem Statements

### Problem 1: Personality Trait Extraction
Classify user posts into OCEAN traits:
- **Openness:** Imagination, abstract thinking.
- **Conscientiousness:** Discipline, planning.
- **Extraversion:** Sociability, energy.
- **Agreeableness:** Empathy, politeness.
- **Neuroticism:** Anxiety, emotional instability.

### Problem 2: Financial Bias Detection
Detect 16 well-documented financial biases such as:
- Loss Aversion
- Overconfidence
- Herd Behavior
- Status Quo Bias
- Sunk Cost Fallacy

## 🧭 Bias Detection

### Financial Biases Detected
16 financial biases including:
- **Loss Aversion**
- **Status Quo Bias**
- **Sunk Cost Fallacy**
- **Mental Accounting**
- **Framing Effect**

### Prompt Strategy
```text
You are a behavioral finance expert. Analyze the following statement and determine if any of the financial decision-making biases from the list below are present...
```

### Bias Detection Experiments
1. **No Keywords** — Trait-based scoring.
2. **With Keywords** — Direct keyword match.
3. **Semantic Expansion** — Fuzzy matching using similar terms.
4. **Filtered Analysis** — Only consider decision-relevant posts.

---

## 📈 Visual Insights

- **Reddit Analysis:** 6708 posts from 334 users
- **Conscientiousness** was dominant (~98% users).
- **Loss Aversion** and **Status Quo** were the most frequent biases.
- **Bias Clusters:** Present Bias co-occurs strongly with Status Quo and Sunk Cost.

### Sample Plots
- Trait correlation matrices
- Heatmaps of co-occurring biases
- Boxplots and distribution curves for bias intensity

## 🔮 Conclusion and Future Work

### Key Takeaways
- Prompting and fine-tuning LLMs yields reliable detection of both personality and bias.
- OCEAN traits are inferable from informal short posts with high accuracy.
- Behavioral biases tend to cluster, calling for multi-bias intervention strategies.

### Future Scope
- Develop a conversational assessment bot.
- Integrate insights for **personalized financial advice**.
- Extend to real-time decision support systems.
